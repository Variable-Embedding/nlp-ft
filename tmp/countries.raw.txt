'''Canada''' is a country in the northern part of [[North America]]. Its [[Provinces and territories of Canada|ten provinces and three territories]] extend from the [[Atlantic Ocean|Atlantic]] to the [[Pacific Ocean|Pacific]] and northward into the [[Arctic Ocean]], covering {{convert|9.98|e6km2|e6sqmi|2|abbr=off}}, making it the world's [[List of countries and dependencies by area|second-largest country by total area]]. Its southern and western [[Canada–United States border|border with the United States]], stretching {{convert|8891|km|mi}}, is the world's longest bi-national land border. Canada's capital is [[Ottawa]], and its three [[List of census metropolitan areas and agglomerations in Canada|largest metropolitan areas]] are [[Toronto]], [[Montreal]], and [[Vancouver]].

Various [[Indigenous peoples in Canada|Indigenous peoples inhabited what is now Canada]] for thousands of years before European colonization. Beginning in the 16th century, [[British colonization of the Americas|British]] and [[French colonization of the Americas|French]] expeditions explored and later settled along the Atlantic coast. As a consequence of [[Military history of Canada|various armed conflicts]], France ceded nearly all of [[New France|its colonies in North America]] in 1763. In 1867, with the union of three [[British North America]]n colonies through [[Canadian Confederation|Confederation]], Canada was formed as a [[Federalism|federal]] [[dominion]] of four provinces. This began an [[Territorial evolution of Canada|accretion of provinces and territories]] and a process of increasing autonomy from the [[United Kingdom]]. This widening autonomy was highlighted by the [[Statute of Westminster 1931]] and culminated in the [[Canada Act 1982]], which severed the vestiges of legal dependence on the [[Parliament of the United Kingdom|British Parliament]].

Canada is a [[parliamentary democracy]] and a [[constitutional monarchy]] in the [[Westminster system|Westminster tradition]], with a [[Monarchy of Canada|monarch]] as [[head of state]] and a [[Prime Minister of Canada|prime minister]] who serves as the chair of the [[Cabinet of Canada|Cabinet]] and [[Government of Canada|head of government]]. The country is a [[Commonwealth realm]] and is [[Official bilingualism in Canada|officially bilingual]] at the federal level. It [[International rankings of Canada|ranks among the highest]] in international measurements of government transparency, civil liberties, quality of life, [[economic freedom]], and education. It is one of the world's most ethnically diverse and [[Multiculturalism in Canada|multicultural]] nations, the product of [[Immigration to Canada|large-scale immigration]] from many other countries. Canada's [[Canada–United States relations|long and complex relationship with the United States]] has had a significant impact on [[Economy of Canada|its economy]] and [[Culture of Canada|culture]].

As a highly [[developed country]], Canada has the [[List of countries by GDP (nominal) per capita|seventeenth-highest nominal per-capita income globally]] as well as the [[List of countries by Human Development Index|thirteenth-highest]] ranking in the [[Human Development Index]]. Its advanced economy is the [[List of countries by GDP (nominal)|tenth-largest in the world]], relying chiefly upon its abundant natural resources and well-developed international trade networks. Canada is part of several major international and intergovernmental institutions or groupings including the [[United Nations]], [[NATO]], the [[Group of Seven|G7]], the [[Group of Ten (economics)|Group of Ten]], the [[G20]], the [[United States–Mexico–Canada Agreement]], the [[Commonwealth of Nations]], the [[Organisation internationale de la Francophonie]], and the [[Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation]] forum.

Canada is a federation composed of ten provinces and three [[territory (administrative division)|territories]].

Using its spending powers, the federal government can initiate national policies in provincial areas, such as the ''[[Canada Health Act]]''; the provinces can opt out of these, but rarely do so in practice. [[Equalization payments]] are made by the federal government to ensure reasonably uniform standards of services and taxation are kept between the richer and poorer provinces.<ref>{{Cite book |last1=Clemens |first1=Jason |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=yc6RakXxLy0C&pg=PA8 |title=Beyond Equalization: Examining Fiscal Transfers in a Broader Context |last2=Veldhuis |first2=Niels |publisher=[[Fraser Institute]] |year=2012 |isbn=978-0-88975-215-3 |page=8}}</ref>

'''Saint Vincent and the Grenadines''' ({{IPAc-en|audio=En-us-Saint Vincent and the Grenadines.ogg|ˌ|ɡ|r|ɛ|n|ə|ˈ|d|iː|n|z}}), also frequently [[Pars pro toto#Geography|known simply as]] '''Saint Vincent''', is an island country in the Caribbean. It's located in the southeast [[Windward Islands]] of the  [[Lesser Antilles]], which lies in the [[West Indies]] at the southern end of the eastern border of the [[Caribbean Sea]] where the latter meets the Atlantic Ocean.

Its {{convert|369|km2|abbr=on}} territory consists of the main island of [[Saint Vincent (Antilles)|Saint Vincent]] and the northern two-thirds of the [[Grenadines]], a chain of 32 smaller islands. Some of the Grenadines are inhabited&nbsp;— [[Bequia]], [[Mustique]], [[Union Island]], [[Canouan]], [[Petit Saint Vincent]], [[Palm Island, Grenadines|Palm Island]], [[Mayreau]], [[Young Island (Grenadines)|Young Island]]&nbsp;— while others are not: [[Tobago Cays]], [[Baliceaux]], [[Battowia]], [[Quatre]], [[Petite Mustique]], [[Savan (island)|Savan]] and [[Petit Nevis]]. Most of Saint Vincent and the Grenadines lies within the [[Hurricane Alley]].

To the north of Saint Vincent lies [[Saint Lucia]], to the east is [[Barbados]], and [[Grenada]] lies to the south. Saint Vincent and the Grenadines is a densely populated country for its size (over 300 inhabitants/km<sup>2</sup>) with approximately {{UN_Population|Saint Vincent and the Grenadines}} inhabitants.{{UN_Population|ref}}

[[Kingstown]] is the capital and main port. Saint Vincent has a [[British Empire|British colonial]] history, and is now part of the [[Organisation of Eastern Caribbean States]], [[Caribbean Community|CARICOM]], the [[Commonwealth of Nations]], the [[Bolivarian Alliance for the Americas]] and the [[Community of Latin American and Caribbean States]] (CELAC).

==Etymology==
[[Christopher Columbus]], the first European to reach the island, named it after [[St. Vincent of Saragossa]], whose feast day it was on the day Columbus first saw it (22 January 1498). The name of the Grenadines refers to the Spanish city of [[Granada]], but to differentiate it from the island of the same name, the diminutive was used. Before the arrival of the Spaniards, the Carib natives who inhabited the island of St. Vincent called it Youloumain, in honour of Youlouca, the spirit of the rainbows, who they believed inhabited the island.<ref name="CIA World Factbook – St Vincent">{{cite web |url=https://www.cia.gov/the-world-factbook/countries/saint-vincent-and-the-grenadines/ |title=CIA World Factbook – St Vincent |access-date= 7 July 2019}}</ref><ref name="thecommonwealth.org">{{cite web |url=http://thecommonwealth.org/our-member-countries/st-vincent-and-grenadines/history |title=The Commonwealth – St Vincent and the Grenadines |access-date= 7 July 2019}}</ref>

==History==
{{Main|History of Saint Vincent and the Grenadines|French West Indies|British West Indies}}

===Pre-colonial period===
Before the arrival of Europeans and Africans in the 16th century, various [[Amerindian]] groups passed through or settled on [[St. Vincent and the Grenadines]], including the [[Ciboney]], [[Arawaks|Arawak]], and [[Island Caribs|Carib]] people.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://thecommonwealth.org/our-member-countries/st-vincent-and-grenadines/history |title=The Commonwealth – St Vincent and the Grenadines |access-date= 7 July 2019}}</ref><ref>[http://indigenousreview.blogspot.com.au/#stash.9WFLBXgH.dpuf Yurumein (Homeland): A Documentary on Caribs in St. Vincent]</ref> The island now known as Saint Vincent was originally named [[Youloumain]]<ref>{{Cite book |title=Historic Account of Saint Vincent, the Carib Youroumayn, the island of the Karaÿbes |author=Frere.

=== European arrival and early colonial period ===
It is thought that [[Christopher Columbus]] sighted the island in 1498, giving it the name St Vincent.<ref name="CIA World Factbook – St Vincent"/> The indigenous [[Garifuna]] people, who became known as the "Black Caribs", aggressively prevented European settlement on Saint Vincent.<ref name="britannica.com">{{cite web |url=https://www.britannica.com/place/Saint-Vincent-and-the-Grenadines |author=David Lawrence Niddrie, Richard Tolson, Adrian Fraser| work=Encyclopædia Britannica |title= Saint Vincent and the Grenadines |date= 21 October 2019|access-date= 7 July 2019}}</ref><ref name="thecommonwealth.org"/>

=== French and British colonisation and the First Carib War ===
Various attempts by the English and Dutch to claim the island proved unsuccessful, and it was the French who were first able to colonise the island, settling in the town of [[Barrouallie]] on the leeward side of St Vincent in 1719.<ref name="britannica.com"/> The French brought with them enslaved African prisoners of war to work the plantations of sugar, coffee, indigo, tobacco, cotton and cocoa.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://svgancestry.com/index.php/st-vincent-timeline/ |title=St Vincent Genealogy Resources |website=svgancestry.com |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120321165131/http://svgancestry.com/index.php/st-vincent-timeline |archive-date=21 March 2012}}</ref>

[[File:SaintVincent Carib Treaty Negotiation 1773.jpg|thumb|upright|Depiction of the 1773 treaty negotiations between the British and the [[Black Carib]]s]]
The British captured the island and drove out the French from Barrouallie during the [[Seven Years' War]], a claim confirmed with the [[Treaty of Paris (1763)]].<ref name="britannica.com"/> On taking control of the island in 1763, the British laid the foundations of [[Fort Charlotte, Saint Vincent|Fort Charlotte]] and also brought with them enslaved African prisoners of war to work on the island plantations. The Black Caribs however, opposed to the British presence, went into open conflict against the British, starting the [[First Carib War]] which lasted from 1772 to 1773.<ref name="britannica.com"/>

During the [[Anglo-French War (1778–1783)]] the French [[French capture of Saint Vincent|recaptured St Vincent]] in 1779.  However, the British regained control under the [[Treaty of Versailles (1783)]].<ref name="britannica.com"/><ref name="thecommonwealth.org"/>

=== British colonial period and the Second Carib War ===
{{Main|British Windward Islands}}
The uneasy peace between the British and the Black Caribs led to the [[Second Carib War]], which lasted from 1795 to 1796.<ref name="britannica.com"/> The Black Caribs were led by [[Garifuna]] Paramount Chief [[Joseph Chatoyer]] and they were supported by the French, notably the radical [[Victor Hugues]] from the island of [[Martinique]]. Their revolt and uprising was eventually put to an end in 1797 by British General Sir [[Ralph Abercromby]]; a peace treaty agreement was made which resulted in almost 5,000 Black Caribs being exiled to [[Roatán]], an island off the coast of [[Honduras]], and to [[Belize]] and [[Baliceaux]] in the Grenadines.<ref name="thecommonwealth.org"/>
 
In 1806 the building of Fort Charlotte was completed.{{citation needed|date=July 2019}}

[[File:Flag of Saint Vincent and the Grenadines (1907-1979).svg|thumb|Colonial flag (to 1979)]]

The British [[abolitionism in the United Kingdom|abolished]] slavery in Saint Vincent (as well as in the other [[British West Indies]] colonies) in 1834, and an apprenticeship period followed which ended in 1838.<ref name="thecommonwealth.org"/><ref name="britannica.com"/> After its end, labour shortages on the plantations resulted, and this was initially addressed by the immigration of indentured servants; in the late 1840s many Portuguese immigrants arrived from [[Madeira]] and between 1861 and 1888 shiploads of Indian labourers arrived.<ref name="britannica.com"/> Conditions remained harsh for both former slaves and immigrant agricultural workers, as depressed world sugar prices kept the economy stagnant until the turn of the century. The economy then went into a period of decline with many landowners abandoning their estates and leaving the land to be cultivated by liberated slaves.{{citation needed|date=October 2019}}

The [[Opobo]] king [[Jaja of Opobo|Jaja]] of [[Nigeria]] was exiled to {{nowrap|St. Vincent}} after his 1887 arrest by the British for shipping cargoes of [[palm oil]] directly to [[Liverpool]] without the intermediation of the [[National African Company]].{{citation needed|date=October 2019}}

In 1902, the volcano [[Soufrière (volcano)|La Soufrière]] erupted, killing 1,500–2,000 people; much farmland was damaged, and the economy deteriorated.<ref name="thecommonwealth.org"/><ref name="britannica.com"/><ref name="Pyle, David"/>

Saint Vincent and the Grenadines passed through various stages of colonial status under the British. A representative assembly was authorised in 1776, Crown Colony government was installed in 1877, a [[legislative council]] was created in 1925 with a limited franchise,<ref name="britannica.com"/> and [[Universal suffrage|universal adult suffrage]] was granted in 1951.<ref name="britannica.com"/> During the period of its control of Saint Vincent and the Grenadines, Britain made several attempts to unify the island with other Windward Islands as a single entity, with the aim of simplifying British control in that sub-region through a single unified administration.<ref name="britannica.com"/> In the 1960s, the British again tried to unify all of its regional islands including Saint Vincent into one united single entity under British control, unified politically. The unification was to be called the [[West Indies Federation]] and was driven by a desire to gain independence from British government.  However, the attempt collapsed in 1962.<ref name="britannica.com"/>

Saint Vincent was granted "associate statehood" status by Britain on 27 October 1969.<ref name="britannica.com"/>  This gave Saint Vincent complete control over its own internal affairs but was short of full independence in law.{{citation needed|date=October 2019}}

In April 1979 La Soufrière erupted again. Although no one was killed, thousands were evacuated and again there was extensive agricultural damage.<ref name="Pyle, David"/>

On 27 October 1979 Saint Vincent and the Grenadines became the last of the Windward Islands to gain full independence,<ref name="britannica.com"/><ref name="thecommonwealth.org"/> and this date is now the country's [[List of national independence days|Independence Day]], a [[Public holidays in Saint Vincent and the Grenadines|public holiday]].<ref name="CIA World Factbook – St Vincent"/> The country opted to remain within the [[British Commonwealth]], retaining Queen Elizabeth as [[Monarchy of Saint Vincent and the Grenadines|Monarch]], represented locally by a [[Governor-General of Saint Vincent and the Grenadines|Governor-General]].<ref>{{Cite web|last=corporateName=Commonwealth Parliament; address=Parliament House|first=Canberra|title=Sir David Smith &quot;An Australian Head of State: An Historical and Contemporary Perspective [1]&quot;|url=https://www.aph.gov.au/About_Parliament/Senate/Powers_practice_n_procedures/~/~/link.aspx?_id=D704CA6CD1B549AF8654FDCFBA383150&_z=z|access-date=2020-08-12|website=www.aph.gov.au|language=en-AU}}</ref>

===Post-independence era===
[[File:Sir James Mitchell SVG.png|thumb|right|James Fitz-Allen Mitchell, the Vincentian prime minister from 1984 to 2000]]
[[Milton Cato]] of the centre-left [[Saint Vincent Labour Party]] (SVLP) was the country's first Prime Minister (he had been Premier since 1974), ruling until he was defeated in the [[1984 Vincentian general election]] by [[James Fitz-Allen Mitchell]] of the centre-right [[New Democratic Party (Saint Vincent and the Grenadines)|New Democratic Party]] (NDP).<ref name="britannica.com"/> During Cato's time in office there was a brief rebellion on [[Union Island]] in December 1979 led by [[Lennox 'Bumba' Charles]]; apparently inspired by the recent revolution on Grenada, Charles alleged neglect of Union by the central government.

==Geography==
{{Main|Geography of Saint Vincent and the Grenadines}}
[[File:Saint Vincent and the Grenadines.svg|thumb|A map of [[Saint Vincent Island|Saint Vincent]] and the [[Grenadines]]]]

Saint Vincent and the Grenadines lies to the west of [[Barbados]], south of [[Saint Lucia]] and north of [[Grenada]] in the [[Windward Islands]] of the [[Lesser Antilles]], an [[island arc]] of the [[Caribbean Sea]]. The islands of Saint Vincent and the Grenadines include the main island of [[Saint Vincent (island)|Saint Vincent]] {{convert|344|km2|sqmi|abbr=on}} and the northern two-thirds of the [[Grenadines]] {{convert|45|km2|sqmi|abbr=on}}, which are a chain of smaller islands stretching south from Saint Vincent to Grenada.

'''Japan''' ({{lang-ja|日本}}, ''Nippon'' {{IPA-ja|ɲippoꜜɴ||ja-nippon(日本).ogg}} or ''Nihon'' {{IPA-ja|ɲihoꜜɴ||ja-nihon(日本).ogg}}) is an [[island country]] in [[East Asia]], located in the northwest [[Pacific Ocean]]. It is bordered on the west by the [[Sea of Japan]], and extends from the [[Sea of Okhotsk]] in the north toward the [[East China Sea]] and [[Taiwan]] in the south. Part of the [[Ring of Fire]], Japan spans [[Japanese archipelago|an archipelago]] of [[List of islands of Japan|6852 islands]] covering {{convert|comma=5|377,975|sqkm|sqmi|sp=us}}; the five main islands are [[Hokkaido]], [[Honshu]], [[Shikoku]], [[Kyushu]], and [[Okinawa Island|Okinawa]]. [[Tokyo]] is Japan's capital and largest city; other major cities include [[Yokohama]], [[Osaka]], [[Nagoya]], [[Sapporo]], [[Fukuoka]], [[Kobe]], and [[Kyoto]].

Japan is the [[List of countries and dependencies by population|eleventh-most populous country]] in the world, as well as one of the [[List of countries and dependencies by population density|most densely populated]] and [[Urbanization by country|urbanized]]. About three-fourths of the [[Geography of Japan|country's terrain]] is mountainous, concentrating its population of 125.57 million on narrow coastal plains. Japan is divided into [[Prefectures of Japan|47 administrative prefectures]] and [[List of regions of Japan|eight traditional regions]]. The [[Greater Tokyo Area]] is the [[List of largest cities|most populous metropolitan area]] in the world, with more than 37.4 million residents.

Japan [[Japanese Paleolithic|has been inhabited]] since the [[Upper Paleolithic]] period (30,000 BC), though the first mentions of the archipelago appear in [[Book of Han|Chinese chronicles]] from the 1st century AD. Between the 4th and 9th centuries, the kingdoms of Japan became unified under an [[Emperor of Japan|emperor]] and his [[Imperial House of Japan|imperial court]] based in [[Heian-kyō]]. Beginning in the 12th century, political power was held by a series of military dictators (''[[Shogun|shōgun]]'') and feudal lords (''[[Daimyo|daimyō]]''), and enforced by a class of warrior nobility (''[[samurai]]''). After a [[Sengoku period|century-long period of civil war]], the country was reunified in 1603 under the [[Tokugawa shogunate]], which enacted an [[Sakoku|isolationist foreign policy]]. In 1854, a [[Perry Expedition|United States fleet]] forced Japan to [[Bakumatsu|open trade to the West]], which led to [[Boshin War|the end of the shogunate]] and the [[Meiji Restoration|restoration of imperial power]] in 1868. In the [[Meiji (era)|Meiji period]], the [[Empire of Japan]] adopted a [[Meiji Constitution|Western-styled constitution]] and pursued a program of [[Industrialisation|industrialization]] and [[Modernization theory|modernization]]. In 1937, Japan [[Second Sino-Japanese War|invaded China]]; in 1941, it entered [[World War II]] as an [[Axis powers|Axis power]]. After suffering defeat in the [[Pacific War]] and [[Atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki|two atomic bombings]], Japan [[Surrender of Japan|surrendered]] in 1945 and came under a seven-year [[Occupation of Japan|Allied occupation]], during which it adopted a [[Constitution of Japan|new constitution]]. Since 1947, Japan has maintained a [[Unitary state|unitary]] [[Parliamentary system|parliamentary]] [[constitutional monarchy]] with a [[Bicameralism|bicameral]] legislature, the [[National Diet]].

Japan is a [[great power]] and a member of numerous international organizations, including the [[United Nations]] (since 1956), the [[OECD]], and the [[Group of Seven]]. Although it has [[Article 9 of the Japanese Constitution|renounced its right to declare war]], the country maintains [[Japan Self-Defense Forces|Self-Defense Forces]] that are ranked as the world's [[Military#Capability development|fourth-most powerful military]]. After World War II, Japan experienced [[Japanese economic miracle|high economic growth]], becoming the [[List of countries by largest historical GDP|second-largest economy]] in the world by 1990 before being surpassed by China in 2010. Despite [[Economic stagnation|stagnant growth]] since the [[Lost Decade (Japan)|Lost Decade]], the [[Economy of Japan|country's economy]] remains the [[List of countries by GDP (nominal)|third-largest by nominal GDP]] and the [[List of countries by GDP (PPP)|fourth-largest by PPP]]. A leader in the [[Automotive industry in Japan|automotive]] and [[Electronics industry in Japan|electronics industries]], Japan has made significant contributions to [[Science and technology in Japan|science and technology]]. Ranked the [[List of countries in Asia and Oceania by Human Development Index|second-highest country]] on the [[Human Development Index]] in Asia after [[Singapore]], Japan has the world's [[List of countries by life expectancy|second-highest life expectancy]], though it is experiencing a [[Aging of Japan|decline in population]]. The [[culture of Japan]] is well-known around the world, including its [[Japanese art|art]], [[Japanese cuisine|cuisine]], [[Music of Japan|music]], and [[Japanese popular culture|popular culture]], which encompasses prominent [[Anime|animation]] and [[Video games in Japan|video game]] industries.

It covers a land area of {{convert|617|km2|abbr=in}} and reported a population of 165,595 in the 2010 census.<ref name=census>{{cite web|url=http://192.147.231.244:9090/stats/index.php/statistics/population |title=Population & Vital Statistics |publisher=Central Statistics Office of St. Lucia |access-date=18 November 2016 |url-status=bot: unknown |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161119182317/http://192.147.231.244:9090/stats/index.php/statistics/population |archive-date=19 November 2016 }}</ref> Its capital is [[Castries]].

The French were the first Europeans to settle on the island. They signed a treaty with the native [[Island Caribs]] in 1660. England took control of the island from 1663 to 1667. In ensuing years, it was at war with France fourteen times, and the rule of the island changed frequently (it was ruled seven times each by the French and British). In 1814, the British took definitive control of the island. Because it switched so often between British and French control, Saint Lucia was also known as the "Helen of the West Indies" after the Greek mythological character, [[Helen of Troy]].

[[Representative government]] came about in 1840 (universal [[suffrage]] was established in 1953). From 1958 to 1962, the island was a member of the [[West Indies Federation]]. On 22 February 1979, Saint Lucia became an independent state and a member of the [[Commonwealth of Nations]].<ref name="GovC">

[[Saint Helena|St. Helena]], another island, is also named for an historical woman—the mother of Emperor Constantine—but St. Helena is a Dependent Territory of the United Kingdom and is not a sovereign nation.  Legend states French sailors were shipwrecked at St. Lucia on 13 December, the feast day of St. Lucy, naming the island in honor of ''Sainte Lucie.''{{sfn|Harmsen|Ellis|Devaux|2014|p=14}}

==History==
{{main|History of Saint Lucia}}

===Pre-colonial period===
The first proven inhabitants were the [[Taino people|Arawak]]s, though there may have been other native peoples prior to this. The Arawak are believed to have come from northern [[South America]] sometime around [[AD]] 200–400, as there are numerous [[archeology|archaeological]] sites on the island where specimens of their well-developed [[pottery]] have been found. There is evidence to suggest that the Arawak called the island ''Iouanalao'', meaning 'Land of the Iguanas', due to the island's high number of [[iguana]]s.<ref name=AllAbout>{{Cite web|url=https://allaboutstlucia.com/|title=All About St. Lucia|website=All About St. Lucia}}</ref>

The more aggressive [[Island Caribs|Caribs]] arrived around AD 800, and seized control from the Arawaks by killing their men and assimilating the women into their own society.<ref name=AllAbout/> They called the island ''Hewanarau'', and later ''Hewanorra'' (Ioüanalao, or "there where iguanas are found").{{sfn|Harmsen|Ellis|Devaux|2014|p=10}}

===Early European period===
[[Christopher Columbus]] may have sighted the island during his fourth voyage in 1502, since he made landfall on [[Martinique]], yet he does not mention the island in his log. [[Juan de la Cosa]] noted the island on his map of 1500, calling it El Falcon, and another island to the south Las Agujas. A Spanish [[Cedula|cédula]] from 1511 mentions the island within the Spanish domain, and a globe in the Vatican made in 1520, shows the island as Sancta Lucia.

In the late 1550s, the French [[pirate]] [[François le Clerc]] (known as ''Jambe de Bois'', due to his wooden leg) set up a camp on [[Pigeon Island (Saint Lucia)|Pigeon Island]], from where he attacked passing Spanish ships. In 1605, an English vessel called the ''Oliphe Blossome'' was blown off-course on its way to [[Guyana]], and the 67 colonists started a settlement on Saint Lucia, after initially being welcomed by the Carib chief Anthonie. By 26 September 1605 only 19 survived following continued attacks by the Carib chief Augraumart, so the settlers fled the island.{{sfn|Harmsen|Ellis|Devaux|2014|pp=16–21}}

===French Colony===
{{Main|French West Indies}}

In 1664, Thomas Warner (son of [[Thomas Warner (explorer)|Sir Thomas Warner]], the governor of [[St Kitts]]) claimed Saint Lucia for England. He brought 1,000 men to defend it from the French, but after only two years, only 89 survived with the rest dying mostly due to disease. In 1666, the [[French West India Company]] resumed control of the island, which in 1674 was made an official French crown colony as a dependency of Martinique.{{citation needed|date=August 2020}}

Both the British and the French found the island attractive after the slave-based sugar industry developed, and during the 18th century the island changed ownership or was declared neutral territory a dozen times, although the French settlements remained and the island was a de facto French colony well into the eighteenth century.

In 1722, [[George I of Great Britain]] granted both Saint Lucia and [[Saint Vincent (island)|Saint Vincent]] to [[John Montagu, 2nd Duke of Montagu|The 2nd Duke of Montagu]]. He in turn appointed [[Nathaniel Uring]], a merchant sea captain and adventurer, as deputy-governor. Uring went to the islands with a group of seven ships, and established settlement at Petit Carenage. Unable to get enough support from British warships, he and the new colonists were quickly run off by the French.<ref>{{DNB|wstitle=Montagu, John (1688?-1749)|first=Henry Manners |last=Chichester|volume=38}}</ref>

During the [[Seven Years' War]], Britain occupied Saint Lucia for a year. Britain handed the island back to the French at the [[Treaty of Paris (1763)|Treaty of Paris]] in 1763. Like the English and Dutch on other islands, the French began to develop the land for the cultivation of sugar cane as a commodity crop on large plantations in 1765.

The British occupied the island again between 1778 and 1784.

In January 1791, during the [[French Revolution]], the [[National Assembly (French Revolution)|National Assembly]] sent four ''commissaires'' to St Lucia to spread their revolutionary philosophy. By August 1791, slaves began to abandon their estates and Governor de Gimat fled.  In December 1792, Lt. [[Jean-Baptiste Raymond de Lacrosse]] arrived with revolutionary pamphlets, and the impoverished whites and free people of color began to arm themselves as ''patriots''. On 1 February 1793, France declared war on England and Holland, and General [[Nicolas Xavier de Ricard]] took over as Governor.  The [[National Convention]] abolished enslavement on 4 February 1794, but St. Lucia fell to a British invasion led by Vice Admiral [[John Jervis, 1st Earl of St Vincent|John Jervis]] on 1 April 1794. [[Morne Fortune]] became ''Fort Charlotte''. Soon, a patriot army of resistance, ''L'Armee Française dans les Bois'', began to fight back.  Thus started the [[First Brigand War]].{{sfn|Harmsen|Ellis|Devaux|2014|pp=60–65}}

A short time later the British invaded the island as a part of the war with France that had recently broken out. On 21 February 1795 a group of locals under the nominal control of [[Victor Hugues]] defeated a battalion of British troops at Vieux Fort and Rabot. In 1796, [[Castries]] was burned as part of the conflict. [[John Moore (British Army officer)|General John Moore]] retook Fort Charlotte in 1796 with the [[27th (Inniskilling) Regiment of Foot|27th Inniskilling Fusiliers]] after two days of bitter fighting. As an honour, the Fusiliers' regimental colour was displayed on the flagstaff of the captured fortress at [[Morne Fortune]] for an hour before being replaced by the [[Union Jack]].<ref>{{cite book|last=Trimble|first=Copeland|title=Historical record of the 27th (Inniskilling) Regiment from the period of its institution as a volunteer corps till the present time|publisher=William Clowes|year=1876|url=https://archive.org/details/historicalrecor02goog|page=[https://archive.org/details/historicalrecor02goog/page/n83 49]}}</ref> Moore would then participate in British efforts to repress the slave rebels until falling ill of [[yellow fever]], upon which he returned to Britain before 1798.

In 1803, the British regained control of the island. Many of the rebels escaped into the thick rainforest where they evaded capture and established [[maroon communities]].<ref>''They Called Us the Brigands. The Saga of St. Lucia's Freedom Fighters'' by Robert J Devaux</ref>

The slavery on the island was continued for a short time, but anti-slavery sentiment was rising in Britain. The British stopped the import of slaves by anyone, white or coloured, when they [[Slave Trade Act 1807|abolished the slave trade]] in 1807.

France and Great Britain continued to contest Saint Lucia until the British secured it in 1814, as part of the [[Treaty of Paris (1814)|Treaty of Paris]] ending the [[Napoleonic Wars]]. Thereafter, Saint Lucia was considered part of the [[British Windward Islands]] colony.

The institution of slavery was abolished on the island in 1836, as it was [[Slavery Abolition Act 1833|throughout the British Empire]]. After abolition, all former slaves had to serve a four-year "apprenticeship," to accustom them to the idea of freedom. During this period, they worked for their former masters for at least three-quarters of the work week. Full freedom was duly granted by the British in 1838. By that time, people of African ethnicity greatly outnumbered those of ethnic European background. Some people of Carib descent also comprised a minority on the island.

Castries' harbour was protected by a system of 60 surrounding forts. Along the top of Morne Fortune there are six military sites, building work by the French started in 1768, and the British completed the work by 1890. They include Fort Charlotte (Old Morne Fortress), the Apostle's Battery (1888–1890), The Powder Magazine built by the French in the 1750s, Provost's [[Redoubt]] (1792) built as a lookout point, and the Combermere [[barracks]].<ref>{{cite book|last1=Cameron|first1=Sarah|title=St Lucia & Dominica Footprint Focus Guide: Includes Fort-de-France ...|date=2013|publisher=Footprint Travel Guides|isbn=9781909268319|page=32|edition=1|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=9MH9AgAAQBAJ&q=bagshaw+st+lucia&pg=PA32|access-date=1 November 2017}}</ref>

The best preserved installation is a battery at La Toc Point, completed in 1888 it was not abandoned till 1905.

The [[Second World War]] visited the island directly during the [[Battle of the Caribbean]], when a German [[U-boat]] attacked and sank two British ships in [[Castries]] harbour on 9 March 1942.<ref name=Hubbard>{{cite book|last1=Hubbard|first1=Vincent|title=A History of St. Kitts|date=2002|publisher=Macmillan Caribbean|isbn=9780333747605|page=[https://archive.org/details/historyofstkitts00vinc/page/117 117]|url=https://archive.org/details/historyofstkitts00vinc/page/117}}</ref>{{sfn|Harmsen|Ellis|Devaux|2014|p=275}}

In the mid-twentieth century, Saint Lucia joined the [[West Indies Federation]] (1958–1962) when the colony was dissolved. In 1967, Saint Lucia became one of the six members of the West Indies Associated States, with internal self-government. In 1979, it gained full independence under [[Sir John Compton]] of the conservative [[United Workers Party (Saint Lucia)|United Workers party (UWP)]]. The new country chose to remain within the [[British Commonwealth]] and to retain Queen Elizabeth as [[Monarchy of Saint Lucia|Monarch]], represented locally by a [[Governor-General of Saint Lucia|Governor-General]].

===Post-independence era===
Compton's initial term as Prime Minister lasted only a few months, as he was defeated by the left-leaning [[Saint Lucia Labour Party]] (SLP) under [[Allan Louisy]] in the [[1979 Saint Lucian general election]].<ref name="timeline">{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/americas/1210528.stm|title=Timeline: St Lucia|work=[[BBC Online]]|publisher=BBC News|access-date=2 July 2010 | date=29 October 2009}}</ref> The SLP sought to improve ties with socialist countries in the region such as [[Cuba]], though the economy was severely affected by [[Hurricane Allen]] in 1980.<ref name="Encyclopedia Britannica – St Lucia">{{cite web |url=https://www.britannica.com/place/Saint-Lucia |title=Encyclopedia Britannica – St Lucia |access-date= 30 June 2019}}</ref> Louisy was replaced as Prime Minister by [[Winston Cenac]] in 1981.

==Geography==
{{Main|Geography of Saint Lucia}}
[[File:Saint Lucia geography map en.png|thumb|upright=0.9|A map of Saint Lucia.]]
The [[volcano|volcanic]] island of Saint Lucia is more mountainous than most [[Caribbean]] islands, with the highest point being [[Mount Gimie]], at {{convert|950|m|ft|-1|abbr=off}} above [[sea level]].<ref name="CIA World Factbook – St Lucia"/><ref name="Encyclopedia Britannica – St Lucia"/> Two other mountains, the [[Pitons]], form the island's most famous landmark.<ref name="CIA World Factbook – St Lucia"/><ref name="Encyclopedia Britannica – St Lucia"/> They are located between [[Soufrière, Saint Lucia|Soufrière]] and [[Choiseul, Saint Lucia|Choiseul]] on the western side of the island. Saint Lucia is the only island in the world that contains a drive-in volcano.{{dubious|date=December 2019}} Forests cover about 77% of the land area.<ref name="CIA World Factbook – St Lucia"/>

There are a number of [[List of Caribbean islands#Saint Lucia|small islands]] off the coast, the largest of which are the [[Maria Islands, St Lucia|Maria Islands]] in the south-east.

The capital city of Saint Lucia is [[Castries]] (population 60,263) where 32.4% of the population lives. Other major towns include [[Gros Islet]], [[Soufrière, Saint Lucia|Soufrière]], and [[Vieux Fort]]. The population tends to be concentrated around the coast, with the interior more sparsely populated, due to the presence of dense forests.<ref name="CIA World Factbook – St Lucia"/><ref name="Encyclopedia Britannica – St Lucia"/>

===Climate===
The local climate is [[tropical climate|tropical]], specifically a [[tropical rainforest climate]] (Af) under the [[Köppen climate classification]], moderated by northeast [[trade winds]], with a dry season from 1 December to 31 May, and a wet season from 1 June to 30 November (referred to by locals as the hurricane season).

Average daytime temperatures are around {{convert|30|C|F|1|abbr=on}}, and average nighttime temperatures are around {{convert|24|C|F|1|abbr=on}}. Since it is fairly close to the equator, the temperature does not fluctuate much between winter and summer. Average annual rainfall ranges from {{convert|1300|mm|1|abbr=on}} on the coast to {{convert|3810|mm|0|abbr=on}} in the mountain rainforests.

[[File:Qualibou Caldera tomography.png|thumb|Topography of the Soufriere Volcanic Complex]]
The geology of St. Lucia can be described as composing three main areas.  The oldest, 16–18 [[Megaannum|Ma]], [[volcanic]] rocks are exposed from Castries northward and consist of [[eroded]] [[basalt]] and [[andesite]] centres.  The middle, central highlands, portion of the island consists of dissected andesite centres, 10.4 to 1 Mya, while the lower southwest portion of the island contains recent activity from the Soufriere Volcanic Centre (SVC).  This SVC, centered about the [[Qualibou]] [[caldera|depression]], contains [[pyroclastic flow]] deposits, [[lava flow]]s, [[intrusive rock|domes]], [[block and ash flow]] deposits, and [[volcanic crater|explosion craters]].  This depression's perimeter includes the town of Soufriere, Mount Tabac, Mt. Gimie, Morne Bonin, and Gros Piton.  At {{convert|10|km}} in diameter, though the western portion is open towards the Grenada [[basin (geology)|basin]], the depression formed as recently as 100 kya.  The depression is noted for its [[geothermal gradient|geothermal activity]], especially at [[Sulphur Springs, Saint Lucia|Sulphur Springs]] and [[Soufrière Estate]]s, a [[phreatic eruption]] in 1776, and recent [[seismic activity]] (2000–2001).<ref name="Lindsay">{{cite journal|last1=Lindsay|first1=Jan|last2=Trumbull|first2=Robert|last3=Schmitt|first3=Axel|last4=Stockli|first4=Daniel|last5=Shane|first5=Phil|last6=Howe|first6=Tracy|title=Volcanic stratigraphy and geochemistry of the Soufriere Volcanic Centre, Saint Lucia with implications for volcanic hazards|journal=Journal of Volcanology and Geothermal Research|date=2013|volume=258|pages=126–142|doi=10.1016/j.jvolgeores.2013.04.011}}</ref>

Eroded andesitic [[stratovolcano]]es to the north east of the depression include Mt. Gimie, Piton St Esprit, and Mt. Grand Magazin, all greater than 1 Ma in age.  Andesitic and [[dacite]] pyroclastic flows from these volcanoes are found at Morne Tabac dome (532 [[kiloannus|ka]]), Morne Bonin dome (273 kya), and Bellevue (264 kya). [[Avalanche]] deposits from the formation of the Qualibou depression are found offshore, and in the massive blocks of Rabot, Pleisance, and Coubaril.  The dacitic domes of [[Petit Piton]] (109 kya) and [[Gros Piton]] (71 kya) were then [[extrusive rock|extruded]] onto the depression floor accompanied by the Anse John (104 kya) and La Pointe (59.8 kya) pyroclastic flows.  Later, pyroclastic flows include [[pumice]]-rich Belfond and Anse Noir (20 kya).  Finally, the dacitic domes of Terre Blanche (15.3 kya) and Belfond (13.6 kya) formed within the depression.<ref name=Lindsay/>

==Economy==
{{Main|Economy of Saint Lucia}}
[[File:St. Lucia Export Treemap.png|thumb|upright=1.6|A proportional representation of St. Lucia's exports.]]

The [[United Nations]] categorizes Saint Lucia as a [[Small Island Developing States|Small Island Developing State]], a designation similar to a [[developing country]] with a few substantial differences due to Saint Lucia's island nature.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://sustainabledevelopment.un.org/topics/sids |title=Small Island Developing States |access-date=13 March 2018 |publisher=United Nations Department of Economic and Social Affairs Division for Sustainable Development |location=New York}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=https://sustainabledevelopment.un.org/topics/sids/list |title=List of Small Island Developing States |access-date=13 March 2018 |publisher=United Nations Department of Economic and Social Affairs Division for Sustainable Development |location=New York}}</ref> The [[tertiary sector of the economy|services sector]] accounted for 82.8% of GDP, followed by [[Industrial sector|industry]] and [[agriculture]] at 14.2% and 2.9%, respectively.<ref name="CIAStLucia">{{cite web |url=https://www.cia.gov/the-world-factbook/countries/saint-lucia/ |title=Saint Lucia |access-date=13 March 2018 |publisher=Central Intelligence Agency |work=CIA World Factbook}}</ref>

An educated workforce and improvements in roads, communications, water supply, sewerage, and port facilities have attracted foreign investment in tourism and in petroleum storage and transshipment. However, with the US, Canada, and Europe in recession, tourism declined by double digits in early 2009. The recent change in the [[European Union]] import preference regime and the increased competition from Latin American bananas have made economic diversification increasingly important in Saint Lucia.

Saint Lucia has been able to attract foreign business and investment, especially in its offshore banking and tourism industries, which is Saint Lucia's main source of revenue.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.commonwealthofnations.org/sectors-saint_lucia/business/ |title=Find a business in Saint Lucia |publisher= Commonwealth of Nations | location=London}}</ref> The manufacturing sector is the most diverse in the Eastern Caribbean area, and the government is trying to revitalise the banana industry. Despite negative growth in 2011, economic fundamentals remain solid, and GDP growth should recover in the future.

Inflation has been relatively low, averaging 5.5 percent between 2006 and 2008. Saint Lucia's currency is the [[East Caribbean Dollar]] (EC$), a regional currency shared among members of the Eastern Caribbean Currency Union (ECU). The [[Eastern Caribbean Central Bank]] (ECCL) issues the EC$, manages monetary policy, and regulates and supervises commercial banking activities in member countries. In 2003, the government began a comprehensive restructuring of the economy, including elimination of price controls and privatization of the state banana company.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.heritage.org/Index/Country/SaintLucia |title=Saint Lucia Economy: Population, GDP, Inflation, Business, Trade, FDI, Corruption |publisher=Heritage.org |access-date=21 December 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110220014738/http://www.heritage.org/index/Country/SaintLucia |archive-date=20 February 2011 |url-status=dead |df=dmy-all }}</ref>

===Tourism===
{{Main|Tourism in Saint Lucia}}
[[File:At_the_top_of_Pigeon_Island.jpg|thumb|Gros Islet and Rodney Bay as seen from Pigeon Island]]
Tourism is vital to Saint Lucia's economy. Its economic importance is expected to continue to increase as the market for bananas have become more competitive. Tourism tends to be more substantial during the dry season (January to April), often referred to as the tourist season. Saint Lucia tends to be popular due to its tropical weather and scenery and its beaches and resorts.

Other tourist attractions include a drive-in [[volcano]], [[Sulphur Springs, Saint Lucia|Sulphur Springs]] (in Soufrière), zip lining in at Sault Falls, Dennery, the [[St Lucia Botanical Gardens|Botanical Gardens]], the Majestic twin Peaks "The Pitons", a world heritage site, the rain forests, several options of boat trips, Frigate Island Nature Reserve (Operated by the St. Lucia National Trust), Dennery, and Pigeon Island National Park, which is home to Fort Rodney, an old British military base.

The majority of tourists visit Saint Lucia as part of a cruise. Most of their time tends to be spent in [[Castries]], although [[Soufrière, Saint Lucia|Soufriere]], [[Marigot Bay]], [[Rodney Bay]] and [[Gros Islet]] are also tourist destinations.{{citation needed|date=August 2020}}

The current Minister of Tourism is [[Dominic Fedee]], he has been in his role since 2016.

{{Main|Culture of Saint Lucia}}
[[File:Day250castriesreduxd.jpg|thumb|upright=1.35|The [[Saint Lucia Jazz Festival]] in [[Castries]].]]

The culture of Saint Lucia has been influenced by African, East Indian, French, and English heritage. One of the secondary languages is [[Saint Lucian French Creole|Saint Lucian French Creole or Kwéyòl]], spoken by almost all of the population.<ref name="sltb-about" /><ref name="usstate-bgnote" />

Saint Lucia boasts the second highest ratio of [[Nobel Prize|Nobel]] laureates produced with respect to the total population of any sovereign country in the world. Two winners have come from Saint Lucia: [[William Arthur Lewis (economist)|Sir Arthur Lewis]] won the [[Bank of Sweden Prize in Economic Sciences in Memory of Alfred Nobel|Nobel Prize in Economics]] in 1979, and the poet [[Derek Walcott]] received the [[Nobel Prize in Literature]] in 1992.

===Festivals===
Saint Lucian cultural festivals include [[La Woz|La Rose]] celebrated on August 30th and [[La Magwit|La Marguerite]] on October 17th, the first representing a native Saint Lucian fraternal society known as the Order of the Rose that is fashioned in the mould of [[Rosicrucianism]], and the second representing its traditional rival, the native Saint Lucian equivalent of [[Freemasonry]] known as the Order of the Marguerite.<ref>{{cite web |url = http://www.flightstostlucia.com/culture-of-st-lucia |title=St. Lucia Culture |publisher=Flights To St Lucia |access-date=12 March 2010}}</ref> References to their origins as versions of pre-existing external secret societies can be seen in a mural painted by Dunstan St Omer, depicting the holy trinity of [[Osiris]], [[Horus]], and [[Isis]].

The biggest festival of the year is the [[Saint Lucia Jazz Festival]].  Held in early May at multiple venues throughout the island, it draws visitors and musicians from around the world.

Traditionally in common with other Caribbean countries, Saint Lucia held a [[carnival]] before [[Lent]]. In 1999, the government moved Carnival to mid-July to avoid competing with the much larger [[Trinidad and Tobago carnival]] and so as to attract more overseas visitors.

In May 2009, Saint Lucians commemorated the 150th Anniversary of West Indian Heritage on the island.

===Cuisine===
{{Further|Saint Lucian cuisine}}

Saint Lucia's national dish is green figs and saltfish.

The island's cuisine is a unique blend of West African {{Citation needed|date=January 2014}}, European (mainly British and French) and Indian cuisine; this creates dynamic meal dishes such as [[macaroni pie]], Stew chicken, [[rice and peas]], fish broth or fish water, and [[soups]] packed full with fresh locally produced vegetables. Typical essential foodstuffs are potatoes, onions, [[celery]], [[thyme]], [[coconut milk]], the very hot [[Scotch bonnet|scotch bonnet peppers]], flour, and cornmeal. All mainstream meat and poultry are eaten in St. Lucia; meat and seafood are normally stewed and browned to create a rich gravy sometimes served over [[ground provisions]] or rice. The island is also home to the famous fried dough, known by many as a bake or Johnny Cake. These bakes can be served with different sides, such as saltfish which is either sautéed or lightly fried along with red, green peppers, onions, and seasoned well. This is the most common way for bake to be prepared, though it can also be served with meats such as stewed chicken or beef.

One popular Saint Lucian dessert is the pastry called a turnover. The pastry is made with sweetened coconut that is boiled with spices, some sugar, and whatever is satisfying. It is boiled until cooked to a light or dark brown colour; then the mixture is separated into various size portions placed on a rolled out piece of dough. The dough size may vary too depending on how much is desired, and lastly, it is baked in the oven until the colour of the turnover is nicely browned.

Due to Saint Lucia's Indo-Caribbean population, curry is very popular; however due to the blend of cooking styles, curry dishes have a distinct Caribbean twist. Roti is typically served as a fast food meal: the bread itself is very flat (sometimes very thin) and is wrapped around curried vegetables such as chickpeas and potato, seafood such as shrimp and conch, or meats such as chicken, beef, goat, and liver.

'''Saint Kitts and Nevis''' ({{IPAc-en|audio=En-us-Saint Kitts and Nevis.ogg|-|ˈ|k|ɪ|t|s|...|ˈ|n|iː|v|ɪ|s}}), officially known as the '''Federation of Saint Christopher and Nevis''',<ref>{{cite web|url=http://pdba.georgetown.edu/Constitutions/Kitts/kitts83.html|title=1983 Saint Kitts and Nevis Constitution|website=pdba.georgetown.edu|access-date=30 August 2017}}</ref> is an [[island country]] in the [[West Indies]]. Located in the [[Leeward Islands]] chain of the [[Lesser Antilles]], it is the smallest [[sovereign state]] in the Western Hemisphere, in both [[List of countries by area|area]] and [[List of countries by population|population]].<ref name="cia.gov">{{cite web |url=https://www.cia.gov/the-world-factbook/countries/saint-kitts-and-nevis/ |title=CIA World Factbook- St Kitts and Nevis |website=www.cia.gov |access-date= 10 July 2019}}</ref> The country is a [[Commonwealth realm]], with [[Elizabeth II]] as Queen and [[head of state]].<ref name="cia.gov"/><ref name="britannica.com">{{cite web |url=https://www.britannica.com/place/Saint-Kitts-and-Nevis |title=Enclopedia Britannica – St Kitts and Nevis |access-date= 10 July 2019}}</ref> It is the only [[Federated state|federation]] in the Caribbean.

The capital city is [[Basseterre]], located on the larger island of [[Saint Kitts]].<ref name="cia.gov"/> [[Basseterre]] is also the main port for both passenger entry (via cruise ships) and cargo.  The smaller island of [[Nevis]] lies approximately {{cvt|3|km|mi|0}} to the southeast of Saint Kitts, across a shallow channel called The Narrows.<ref name="cia.gov"/>

The British dependency of [[Anguilla]] was historically also a part of this union, which was then known collectively as [[Saint Christopher-Nevis-Anguilla]].  However, Anguilla chose to secede from the union and remains a [[British overseas territory]].<ref name="cia.gov"/> To the north-northwest lie the islands of [[Sint Eustatius]], [[Saba]], [[Saint Barthélemy]], [[Saint Martin (island)|Saint-Martin/Sint Maarten]] and Anguilla. To the east and northeast are [[Antigua and Barbuda]], and to the southeast is the small uninhabited island of [[Redonda]] (part of Antigua and Barbuda) and the island of [[Montserrat]].

Saint Kitts and Nevis were among the first islands in the Caribbean to be colonized by Europeans. Saint Kitts was home to the first British and French colonies in the [[Caribbean]], and thus has also been titled "The Mother Colony of the West Indies".<ref>{{Cite book|title=The Caribbean : a walking and hiking guide|last=Adkins, Leonard M.|date=1999|publisher=Hunter Pub|isbn=0585042586|edition= 3rd|location=Edison, NJ|pages=178|oclc = 43474982}}</ref> It is also the most recent British territory in the Caribbean to become independent, gaining independence in 1983.

== Etymology ==<!--redirected from 'Etymology of Saint Kitts and Nevis'-->
[[File:Nevispeak1.jpg|thumb|left|Clouds covering Nevis Peak]]
Saint Kitts was named {{lang|crb|Liamuiga}}, which roughly translates as 'fertile land', by the [[Island Caribs|Kalinago]], who originally inhabited the island.<ref name=":0">{{Cite book|title=Peoples of the Caribbean : an encyclopedia of archeology and traditional culture|last=Saunders, Nicholas J.|date=2005|publisher=ABC-CLIO|isbn=1576077012|location=Santa Barbara, Calif.|pages=260–261|oclc = 62090786}}</ref> The name is preserved via St. Kitts's tallest peak, [[Mount Liamuiga]]. Nevis's pre-Columbian name was {{lang|crb|Oualie}}, meaning "land of beautiful waters".{{citation needed|date=November 2018}}

It is thought that [[Christopher Columbus]], the first European to see the islands in 1493, named the larger island {{lang|es|San Cristóbal}}, after [[Saint Christopher]], his [[patron saint]] and that of travellers. New studies suggest that Columbus named the island {{lang|es|Sant Yago}} (Saint James), and that the name {{lang|es|San Cristóbal}} was in fact given by Columbus to the island now known as [[Saba]], {{cvt|20|mi|km|order=flip}} northwest. It seems that {{lang|es|San Cristóbal}} came to be applied to the island of St. Kitts only as of the result of a mapping error.{{citation needed|date=November 2018}} No matter the origin of the name, the island was well documented as {{lang|es|San Cristóbal}} by the 17th century.<ref name="cia.gov"/> The first English colonists kept the English translation of this name, and dubbed it ''St. Christopher's Island''. In the 17th century, a common nickname for Christopher was ''Kit(t)''; hence, the island came to be informally referred to as ''Saint Kitt's Island'', later further shortened to ''Saint Kitts''.<ref name="cia.gov"/>

Columbus gave Nevis the name {{lang|es|San Martín}}.<ref name=":0" /> The current name ''Nevis'' is derived from a Spanish name {{lang|es|Nuestra Señora de las Nieves}}, meaning 'Our Lady of the Snows'.<ref name="cia.gov"/> It is not known who chose this name for the island, but it is a reference to the story of a 4th-century [[Miracle#Catholic Church|Catholic miracle]]: a summertime snowfall on the [[Esquiline Hill]] in Rome.<ref>{{Cite Catholic Encyclopedia |wstitle=Our Lady of the Snow }}</ref> It is thought that the white clouds which usually wreathe the top of Nevis Peak reminded someone of the story of a miraculous snowfall in a hot climate.<ref name="cia.gov"/> The island of Nevis, upon first British settlement, was referred to as {{lang|es|Dulcina}}, a name meaning 'sweet one' in Spanish.{{citation needed|date=November 2018}} Eventually, the original Spanish name was restored and used in the shortened form, ''Nevis''.

Today the [[Constitution of Saint Kitts and Nevis|Constitution]] refers to the state as both ''Saint Kitts and Nevis'' and ''Saint Christopher and Nevis'', but the former is the one most commonly used, however the latter is generally used for diplomatic relations.

===Pre-colonial period===

The name of the first inhabitants, [[Pre-Arawakan languages of the Greater Antilles|pre-Arawakan peoples]] who settled the islands perhaps as early as 3000 years ago, is not known.<ref>See for example [http://www.arch.soton.ac.uk/Projects/default.asp?ProjectID=12 Nevis Heritage excavation reports, 2000–2002], Department of Archaeology, University of Southampton.

===European arrival and early colonial period===
[[Christopher Columbus]] was the first European to sight the islands in 1493.<ref name="thecommonwealth.org">{{cite web |url=http://thecommonwealth.org/our-member-countries/st-kitts-and-nevis/history |title=Commonwealth – History of St Kitts and Nevis |access-date= 10 July 2019}}</ref><ref name="britannica.com"/> The first settlers were the English in 1623, led by [[Thomas Warner (explorer)|Thomas Warner]], who established a settlement at [[Old Road Town]] on the west coast of St Kitts after achieving an agreement with the Carib chief [[Ouboutou Tegremante]].<ref name=Hubbard/>{{rp|15–18}}<ref name="britannica.com"/> The French later also settled on St Kitts in 1625 under [[Pierre Belain d'Esnambuc]].<ref name="britannica.com"/> As a result, both parties agreed to partition the island into French and English sectors. From 1628 onward the English also began settling on Nevis.<ref name="britannica.com"/>

The French and English, intent on self-enrichment through exploitation of the island's natural resources,<ref>{{cite book|first=Patrick|last=Taylor et. al. (ed.)|date=2010|title=The Encyclopedia of Caribbean Religions, Volume 1 A-L.|location=Urbana, IL, Chicago, IL, and Springfield, IL|publisher=[[University of Illinois Press]]|page=886}}</ref> soon encountered resistance, with the native Caribs (Kalinago) waging war throughout the first three years of the settlements' existence.<ref>Cobley, 1994, p. 28.</ref><ref name=cobley27>Cobley, 1994, p. 27.</ref> The Europeans thus resolved to rid themselves of this problem once and for all. To facilitate this objective, an ideological campaign was waged by colonial chroniclers, dating back to the Spanish, as they produced literature which systematically denied Kalinago humanity (a literary tradition carried through the late-seventeenth century by such authors as [[Jean-Baptiste du Tertre]] and Pere Labat).<ref name=cobley27 /> In 1626 the Anglo-French settlers joined forces to [[Kalinago Genocide of 1626|massacre the Kalinago]] at a place that became known as [[Bloody Point]], allegedly to pre-empt an imminent Carib plan to expel or kill all European settlers.<ref>{{cite book |last=Jonnard|first=Claude M.|date=2010|title=Islands in the Wind: The Political Economy of the English East Caribbean.|location=Bloomington, IN|publisher=iUniverse|page= number not available}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|first=Jean-Baptiste|last=Du Tertre|author-link=Jean-Baptiste Du Tertre|title= Histoire générale des Antilles habitées par les François, 2 vols. Paris: Jolly, 1667, I:5–6}}</ref> With the native population thus pacified, the English and French began to establish large sugar plantations which were worked by vast numbers of imported African slaves. This system created enormous wealth for the planter-colonists whilst also drastically changing the islands' demographics as black slaves soon came to outnumber Europeans by some margin.<ref name="thecommonwealth.org"/><ref name=Hubbard/>{{rp|26–31}}

A Spanish expedition of 1629 sent to enforce Spanish claims [[Battle of St. Kitts (1629)|destroyed the English and French colonies]] and deported the settlers back to their respective countries. As part of [[Anglo-Spanish War (1625-1630)|the war]] settlement in 1630, the Spanish permitted the re-establishment of the English and French colonies.<ref name=Hubbard/>{{rp|19–23}} Spain later formally recognised Britain's claim to St Kitts with the [[Treaty of Madrid (1670)]], in return for British cooperation in the fight against piracy.<ref name="SP 108/470">{{cite web|title=Treaty between Great Britain and Spain for the settlement of all disputes in America|url=http://discovery.nationalarchives.gov.uk/details/r/C3466433|website=The National Archives|publisher=gov.uk}}</ref>

As Spanish power went into decline, Saint Kitts became the premier base for English and French expansion into the wider Caribbean. From St. Kitts the British settled the islands of [[Antigua]], [[Montserrat]], [[Anguilla]] and [[Tortola]], and the French settled [[Martinique]], the [[Guadeloupe]] archipelago and [[Saint Barthélemy]]. During the late-17th century France and England fought for control over St Kitts and Nevis, fighting wars in [[Battle of Nevis|1667]],<ref name=Hubbard/>{{rp|41–50}} [[Nine Years' War#Asia and the Caribbean|1689–90]]<ref name=Hubbard/>{{rp|51–55}} and [[War of the Spanish Succession|1701–13]]. The French renounced their claim to the islands with the [[Treaty of Utrecht]] in 1713.<ref name=Hubbard/>{{rp|55–60}}<ref name="britannica.com"/> The islands' economy, already shattered by years of war, was further devastated by natural disasters: in 1690 an earthquake destroyed Jamestown, capital of Nevis, forcing the construction of a new capital at [[Charlestown, Nevis|Charlestown]]; further damage was caused by a hurricane in 1707.<ref name=Vincent>{{cite book|last1=Hubbard|first1=Vincent|title=Swords, Ships & Sugar|date=2002|publisher=Premiere Editions International, Inc.|location=Corvallis|isbn=9781891519055}}</ref>{{rp|105–108}}

===British colonial period===
The colony had recovered by the turn of the 18th century, and by the close of the 1700s St. Kitts had become the richest British Crown Colony per capita in the Caribbean as result of its slave-based [[sugar industry]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.beyondships3.com/st-kitts-history.html|title=St Kitts History|website=Beyondships Cruise Destinations}}</ref> The 18th century also saw Nevis, formerly the richer of the two islands, being eclipsed by St Kitts in economic importance.<ref name=Hubbard/>{{rp|75}}<ref name=Vincent/>{{rp|126,137}} [[Alexander Hamilton]] was born on Nevis in 1755 or 1757.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Chernow|first=Ron|url=https://archive.org/details/alexanderhamilto00cher/page/17/mode/2up|title=Alexander Hamilton|date=2004|publisher=Penguin Press|isbn=1-59420-009-2|location=New York|pages=17|oclc=53083988}}</ref>

[[File:BrimstoneHill01.jpg|thumb|right|The fortress on Brimstone Hill, focus of the successful French invasion of 1782]]
As Britain became embroiled in [[American Revolutionary War|war with its American colonies]], the French decided to use the opportunity to [[Siege of Brimstone Hill|re-capture St Kitts]] in 1782; however St Kitts was given back and recognised as British territory in the [[Treaty of Paris (1783)]].<ref name="britannica.com"/><ref name="thecommonwealth.org"/>

The African slave trade was terminated within the British Empire in 1807, and slavery outlawed completely in 1834. A four-year "apprenticeship" period followed for each slave, in which they worked for their former owners for wages. On Nevis 8,815 slaves were freed in this way, while St. Kitts had 19,780 freed.<ref name=Vincent/>{{rp|174}}<ref name=Hubbard/>{{rp|110,114–117}}

Saint Kitts and Nevis, along with Anguilla, were federated in 1882.

== Economy ==
{{main|Economy of Saint Kitts and Nevis}}

[[File:Basseterre from sea 2.JPG|thumb|The capital, [[Basseterre]]]]
Saint Kitts and Nevis is a twin-island federation whose economy is characterised by its dominant tourism, agriculture, and light manufacturing industries.<ref name="cia.gov"/> Sugar was the primary export from the 1940s on, but rising production costs, low world market prices, and the government's efforts to reduce dependence on it have led to a growing diversification of the agricultural sector. In 2005, the government decided to close down the state-owned sugar company, which had experienced losses and was a significant contributor to the fiscal deficit.<ref name="britannica.com"/><ref name="cia.gov"/>

St. Kitts and Nevis is heavily dependent upon tourism to drive its economy, a sector which has expanded significantly since the 1970s.<ref name="cia.gov"/><ref name="britannica.com"/> In 2009 there were 587,479 arrivals to Saint Kitts compared to 379,473 in 2007, an increase of just under 40% in a two-year period, however the tourist sector decreased during the [[Global financial crisis]] and has only recently returned to pre-crash levels.<ref name="cia.gov"/> In recent years the government has sought to diversify the economy via agriculture, tourism, export-oriented manufacturing, and offshore banking.<ref name="cia.gov"/>

In July 2015, St Kitts & Nevis and the [[Republic of Ireland]] signed a tax agreement to "promote international co-operation in tax matters through exchange of information." The agreement was developed by the OECD Global Forum Working Group on Effective Exchange of Information, which consisted of representatives from OECD member countries and 11 other countries in the Caribbean and other parts of the world.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ntltrust.com/news/2015/8/13/lorem-ipsum-dolor-sit-amet-consectetur-adipiscing-elit-2|title=St.Kitts-Nevis and the Republic of Ireland sign Tax Agreement|website=Ntltrust.com|access-date=30 August 2017}}</ref>

===Economic citizenship by investment===
{{see also|Saint Kitts and Nevis passport}}
St. Kitts allows [[Alien (law)|foreigners]] to obtain the status of St. Kitts citizen by means of a government sponsored investment programme called Citizenship-by-Investment.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ciu.gov.kn/ |title=Citizenship-by-Investment Introduction |access-date=17 June 2013}}</ref><ref name="cia.gov"/> Established in 1984, St. Kitts' citizenship programme is the oldest prevailing [[economic citizenship]] programme of this kind in the world. However, while the programme is the oldest in the world, it only catapulted in 2006 when [[Henley & Partners]], a global citizenship advisory firm, became involved in the restructuring of the programme to incorporate donations to the country's sugar industry.<ref>{{Cite book|title=The Cosmopolites: The Coming of the Global Citizen|last=Abrahamian|first=Atossa Araxia|publisher=Columbia Global Reports|isbn=978-0-9909763-6-3|year=2015}}</ref>

Citizenship-by-Investment Programmes have been criticised by some researchers due to the risks of corruption, money laundering and tax evasion.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Citizenship for Sale? In: The Oxford Handbook of Citizenship|author=Shachar, Ayelet |publisher=Oxford University Press|doi= 10.1093/oxfordhb/9780198805854.013.34|year=2017|pages= 789–816|s2cid=168914434 }}</ref> According to the official website of St. Kitts' Citizenship-by-Investment Programme they offer multiple benefits: "When you acquire citizenship under the St. Kitts & Nevis citizenship programme, you and your family enjoy full citizenship for life, which can be passed on to future generations by descent. As citizens of St. Kitts & Nevis, you and your family are issued with [[Saint Kitts and Nevis passport|passports]] which allow visa-free travel to [[Visa requirements for Saint Kitts and Nevis citizens|more than 140 countries]] and territories worldwide, including all of the EU. Of course you have the right to take up residence in St. Kitts & Nevis as well as in most of the [[CARICOM]] member countries at any time and for any length of time".<ref name=citizen>{{cite web|url=http://www.ciu.gov.kn/sites/ciu.gov.kn/files/CIU_Regulations.pdf |title=Saint Christopher & Nevis Citizen by Investment Regulations |website=Ciu.gov.kn |access-date=17 June 2013 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130816052757/http://ciu.gov.kn/sites/ciu.gov.kn/files/CIU_Regulations.pdf |archive-date=16 August 2013 }}</ref>

Each candidate must go through several legal steps and make a qualifying investment into the country<ref name=citizen /> and should complete certain legal requirements to qualify for citizenship under the investment programme. There is a minimum investment that has to be made by the applicant, in either an approved real estate or in the [[Sugar Industry Diversification Foundation]] (a public charity), to qualify for the economic citizenship of St. Kitts and Nevis.{{citation needed|date=July 2019}}<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.ciu.gov.kn/investment-options/|title=Investment Options {{!}} Government of St. Kitts & Nevis - Citizenship By Investment Program|language=en-US|access-date=2020-01-15}}</ref>

According to Henley & Partners, the requirements are as follows:<ref>{{Cite book|title=Global Residence and Citizenship Handbook|last=Kalin|first=Christian H.|publisher=Ideos Publications|year=2015|isbn=978-0992781859}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.henleyglobal.com/citizenship-saint-kitts-nevis-citizenship/|title=Citizenship Investment in St. Kitts and Nevis - Henley & Partners|website=Henleyglobal.com|access-date=20 July 2016}}</ref>
* An investment in designated real estate with a minimum value of US$400,000, plus the payment of government fees and other fees and taxes.
* A contribution to the Sugar Industry Diversification Fund of at least US$250,000, inclusive of all government fees but exclusive of due diligence fees which are the same for the real estate option.

According to Imperial & Legal, from 1 April 2018 St Kitts and Nevis government implemented a new investment option – Contribution to Sustainable Growth Fund (SGF). To qualify for citizenship of St Kitts & Nevis, applicants who choose to invest in SGF will need to make a one-off non-refundable contribution of $150,000 plus due diligence fees.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://imperiallegal.com/st-kitts-nevis-citizenship/|title=St Kitts & Nevis citizenship and passport by investment|website=Imperial & Legal|language=en-GB|access-date=21 August 2019}}</ref>

'''Jamaica''' ({{IPAc-en|audio=En-us-Jamaica.ogg|dʒ|ə|ˈ|m|eɪ|k|ə}}) is an [[island country]] situated in the [[Caribbean Sea]]. Spanning {{convert|10990|sqkm|sqmi}} in area, it is the third-largest island of the [[Greater Antilles]] and the [[Caribbean]] (after [[Cuba]] and [[Hispaniola]]).<ref name="CIA World Factbook – Jamaica">{{cite web |url=https://www.cia.gov/the-world-factbook/countries/jamaica/ |title=CIA World Factbook – Jamaica |access-date=29 July 2019 }}</ref> Jamaica lies about {{convert|145|km|mi}} south of Cuba, and {{convert|191|km|mi}} west of Hispaniola (the island containing the countries of [[Haiti]] and the [[Dominican Republic]]); the British Overseas Territory of the [[Cayman Islands]] lies some {{convert|215|km|mi}} to the north-west.

Originally inhabited by the indigenous [[Arawak]] and [[Taíno]] peoples, the island came under [[Spanish Empire|Spanish rule]] following the arrival of [[Christopher Columbus]] in 1494. Many of the indigenous people were either killed or died of diseases to which they had no immunity, and the Spanish then forcibly transplanted large numbers of African slaves to Jamaica as labourers.<ref name="CIA World Factbook – Jamaica"/> The island remained a possession of Spain until 1655, when England (later [[Kingdom of Great Britain|Great Britain]]) conquered it, renaming it ''Jamaica''. Under British colonial rule Jamaica became a leading sugar exporter, with a plantation economy dependent on the African slaves and later their descendants. The British fully emancipated all slaves in 1838, and many freedmen chose to have [[Subsistence agriculture|subsistence farms]] rather than to work on plantations. Beginning in the 1840s, the British began using Chinese and Indian [[Indenture|indentured]] labour to work on plantations. The island achieved independence from the United Kingdom on 6 August 1962.<ref name="CIA World Factbook – Jamaica"/>

With {{#expr:{{replace|{{UN_Population|Jamaica}}|,|}}/1e6 round 1}} million people,{{UN_Population|ref}} Jamaica is the third-most populous [[English-speaking world|Anglophone]] country in the [[Americas]] (after the [[United States]] and [[Canada]]), and the fourth-most populous country in the Caribbean. [[Kingston, Jamaica|Kingston]] is the country's capital and largest city. The majority of [[Jamaicans]] are of [[Sub-Saharan Africa]]n ancestry, with significant [[White Jamaicans|European]], [[East Asian people|East Asian]] (primarily [[Chinese Jamaicans|Chinese]]), [[Indo-Jamaicans|Indian]], [[Lebanese Jamaicans|Lebanese]], and mixed-race minorities.<ref name="CIA World Factbook – Jamaica"/> Due to a high rate of emigration for work since the 1960s, there is a large [[Jamaican diaspora]], particularly in Canada, the United Kingdom, and the United States. The country has a global influence that belies its small size; it was the birthplace of the [[Rastafari]] religion, [[reggae]] music (and associated genres such as [[Dub music|dub]], [[ska]] and [[dancehall]]), and it is internationally prominent in sports, most notably [[cricket]], [[Sprint (running)|sprinting]] and [[Sport of athletics|athletics]].<ref name="track">{{cite web |title=Athletics in Jamaica |url=http://www.my-island-jamaica.com/athletics_in_jamaica.html |publisher=My island Jamaica |access-date=11 October 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100818201042/http://www.my-island-jamaica.com/athletics_in_jamaica.html |archive-date=18 August 2010 |url-status=dead }}</ref><ref>"Reggae."

The English began taking an interest in the island and, following a failed attempt to conquer [[Santo Domingo]] on Hispaniola, [[William Penn (admiral)|Sir William Penn]] and General [[Robert Venables]] led an [[invasion of Jamaica]] in 1655.<ref>*{{cite book |last=Parker |first=Matthew |date=2011 |title=The Sugar Barons}}</ref> Battles at [[Battle of Ocho Rios|Ocho Rios in 1657]] and the [[Battle of Rio Nuevo|Rio Nuevo in 1658]] resulted in Spanish defeats; in 1660 the Maroon community under the leadership of [[Juan de Bolas]] switched sides from the Spanish, and began supporting the English.

Meanwhile, the Spanish made several attempts to re-capture the island, prompting the British to support pirates attacking Spanish ships in the Caribbean; as a result piracy became rampant on Jamaica, with the city of [[Port Royal]] becoming notorious for its lawlessness.

During the 1700s the economy boomed, based largely on sugar and other crops such as [[coffee]], [[cotton]] and [[indigo]]. All these crops were worked by black slaves, who lived short and often brutal lives with no rights, being the property of a small planter-class.<ref name="EBJH"/> In the 18th century, slaves ran away and joined the Maroons in increasing numbers, and resulted in The [[First Maroon War]] (1728 – 1739/40), which ended in stalemate. The British government sued for peace, and signed treaties with the Leeward Maroons led by [[Cudjoe]] and [[Accompong]] in 1739, and the Windward Maroons led by [[Quao]] and [[Queen Nanny]] in 1740.<ref>Bev Carey, ''The Maroon Story: The Authentic and Original History of the Maroons in the History of Jamaica 1490–1880'' (Kingston, Jamaica: Agouti Press, 1997), p. 315-355.</ref>

By the beginning of the 19th century, Jamaica's dependence on slave labour and a plantation economy had resulted in black people outnumbering white people by a ratio of almost 20 to 1. Although the British had outlawed the importation of slaves, some were still smuggled in from Spanish colonies and directly.{{citation needed|date=August 2019}} While planning the abolition of slavery, the British Parliament passed laws to improve conditions for slaves. They banned the use of whips in the field and flogging of women; informed planters that slaves were to be allowed religious instruction, and required a free day during each week when slaves could sell their produce,<ref>''History of the Catholic Church in Jamaica'' {{ISBN|978-0-829-40544-6}} p. 68</ref> prohibiting Sunday markets to enable slaves to attend church.{{citation needed|date=February 2016}} The House of Assembly in Jamaica resented and resisted the new laws. Members, with membership then restricted to European-Jamaicans, claimed that the slaves were content and objected to Parliament's interference in island affairs. Slave owners feared possible revolts if conditions were lightened.

Unemployment and poverty remained a problem for many Jamaicans. Various movements seeking political change arose as a result, most notably the [[Universal Negro Improvement Association and African Communities League]] founded by [[Marcus Garvey]] in 1917. As well as seeking greater political rights and an improvement for the condition of workers, Garvey was also a prominent [[Pan-Africanist]] and proponent of the [[Back-to-Africa movement]].<ref name=back>{{cite web|title=Historian situates 'back-to-Africa' movements in broad context|url=http://news.stanford.edu/news/2006/march1/colonize-030106.html|work=1 March 2006|publisher=Stanford.edu|access-date=24 August 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120729121919/http://news.stanford.edu/news/2006/march1/colonize-030106.html|archive-date=29 July 2012|url-status=live}}</ref> He was also one of the chief inspirations behind [[Rastafari]], a religion founded in Jamaica in the 1930s that combined Christianity with an [[Afrocentric]] theology focused on the figure of [[Haile Selassie]], Emperor of [[Ethiopia]].

===Post-independence era===
{{Main|Independence of Jamaica}}
Strong economic growth, averaging approximately 6% per annum, marked the first ten years of independence under conservative JLP governments; these were led by successive Prime Ministers [[Alexander Bustamante]], [[Donald Sangster]] (who died of natural causes within two months of taking office) and [[Hugh Shearer]].<ref name="EBJH"/> The growth was fuelled by high levels of private investment in [[bauxite]]/alumina, [[tourism]], the manufacturing industry and, to a lesser extent, the agricultural sector. In the [[1967 Jamaican general election]], the JLP were victorious again, winning 33 out of 53 seats, with the PNP taking 20 seats.<ref>Dieter Nohlen (2005) ''Elections in the Americas: A data handbook'', Volume I, p. 430.</ref>

In terms of foreign policy Jamaica became a member of the [[Non-Aligned Movement]], seeking to retain strong ties with Britain and the United States whilst also developing links with Communist states such as Cuba.<ref name="EBJH"/>

[[File:Michael Manley.jpg|thumb|right|Michael Manley, Prime Minister 1972–1980 and 1989–1992]]
The optimism of the first decade was accompanied by a growing sense of inequality among many Afro-Jamaicans, and a concern that the benefits of growth were not being shared by the urban poor, many of whom ended up living in crime-ridden shanty towns in Kingston.<ref name="EBJH"/> This, combined with the effects of a slowdown in the global economy in 1970,{{citation needed|date=March 2016}} led to the voters [[1972 Jamaican general election|electing the PNP]] under [[Michael Manley]] in 1972. The PNP won 37 seats to the JLP's 16.<ref>Dieter Nohlen (2005) ''Elections in the Americas: A data handbook'', Volume I, p. 430.</ref>

Manley's government enacted various social reforms, such as a higher [[minimum wage]], land reform, legislation for women's equality, greater housing construction and an increase in educational provision.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://michaelmanley.org/about/trade-unionist/ |title=Trade Unionist |first=Peter Scott Chrysalis |last=Communications |access-date=11 February 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180428093659/http://michaelmanley.org/about/trade-unionist/ |archive-date=28 April 2018 |url-status=live }}</ref><ref name="EBJH"/> Internationally he improved ties with the Communist bloc and vigorously opposed the [[apartheid]] regime in [[South Africa]].<ref name="EBJH"/> 

In 1976, the PNP won another landslide, winning 47 seats to the JLP's 13. The turnout was a very high 85 percent.<ref>Dieter Nohlen (2005) ''Elections in the Americas: A data handbook'', Volume I, p. 430.</ref> However, the economy faltered in this period due to a combination of internal and external factors (such as the oil shocks).<ref name="EBJH"/> The rivalry between the JLP and PNP became intense, and [[Jamaican political conflict|political and gang-related violence]] grew significantly in this period.<ref name="EBJH"/>

By 1980, Jamaica's gross national product had declined to some 25% below its 1972 level.{{citation needed|date=July 2019}} Seeking change, Jamaicans voted the JLP [[1980 Jamaican general election|back in]] in 1980 under [[Edward Seaga]], the JLP winning 51 seats to the PNP's nine seats.<ref>Dieter Nohlen (2005) ''Elections in the Americas: A data handbook'', Volume I, p. 430.</ref><ref name="EBJH"/> Firmly anti-Communist, Seaga cut ties with Cuba and sent troops to support the [[US invasion of Grenada]] in 1983.<ref name="EBJH"/> The economic deterioration, however, continued into the mid-1980s, exacerbated by a number of factors. The largest and third-largest alumina producers, [[Alpart]] and [[Alcoa]], closed; and there was a significant reduction in production by the second-largest producer, [[Alcan]].{{citation needed|date=July 2019}} Reynolds Jamaica Mines, Ltd. left the Jamaican industry. There was also a decline in tourism, which was important to the economy.{{citation needed|date=July 2019}} Owing to rising foreign and local debt, accompanied by large fiscal deficits, the government sought [[International Monetary Fund]] (IMF) financing, which was dependent on implementing various austerity measures.<ref name="EBJH"/> These resulted in strikes in 1985 and a decline in support for the Seaga government, exacerbated by criticism of the government's response to the devastation caused by [[Hurricane Gilbert]] in 1988.<ref name="EBJH"/><ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1988/11/27/magazine/showdown-in-jamaica.html|title=Showdown in Jamaica|date=27 November 1988|work=The New York Times|access-date=19 September 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160919230610/http://www.nytimes.com/1988/11/27/magazine/showdown-in-jamaica.html|archive-date=19 September 2016|url-status=live}}</ref> Having now de-emphasised socialism and adopting a more centrist position, Michael Manley and the PNP were [[1989 Jamaican general election|re-elected in 1989]], winning 45 seats to the JLP's 15.<ref>[[Dieter Nohlen|Nohlen, D]] (2005) ''Elections in the Americas: A data handbook, Volume I'', p430 {{ISBN|978-0-19-928357-6}}</ref><ref name="EBJH"/>

The PNP went on to win a string of elections, under Prime Ministers Michael Manley (1989–1992), [[P. J. Patterson]] (1992–2005) and [[Portia Simpson-Miller]] (2005–2007). In the [[1993 Jamaican general election]], Patterson led the PNP  to victory, winning 52 seats to the JLP's eight seats. Patterson also won the [[1997 Jamaican general election]], by another landslide margin of 50 seats to the JLP's 10 seats.<ref>Dieter Nohlen (2005) ''Elections in the Americas: A data handbook'', Volume I, p. 430.</ref> Patterson's third consecutive victory came in the [[2002 Jamaican general election]], when the PNP retained power, but with a reduced seat majority of 34 seats to 26. Patterson stepped down on 26 February 2006, and was replaced by [[Portia Simpson-Miller]], Jamaica's first female Prime Minister. The turnout slowly declined during this period of time, from 67.4% in 1993 to 59.1% in 2002.<ref>[[Dieter Nohlen|Nohlen, D]] (2005) ''Elections in the Americas: A data handbook, Volume I'', p430 {{ISBN|978-0-19-928357-6}}</ref>

During this period various economic reforms were introduced, such as deregulating the finance sector and floating the Jamaican dollar, as well as greater investment in infrastructure, whilst also retaining a strong social safety net.<ref name="EBJH"/> Political violence, so prevalent in the previous two decades, declined significantly.<ref name="EBJH"/><ref>Franklyn, Delano (ed.): 2002.

Independence, however widely celebrated in Jamaica, has been questioned in the early 21st century. In 2011, a survey showed that approximately 60% of Jamaicans believe that the country would have been better off had it remained a British colony, with only 17% believing it would have been worse off, citing as problems years of social and fiscal mismanagement in the country.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://jamaica-gleaner.com/gleaner/20110628/lead/lead1.html |title=Give Us The Queen! |date=28 June 2011 |work=The Gleaner |access-date=13 February 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120209064054/http://jamaica-gleaner.com/gleaner/20110628/lead/lead1.html |archive-date=9 February 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.ibtimes.com/most-jamaicans-would-prefer-remain-british-294753 |title=Most Jamaicans Would Prefer To Remain British |last=Ghosh |first=Palash |date=29 June 2011 |access-date=13 February 2017 |website=[[International Business Times]] |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170214102304/http://www.ibtimes.com/most-jamaicans-would-prefer-remain-british-294753 |archive-date=14 February 2017 |url-status=live }}</ref> However, this poll reflected a greater discontent with the JLP handling of crime and the economy, and as a result, Holness and the JLP were defeated in the [[2011 Jamaican general election]], which saw Portia Simpson-Miller and the PNP return to power. The number of seats had been increased to 63, and the PNP swept to power with a landslide 42 seats to the JLP's 21. The voter turnout was 53.17%.<ref>''Caribbean Elections: Jamaican Election Centre'', "Jamaican general election results 29 December 2011" http://www.caribbeanelections.com/jm/elections/jm_results_2011.asp Retrieved 24 December 2020.</ref>

Holness's JLP won the [[2016 Jamaican general election|2016]] general election narrowly, defeating Simpson-Miller's PNP, on 25 February. The PNP won 31 seats to the JLP's 32. As a result, Simpson-Miller became Opposition Leader for a second time. The voter turnout dipped below 50% for the first time, registering just 48.37%.<ref>''Caribbean Elections: Jamaican Election Centre'', "Jamaican general election results 25 February 2016" http://www.caribbeanelections.com/jm/elections/jm_results_2016.asp Retrieved 24 December 2020.</ref>

In the [[2020 Jamaican general election|2020 general election]], Andrew Holness made history for the JLP by accomplishing a second consecutive win for the Jamaica Labour Party, winning 49 seats to 14 won by the PNP, led this time by [[Peter Phillips (politician)]]. The last time a consecutive win occurred for the JLP was in 1980. However, the turnout at this election was just 37%, probably affected by the coronavirus pandemic.<ref>[http://jamaica-gleaner.com/article/news/20200903/javotes2020-jlp-trounces-pnp-49-14-seats JLP Trounces PNP 49 To 14 Seats] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200905085739/http://jamaica-gleaner.com/article/news/20200903/javotes2020-jlp-trounces-pnp-49-14-seats |date=5 September 2020 }} The Gleaner, 3 September 2020</ref>

Jamaica's current [[Constitution of Jamaica|constitution]] was drafted in 1962 by a bipartisan joint committee of the Jamaican legislature. It came into force with the Jamaica Independence Act, 1962 of the [[Parliament of the United Kingdom|United Kingdom parliament]], which gave Jamaica independence.<ref name="EBJ"/>

The [[Parliament of Jamaica]] is [[Bicameralism|bicameral]], consisting of the House of Representatives (Lower House) and the Senate (Upper House). Members of the House (known as Members of Parliament or ''MPs'') are directly elected, and the member of the House of Representatives who, in the governor-general's best judgement, is best able to command the confidence of a majority of the members of that House, is appointed by the governor-general to be the prime minister. Senators are nominated jointly by the prime minister and the parliamentary [[Opposition (parliamentary)|Leader of the Opposition]] and are then appointed by the governor-general.<ref name="EBJ"/>

The [[Judiciary of Jamaica]] operates on a [[common law]] system derived from [[English law]] and [[Commonwealth of Nations]] precedents.<ref name="EBJ"/> The court of final appeal is the [[Judicial Committee of the Privy Council]], though during the 2000s parliament attempted to replace it with the [[Caribbean Court of Justice]].{{citation needed|date=July 2019}}

===Political parties and elections===
Jamaica has traditionally had a [[two-party system]], with power often alternating between the [[People's National Party]] (PNP) and [[Jamaica Labour Party]] (JLP).<ref name="EBJ"/> The party with current administrative and legislative power is the Jamaica Labour Party, after its 2020 victory. There are also several minor parties who have yet to gain a seat in parliament; the largest of these is the [[National Democratic Movement (Jamaica)|National Democratic Movement]] (NDM).

===Administrative divisions===
{{main|Parishes of Jamaica}}

Jamaica is divided into 14 [[Parishes of Jamaica|parishes]], which are grouped into three historic [[Counties of Jamaica|counties]] that have no administrative relevance.<ref name="EBJ"/>

In the context of [[local government]] the parishes are designated "Local Authorities". These local authorities are further styled as "Municipal Corporations", which are either city municipalities or town municipalities.<ref name="localgovernemtn">{{cite web |title=Local Government Act, 2015 |url=http://www.localauthorities.gov.jm/sites/default/files/resources/local_governance_bill_2015.pdf |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160913220934/http://localauthorities.gov.jm/sites/default/files/resources/local_governance_bill_2015.pdf |url-status=dead |archive-date=13 September 2016 |website=localauthorities.gov.jm |access-date=17 January 2018}}</ref> Any new city municipality must have a population of at least 50,000, and a town municipality a number set by the Minister of Local Government.<ref name="localgovernemtn"/> There are currently no town municipalities.

The local governments of the parishes of Kingston and St. Andrews are consolidated as the city municipality of Kingston & St. Andrew Municipal Corporation. The newest city municipality created is the Municipality of Portmore in 2003. While it is geographically located within the parish of St. Catherine, it is governed independently.

[[File:FN FAL DA-SD-04-01067.jpg|thumb|right|Jamaican soldiers training to fire the [[FN FAL]] in 2002]]
The Jamaica Defence Force (JDF) is the small but professional military force of Jamaica.<ref name="CIA World Factbook – Jamaica"/> The JDF is based on the British military model with similar organisation, training, weapons and traditions. Once chosen, officer candidates are sent to one of several British or Canadian basic officer courses depending on the arm of service. Enlisted soldiers are given basic training at Up Park Camp or JDF Training Depot, Newcastle, both in St. Andrew. As with the British model, NCOs are given several levels of professional training as they rise up the ranks. Additional military schools are available for speciality training in Canada, the United States and the United Kingdom.{{citation needed|date=July 2019}}

The JDF is directly descended from the British Army's [[West India Regiment]] formed during the colonial era.<ref name="jdfhistory">{{cite web|title=Jamaica Defense Force History|url=http://www.jdfmil.org/overview/background/background2.php|publisher=Jamaica Defense Force|access-date=10 October 2010|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101025200223/http://www.jdfmil.org/overview/background/background2.php|archive-date=25 October 2010|url-status=dead}}</ref> The West India Regiment was used extensively by the British Empire in policing the empire from 1795 to 1926.

The West Indies Regiment was reformed in 1958 as part of the [[West Indies Federation]], after dissolution of the Federation the JDF was established.{{citation needed|date=July 2019}}

In recent years the JDF has been called on to assist the nation's police, the [[Jamaica Constabulary Force]] (JCF), in fighting drug smuggling and a rising crime rate which includes one of the highest murder rates in the world. JDF units actively conduct armed patrols with the JCF in high-crime areas and known gang neighbourhoods. There has been vocal controversy as well as support of this JDF role. In early 2005, an Opposition leader, [[Edward Seaga]], called for the merger of the JDF and JCF. This has not garnered support in either organisation nor among the majority of citizens.{{citation needed|date=July 2019}} In 2017, Jamaica signed the UN [[treaty on the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons]].<ref>{{cite web |url=https://treaties.un.org/Pages/ViewDetails.aspx?src=TREATY&mtdsg_no=XXVI-9&chapter=26&clang=_en |title=Chapter XXVI: Disarmament&nbsp;– No. 9 Treaty on the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons |publisher=United Nations Treaty Collection |date=7 July 2017 |access-date=16 August 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190806220546/https://treaties.un.org/Pages/ViewDetails.aspx?src=TREATY&mtdsg_no=XXVI-9&chapter=26&clang=_en |archive-date=6 August 2019 |url-status=live }}</ref>

Among the variety of terrestrial, aquatic and marine ecosystems are dry and wet limestone forests, rainforest, riparian woodland, wetlands, caves, rivers, seagrass beds and coral reefs. The authorities have recognised the tremendous significance and potential of the environment and have designated some of the more 'fertile' areas as 'protected'. Among the island's protected areas are the [[Cockpit Country]], [[Jamaican dry forests|Hellshire Hills]], and Litchfield forest reserves. In 1992, Jamaica's first marine park, covering nearly {{convert|15|km2|sqmi}}, was established in [[Montego Bay]]. [[Portland Bight Protected Area]] was designated in 1999.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.unesco.org/csi/act/jamaica/jamai2.htm |title=CSI Activities (Portland Bight, Jamaica) |publisher=Unesco.org |access-date=20 October 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130309111105/http://www.unesco.org/csi/act/jamaica/jamai2.htm |archive-date=9 March 2013 |url-status=live }}</ref> The following year [[Blue and John Crow Mountains National Park]] was created, covering roughly {{convert|300|mi2|km2}} of a wilderness area which supports thousands of tree and fern species and rare animals.

Jamaica's climate is tropical, supporting diverse ecosystems with a wealth of plants and animals. Its plant life has changed considerably over the centuries; when the Spanish arrived in 1494, except for small agricultural clearings, the country was deeply forested. The European settlers cut down the great timber trees for building and ships' supplies, and cleared the plains, savannas, and mountain slopes for intense agricultural cultivation.<ref name="EBJ"/> Many new plants were introduced including sugarcane, bananas, and citrus trees.<ref name="EBJ"/>

Jamaica is home to about 3,000 species of [[flowering plant|native flowering plants]] (of which over 1,000 are [[endemism|endemic]] and 200 are species of [[Orchidaceae|orchid]]), thousands of species of non-flowering flora, and about 20 [[botanical garden]]s, some of which are several hundred years old.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://old.jamaica-gleaner.com/pages/history/story0021.html |title=Jamaica's Botantical{{sic|hide=y}} Gardens Worth More Than Gold |author=<!--Not stated--> |website=Jamaica Gleaner |publisher=Jamaica Gleaner Newspaper |access-date=23 January 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190130103325/http://old.jamaica-gleaner.com/pages/history/story0021.html |archive-date=30 January 2019 |url-status=live }}</ref><ref>{{cite news |last=Aiken, Wilson, Vogel, Garraway PhD |first=Karl, Byron, Peter, Eric |date=21 January 2007 |title=LETTER OF THE DAY: Biologists speak on Cockpit mining |url=https://www.mona.uwi.edu/lifesciences/cockpit.htm |work=University of the West Indies |location=University of the West Indies, Mona, Jamaica |access-date=23 January 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100712155740/http://www.mona.uwi.edu/lifesciences/cockpit.htm |archive-date=12 July 2010 |url-status=live }}</ref> Areas of heavy rainfall also contain stands of bamboo, ferns, ebony, mahogany, and rosewood.

Jamaican's fauna, typical of the [[Caribbean]], includes highly diversified wildlife with many endemic species. As with other oceanic islands, land mammals are mostly several species of [[bat]]s of which at least three endemic species are found only in [[Cockpit Country]], one of which is at-risk. Other species of bat include the [[Jamaican fig-eating bat|fig-eating]] and [[lasiurus|hairy-tailed bats]].

However, the marine life in Jamaica is also being affected. There could be many factors that contribute to marine life not having the best health.

The ocean connects all the countries all over the world, however, everyone and everything is affecting the flow and life in the ocean. Jamaica is a very touristy place specifically because of their beaches. If their oceans are not functioning at their best then the well-being of Jamaica and the people who live there will start to deteriorate. According to the OECD, oceans contribute $1.5 trillion annually in value-added to the overall economy.<ref name=":12">{{cite web|url=http://www.worldbank.org/en/topic/environment/brief/oceans|title=Oceans, Fisheries and Coastal Economies|website=World Bank|access-date=2018-12-16|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181225030929/http://www.worldbank.org/en/topic/environment/brief/oceans|archive-date=25 December 2018|url-status=live}}</ref> A developing country on an island will get the majority of their revenue from their ocean.

=== Pollution ===
Pollution comes from run-off, sewage systems, and garbage. However, this typically all ends up in the ocean after there is rain or floods. Everything that ends up in the water changes the quality and balance of the ocean. Poor coastal water quality has adversely affected fisheries, tourism and mariculture, as well as undermining biological sustainability of the living resources of ocean and coastal habitats.<ref name=":22" /> Jamaica imports and exports many goods through their waters. Some of the imports that go into Jamaica include petroleum and petroleum products. Issues include accidents at sea; risk of spills through local and international transport of petroleum and petroleum products.<ref name=":22" /> Oil spills can disrupt the marine life with chemicals that are not normally found in the ocean. Other forms of pollution also occur in Jamaica. Solid waste disposal mechanisms in Jamaica are currently inadequate.<ref name=":22" /> The solid waste gets into the water through rainfall forces. Solid waste is also harmful to wildlife, particularly birds, fish and turtles that feed at the surface of the water and mistake floating debris for food.<ref name=":22" /> For example, plastic can be caught around birds and turtles necks making it difficult to eat and breath as they begin to grow causing the plastic to get tighter around their necks. Pieces of plastic, metal, and glass can be mistaken for the food fish eat. Each Jamaican generates 1&nbsp;kg (2&nbsp;lbs) of waste per day; only 70% of this is collected by National Solid Waste Management Authority (NSWMA) — the remaining 30% is either burnt or disposed of in gullies/waterways.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.un.org/Depts/los/consultative_process/documents/6_davis.pdf |title=MARINE DEBRIS: JAMAICA'S RESPONSE |date=6–10 June 2005 |website=www.un.org |access-date=2018-12-16 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200107223159/https://www.un.org/Depts/los/consultative_process/documents/6_davis.pdf |archive-date=7 January 2020 |url-status=live }}</ref>

=== Environmental policies ===
There are policies that are being put into place to help preserve the ocean and the life below water. The goal of integrated coastal zone management (ICZM) is to improve the quality of life of human communities who depend on coastal resources while maintaining the biological diversity and productivity of coastal ecosystems.<ref name=":22" /> Developing an underdeveloped country can impact the oceans ecosystem because of all the construction that would be done to develop the country. Over-building, driven by powerful market forces as well as poverty among some sectors of the population, and destructive exploitation contribute to the decline of ocean and coastal resources.<ref name=":22" /> Developing practices that will contribute to the lives of the people but also to the life of the ocean and its ecosystem. Some of these practices include: Develop sustainable fisheries practices, ensure sustainable mariculture techniques and practices, sustainable management of shipping, and promote [[sustainable tourism]] practices.<ref name=":22" /> As for tourism, tourism is the number one source of foreign exchange earnings in Jamaica and, as such is vital to the national economy.<ref name=":22" /> Tourist typically go to countries unaware of issues and how they impact those issues. Tourist are not going to be used to living in a different style compared to their own country. Practices such as: provide sewage treatment facilities for all tourist areas, determine carrying capacity of the environment prior to planning tourism activities, provide alternative types of tourist activities can help to get desired results such as the development of alternative tourism which will reduce the current pressure on resources that support traditional tourism activities.<ref name=":22" /> A study was conducted to see how tourist could help with sustainable financing for ocean and coastal management in Jamaica. Instead of using tourist fees they would call them environmental fees. This study aims to inform the relevant stakeholders of the feasibility of implementing environmental fees as well as the likely impact of such revenue generating instruments on the current tourist visitation rates to the island.<ref name=":03" /> The development of a user fee system would help fund environmental management and protection. The results show that tourists have a high consumer surplus associated with a vacation in Jamaica, and have a significantly lower willingness to pay for a tourism tax when compared to an environmental tax. The findings of the study show that the "label" of the tax and as well as the respondent's awareness of the institutional mechanisms for environmental protection and tourism are important to their decision framework.<ref name=":03" /> Tourist are more willing to pay for environmental fees rather than tourist tax fees. A tax high enough to fund for environmental management and protection but low enough to continue to bring tourist to Jamaica. It has been shows that if an environmental tax of $1 per person were introduced it would not cause a significant decline in visitation rates and would generate revenues of US$1.7M.<ref name=":03" />

Eventually their descendants became very successful politicians and businessmen. Notable Jamaicans from this group include former Jamaican Prime Minister [[Edward Seaga]], Jamaican politician and former Miss World [[Lisa Hanna]], Jamaican politicians [[Edward Zacca]] and [[Shahine Robinson]], and hotelier [[Abraham Elias Issa]].

In 1835, [[Charles Ellis, 1st Baron Seaford]] gave 500 acres of his 10,000 acre estate in Westmoreland for the Seaford Town German settlement. Today most of the town's descendants are of full or partial German descent.<ref name="auto"/>

The first wave of [[English people|English]] immigrants arrived to the island 1655 after conquering the Spanish, and they have historically been the dominant group. Prominent descendants from this group include former [[Americans|American]] Governor of New York [[David Paterson]], Sandals Hotels owner [[Gordon "Butch" Stewart|Gordon Butch Stewart]], United States [[Senior Advisor to the President of the United States|Presidential Advisor]] and "mother" of the Pell Grant [[Lois Rice]], and former [[National Security Advisor (United States)|United States National Security Advisor]] and Ambassador to the United Nations [[Susan Rice]]. The first Irish immigrants came to Jamaica in the 1600s as war prisoners and later, indentured labour. Their descendants include two of [[Order of National Hero (Jamaica)|Jamaica's National Heroes]]:  Prime Ministers [[Michael Manley]] and [[Alexander Bustamante]]. Along with the [[English people|English]] and the [[Irish people|Irish]], the [[Scottish people|Scots]] are another group that has made a significant impact on the island. According to the [[The Herald (Glasgow)|Scotland Herald newspaper]], Jamaica has more people using the Campbell surnames than the population of [[Scotland]] itself, and it also has the highest percentage of Scottish surnames outside of Scotland. Scottish surnames account to about 60% of the surnames in the Jamaican phone books.{{citation needed|date=July 2019}} The first Jamaican inhabitants from Scotland were exiled "rebels". Later, they would be followed by ambitious businessmen who spent time between their great country estates in Scotland and the island. As a result, many of the slave owning plantations on the island were owned by Scottish men, and thus a large number of mixed-race Jamaicans can claim Scottish ancestry. High immigration from Scotland continued until well after independence.{{citation needed|date=July 2019}} Today, notable Scottish-Jamaicans include the businessman John Pringle, former American Secretary of State [[Colin Powell]], and American actress [[Kerry Washington]].<ref>{{cite news |last=Leask |first=David |date=10 October 2005 |title=Jamaica: the country with more Campbells per head of population than Scotland |url=https://www.heraldscotland.com/opinion/13839601.jamaica-the-country-with-more-campbells-per-head-of-population-than-scotland/ |work=Herald Scotland |access-date=28 January 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190129010219/https://www.heraldscotland.com/opinion/13839601.jamaica-the-country-with-more-campbells-per-head-of-population-than-scotland/ |archive-date=29 January 2019 |url-status=live }}</ref>

===Music===
{{Main|Music of Jamaica}}
Though a small nation, Jamaican culture has a strong global presence. The musical genres [[reggae]], [[ska]], [[mento]], [[rocksteady]], [[Dub music|dub]], and, more recently, [[dancehall]] and [[ragga]] all originated in the island's vibrant, popular urban recording industry.<ref>Dave Thompson (2002) ''Reggae and Caribbean Music''. Backbeat Books. p. 261. {{ISBN|0879306556}}.</ref> These have themselves gone on to influence numerous other genres, such as [[punk rock]] (through reggae and ska), [[dub poetry]], [[New wave music|New Wave]], [[2 Tone (music genre)|two-tone]], [[reggaeton]], [[Oldschool jungle|jungle]], [[drum and bass]], [[dubstep]], [[Grime (music genre)|grime]] and American [[Hip hop music|rap]] music. Some rappers, such as [[The Notorious B.I.G.]], [[Busta Rhymes]], and [[Heavy D]], are of Jamaican descent.

[[Bob Marley]] is probably the best known Jamaican musician; with his band [[The Wailers]] he had a string of hits in 1960s–70s, popularising reggae internationally and going on to sell millions of records.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.biography.com/news/bob-marley-biography-facts |title=7 Fascinating Facts About Bob Marley |access-date=10 October 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171010155428/https://www.biography.com/news/bob-marley-biography-facts |archive-date=10 October 2017 |url-status=live }}</ref><ref name="Toynbee2013">{{cite book |first=Jason |last=Toynbee |title=Bob Marley: Herald of a Postcolonial World |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=BkDohE6Qd3oC&pg=PA1969 |access-date=23 August 2013 |date=8 May 2013 |publisher=John Wiley & Sons |isbn=978-0-7456-5737-0 |pages=1969– |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131012235034/http://books.google.com/books?id=BkDohE6Qd3oC&pg=PA1969 |archive-date=12 October 2013 |url-status=live }}</ref> Many other internationally known artists were born in Jamaica, including [[Toots Hibbert]], [[Millie Small]], [[Lee "Scratch" Perry]], [[Gregory Isaacs]], [[Half Pint]], [[Protoje]], [[Peter Tosh]], [[Bunny Wailer]], [[Big Youth]], [[Jimmy Cliff]], [[Dennis Brown]], [[Desmond Dekker]], [[Beres Hammond]], [[Beenie Man]], [[Shaggy (musician)|Shaggy]], [[Grace Jones]], [[Shabba Ranks]], [[Super Cat]], [[Buju Banton]], [[Sean Paul]], [[I Wayne]], [[Bounty Killer]] and many others.

===Literature===
{{Main|Jamaican literature}}

The journalist and author [[H. G. de Lisser]] (1878–1944) used his native country as the setting for his many novels.<ref name=Hughes>Michael Hughes, "De Lisser, Herbert G.", ''A Companion to West Indian Literature'', Collins, 1979, pp. 40–42.</ref> Born in [[Falmouth, Jamaica]], de Lisser worked as a reporter for the ''[[Jamaica Times]]'' at a young age and in 1920 began publishing the magazine ''[[Planters' Punch]]''. ''The White Witch of Rosehall'' is one of his better-known novels. He was named Honorary President of the Jamaican Press Association; he worked throughout his professional career to promote the Jamaican sugar industry.

[[Roger Mais]] (1905 – 1955), a journalist, poet, and playwright wrote many short stories, plays, and novels, including ''The Hills Were Joyful Together'' (1953), ''Brother Man'' (1954), and ''Black Lightning'' (1955).<ref name="Hawthorne 7">Hawthorne, Evelyn J. "The Writer and the Nationalist Model", ''Roger Mais and the Decolonization of Caribbean Culture'', NY: Peter Lang, 1989, p. 7.</ref>

[[Ian Fleming]] (1908 – 1964), who had a home in Jamaica where he spent considerable time, repeatedly used the island as a setting in his [[James Bond]] novels, including ''[[Live and Let Die (novel)|Live and Let Die]]'', ''[[Dr. No (novel)|Doctor No]]'', "[[For Your Eyes Only (short story)|For Your Eyes Only]]", ''[[The Man with the Golden Gun (novel)|The Man with the Golden Gun]]'', and ''[[Octopussy and The Living Daylights]]''.<ref>{{cite web|title=Ian Fleming International Airport opened in Jamaica!|url=http://www.ianfleming.com/pages/news/index.asp?NewsID=128|work=News & Press|publisher=[[Ian Fleming Publications]]|access-date=14 December 2011|date=17 January 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120722035913/http://www.ianfleming.com/pages/news/index.asp?NewsID=128|archive-date=22 July 2012}}</ref> In addition, James Bond uses a Jamaica-based cover in ''[[Casino Royale (novel)|Casino Royale]]''. So far, the only James Bond film adaptation to have been set in Jamaica is ''[[Dr. No (film)|Doctor No]]''. Filming for the fictional island of [[James Bond locations#Locations depicted in films|San Monique]] in ''[[Live and Let Die (film)|Live and Let Die]]'' took place in Jamaica.

[[Marlon James (novelist)|Marlon James]] (1970), novelist has published three novels: ''John Crow's Devil'' (2005), ''[[The Book of Night Women]]'' (2009) and ''[[A Brief History of Seven Killings]]'' (2014), winner of the 2015 [[Man Booker Prize]].<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2015/03/15/magazine/from-jamaica-to-minnesota-to-myself.html|title=From Jamaica to Minnesota to Myself|last=James|first=Marlon|work=[[The New York Times]]|date=10 March 2015|access-date=27 June 2018|language=en|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190731160335/https://www.nytimes.com/2015/03/15/magazine/from-jamaica-to-minnesota-to-myself.html|archive-date=31 July 2019|url-status=live}}</ref>

[[File:Usain Bolt after 200 m final Beijing 2015.jpg|180px|thumb|[[Usain Bolt]] is one of the most prominent sprinters in the world]]
Since independence Jamaica has consistently produced world class athletes in track and field.<ref name=track /> In Jamaica involvement in athletics begins at a very young age and most high schools maintain rigorous athletics programs with their top athletes competing in national competitions (most notably the VMBS Girls and Boys Athletics Championships) and international meets (most notably the [[Penn Relays]]). In Jamaica it is not uncommon for young athletes to attain press coverage and national fame long before they arrive on the international athletics stage.

Over the past six decades Jamaica has produced dozens of world class sprinters including Olympic and World Champion [[Usain Bolt]], world record holder in the 100m for men at 9.58s, and 200m for men at 19.19s. Other noteworthy Jamaican sprinters include [[Arthur Wint]], the first Jamaican Olympic gold medalist; [[Donald Quarrie]], [[Elaine Thompson]] double Olympic champion from Rio 2016 in the 100m and 200m, Olympic Champion and former 200m world record holder; [[Roy Anthony Bridge]], part of the International Olympic Committee; [[Merlene Ottey]]; [[Delloreen Ennis-London]]; [[Shelly-Ann Fraser|Shelly-Ann Fraser-Pryce]], the former World and two time Olympic 100m Champion; [[Kerron Stewart]]; [[Aleen Bailey]]; [[Juliet Cuthbert]]; three-time Olympic gold medalist; [[Veronica Campbell-Brown]]; [[Sherone Simpson]]; [[Brigitte Foster-Hylton]]; [[Yohan Blake]]; [[Herb McKenley]]; [[George Rhoden]], Olympic gold medalist; [[Deon Hemmings]], Olympic gold medalist; as well as [[Asafa Powell]], former 100m world record holder and 2x 100m Olympic finalist and gold medal winner in the men's 2008 Olympic 4 × 100 m. American Olympic winner [[Sanya Richards-Ross]] was also born in Jamaica.

Jamaica has also produced several world class amateur and professional boxers including [[Trevor Berbick]] and [[Mike McCallum]]. First-generation Jamaican athletes have continued to make a significant impact on the sport internationally, especially in the United Kingdom where the list of top British boxers born in Jamaica or of Jamaican parents includes [[Lloyd Honeyghan]], [[Chris Eubank]], [[Audley Harrison]], [[David Haye]], [[Lennox Lewis]] and [[Frank Bruno]], [[Donovan Ruddock|Donovan "Razor" Ruddock]], [[Mike Tyson]], and [[Floyd Mayweather Jr.]], whose maternal grandfather is Jamaican.<ref>{{YouTube|gEAIWUxecvk|Floyd Mayweather is a Jamaican Yardie (big tings)}}</ref>

[[Association football]] and [[horse-racing]] are other popular sports in Jamaica. The [[Jamaica National Football Team|national football team]] qualified for the 1998 [[FIFA World Cup]]. Horse racing was Jamaica's first sport. It was brought in the 1700s by British immigrants to satisfy their longing for their favorite pastime back at home. During slavery, the Afro-Jamaican slaves were considered the best horse jockeys. Today, horse racing provides jobs for about 20,000 people including horse breeders, groomers, and trainers. Also, several Jamaicans are known internationally for their success in horse racing including Richard DePass, who once held the Guinness Book of World Records for the most wins in a day, Canadian awards winner George HoSang, and American award winners Charlie Hussey, Andrew Ramgeet, and Barrington Harvey. Also, there are hundreds of Jamaicans who are employed in the United States, Canada, and the United Kingdom as exercise riders and groomers.<ref>{{cite news |last=Tortello |first=Dr. Rebecca |title=Jamaican Horse racing History: The sport of kings |url=http://old.jamaica-gleaner.com/pages/history/story0078.html |work=Jamaica Gleaner |location=Jamaica |access-date=22 January 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190207044649/http://old.jamaica-gleaner.com/pages/history/story0078.html |archive-date=7 February 2019 |url-status=live }}</ref>

==Education==
{{Main|Education in Jamaica}}

The emancipation of the slaves heralded the establishment of an education system for the masses. Prior to emancipation there were few schools for educating locals and many sent their children off to England to access quality education.{{citation needed|date=July 2019}} After emancipation the West Indian Commission granted a sum of money to establish Elementary Schools, now known as ''All Age Schools''. Most of these schools were established by the churches.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.jis.gov.jm/education/html/20041212T090000-0500_4438_JIS_MORAVIAN_CHURCH_CONTRIBUTING_MUCH_TO_EDUCATION.asp |title=Moravian Church Contribution to Education in Jamaica |access-date=22 December 2007 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071123064227/http://www.jis.gov.jm/education/html/20041212T090000-0500_4438_JIS_MORAVIAN_CHURCH_CONTRIBUTING_MUCH_TO_EDUCATION.asp |archive-date=23 November 2007}}</ref> This was the genesis of the modern Jamaican school system.

Presently the following categories of schools exist:
* '''Early childhood''' – Basic, infant and privately operated pre-school. Age cohort: 2 – 5 years.
* '''Primary''' – Publicly and privately owned (privately owned being called preparatory schools). Ages 3 – 12 years.
* '''Secondary''' – Publicly and privately owned. Ages 10 – 19 years. The high schools in Jamaica may be either single-sex or co-educational institutions, and many schools follow the traditional [[Sixth form|English grammar school model]] used throughout the British West Indies.
* '''Tertiary''' – Community colleges; teachers' colleges, with the Mico Teachers' College (now The MICO University College) being the oldest, founded in 1836; the Shortwood Teachers' College (which was once an all-female teacher training institution); vocational training centres, colleges and universities, publicly and privately owned. There are five local universities: the [[University of the West Indies]] (Mona Campus); the [[University of Technology, Jamaica]], formerly The College of Art Science and Technology (CAST); the [[Northern Caribbean University]], formerly West Indies College; the [[University of the Commonwealth Caribbean]], formerly the University College of The Caribbean; and the [[International University of the Caribbean]].
Additionally, there are many community and teacher training colleges.

Education is free from the early childhood to secondary levels. There are also opportunities for those who cannot afford further education in the vocational arena, through the Human Employment and Resource Training-National Training Agency (HEART Trust-NTA) programme,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.moec.gov.jm/news/speeches/ict2003.htm |title=Transforming the Jamaican Education System |access-date=22 December 2007 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080520221921/http://www.moec.gov.jm/news/speeches/ict2003.htm |archive-date=20 May 2008 |url-status=dead}}</ref> which is opened to all working age national population<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.unevoc.unesco.org/worldtvetdatabase1.php?ct=JAM | title=Vocational Education in Jamaica | publisher=UNESCO-UNEVOC | date=August 2012 | access-date=26 May 2014 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140528010330/http://www.unevoc.unesco.org/worldtvetdatabase1.php?ct=JAM | archive-date=28 May 2014 | url-status=dead }}</ref> and through an extensive scholarship network for the various universities.

Students are taught Spanish in school from the primary level upwards; about 40–45% of educated people in Jamaica knows some form of Spanish.{{citation needed|date=May 2019}}

==Infrastructure==

===Transport===
{{further|Transport in Jamaica}}
[[File:Halfway Tree Transport Center, Kingston, Jamaica.jpg|thumb|Halfway Tree Transport Center, Kingston]]
The [[transportation|transport]] infrastructure in Jamaica consists of [[roadway]]s, [[railway]]s and [[Aviation|air transport]], with roadways forming the backbone of the island's internal transport system.<ref name="EBJ"/>

====Roadways====
{{main|Roads in Jamaica}}

The Jamaican road network consists of almost {{convert|21000|km|mi}} of roads, of which over {{convert|15000|km|mi}} is paved.<ref name=WorldFactbook>[https://www.cia.gov/the-world-factbook/countries/jamaica/ The CIA World Factbook – Jamaica] . Retrieved 2015-09-16.</ref> The [[Government of Jamaica|Jamaican Government]] has, since the late 1990s and in cooperation with private investors, embarked on a campaign of infrastructural improvement projects, one of which includes the creation of a system of [[freeway]]s, the first such access-controlled roadways of their kind on the island, connecting the main population centres of the island. This project has so far seen the completion of {{convert|33|km|mi}} of freeway.{{citation needed|date=July 2019}}

====Railways====
{{main|Railways of Jamaica}}

Railways in Jamaica no longer enjoy the prominent position they once did, having been largely replaced by roadways as the primary means of transport. Of the {{convert|272|km|mi}} of railway found in Jamaica, only {{convert|57|km|mi}} remain in operation, currently used to transport [[bauxite]].<ref name=WorldFactbook/> On 13 April 2011, a limited passenger service was resumed between May Pen, Spanish Town and Linstead.{{citation needed|date=July 2019}}

====Air transport====
[[File:Montego Bay plane Photo D Ramey Logan.jpg|thumb|right|A [[US Airways]] aircraft landing at Montego Bay (2013)]]
[[File:Norman Manley International Airport.jpg|thumb|Norman Manley International Airport]]
There are three international airports in Jamaica with modern [[airport terminal|terminals]], long [[runway]]s, and the navigational equipment required to accommodate the large [[jet aircraft]] used in modern and [[air travel]]: [[Norman Manley International Airport]] in [[Kingston, Jamaica|Kingston]]; [[Ian Fleming International Airport]] in [[Boscobel, Jamaica|Boscobel]], [[Saint Mary Parish, Jamaica|Saint Mary Parish]]; and the island's largest and busiest airport, [[Sir Donald Sangster International Airport]] in the [[resort]] city of [[Montego Bay]]. Manley and Sangster International airports are home to the country's national airline, [[Air Jamaica]]. In addition there are local commuter airports at [[Tinson Pen Aerodrome|Tinson Pen (Kingston)]], [[Port Antonio]], and [[Negril]], which cater to internal flights only. Many other small, rural centres are served by private airstrips on sugar estates or bauxite mines.<ref name="EBJ"/>

====Ports, shipping and lighthouses====
{{see also|Lighthouses in Jamaica}}

Owing to its location in the Caribbean Sea in the [[sea lane|shipping lane]] to the [[Panama Canal]] and relative proximity to large markets in North America and [[emerging market]]s in Latin America, Jamaica receives much traffic of [[Containerization|shipping containers]]. The [[container terminal]] at the Port of Kingston has undergone large expansion in capacity in recent years to handle growth both already realised as well as that which is projected in coming years.<ref name=nameJamaicaObserver>[http://www.jamaicaobserver.com/news/html/20051117T220000-0500_92733_OBS_PORT_AUTHORITY__MAERSK_IN_MAJOR_DEAL.asp The Jamaica Observer] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070926232147/http://www.jamaicaobserver.com/news/html/20051117T220000-0500_92733_OBS_PORT_AUTHORITY__MAERSK_IN_MAJOR_DEAL.asp |date=26 September 2007}}. Retrieved 27 June 2007.</ref> Montego Freeport in [[Montego Bay]] also handles a variety of cargo like (though more limited than) the Port of Kingston, mainly agricultural products.

There are several other ports positioned around the island, including Port Esquivel in [[Saint Catherine Parish, Jamaica|St. Catherine]] ([[WINDALCO]]), Rocky Point in [[Clarendon Parish, Jamaica|Clarendon]], Port Kaiser in [[Saint Elizabeth Parish, Jamaica|St. Elizabeth]], Port Rhoades in Discovery Bay, Reynolds Pier in [[Ocho Rios]], and Boundbrook Port in [[Port Antonio]].

To aid the navigation of shipping, Jamaica operates nine lighthouses.<ref name="ATSR">[http://www.mtw.gov.jm/general_information/reports/TransportStatisticsReport2003_2004.pdf Annual Transport Statistics Report: Jamaica in Figures 2003-2004] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130315174612/http://www.mtw.gov.jm/general_information/reports/TransportStatisticsReport2003_2004.pdf |date=2013-03-15}}, Ministry of Transport and Works, July 2005.</ref> They are maintained by the [http://www.portjam.com/ Port Authority of Jamaica], an agency of the [http://www.mtw.gov.jm/ Ministry of Transport and Works].<ref name="ATSR"/>

===Energy===
{{see also|Solar power in Jamaica}}

Jamaica depends on petroleum imports to satisfy its national energy needs.<ref name=WorldFactbook/> Many test sites have been explored for oil, but no commercially viable quantities have been found.<ref name="pcj.com">{{cite web |url=http://www.pcj.com/industry_stat.htm |archive-url=https://archive.today/20010203232100/http://www.pcj.com/industry_stat.htm |url-status=dead |archive-date=3 February 2001 |title=Petroleum Corp of Jamaica, Petroleum Industry Statistics |access-date=21 July 2007}}</ref> The most convenient sources of imported oil and motor fuels (diesel, gasoline, and jet fuel) are from [[Mexico]] and [[Venezuela]].

Jamaica's electrical power is produced by diesel ([[Bunker fuel|bunker oil]]) generators located in [[Old Harbour, Jamaica|Old Harbour]]. This facility has been further equipped with liquid natural gas capability and storage.  Other smaller power stations (most owned by the Jamaica Public Service Company,<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.myjpsco.com/ |title=Jamaica Public Service Company |access-date=1 January 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110107125651/http://www.myjpsco.com/ |archive-date=7 January 2011 |url-status=dead }}</ref> the island's electricity provider) support the island's electrical grid including the Hunts Bay Power Station, the Bogue Power Station [[Saint James Parish, Jamaica|Saint James]], the Rockfort Power Station [[Saint Andrew Parish, Jamaica|Saint Andrew]] and small hydroelectric plants on the White River, Rio Bueno, Morant River, Black River (Maggotty) and Roaring River.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.myjpsco.com/about_us/power_plants.php |title=JPS – JPS' Power Plants |access-date=1 January 2011 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101202075147/http://www.myjpsco.com/about_us/power_plants.php |archive-date=2 December 2010}}</ref> A wind farm, owned by the Petroleum Corporation of Jamaica, was established at Wigton, [[Manchester Parish|Manchester]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.wwfja.com |title=Wigton Wind Farm Company |access-date=25 March 2008 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080417201155/http://www.wwfja.com/ |archive-date=17 April 2008 |url-status=dead }}</ref>

Jamaica has successfully operated a [[SLOWPOKE reactor|SLOWPOKE-2 nuclear reactor]] of 20&nbsp;kW capacity since the early 1980s, but there are no plans to expand nuclear power at present.<ref>[[List of nuclear reactors#Jamaica]]</ref>

Jamaica imports approximately {{convert|80000|oilbbl}} of oil energy products per day,<ref name="pcj.com"/> including asphalt and lubrication products. Just 20% of imported fuels are used for road transportation, the rest being used by the bauxite industry, electricity generation, and aviation. 30,000 barrels/day of crude imports are processed into various motor fuels and asphalt by the Petrojam Refinery in Kingston.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.petrojam.com/about-us/corporate-fact-sheet |title=Corporate Fact Sheet &#124; Petrojam Limited |publisher=Petrojam.com |access-date=2017-09-25 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160415220606/http://www.petrojam.com/about-us/corporate-fact-sheet |archive-date=15 April 2016 |url-status=dead }}</ref>

Jamaica produces enormous quantities of [[hydrous ethanol|drinking alcohol]] (at least 5% water content), most of which appears to be consumed as beverages, and none used as motor fuel. Facilities exist to refine hydrous ethanol feedstock into [[Absolute ethanol|anhydrous ethanol]] (0% water content), but as of 2007, the process appeared to be uneconomic and the production plant was idle.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.pcj.com/petrojam/associate_text.htm |title=Petroleum Corp of Jamaica, Petrojam Ethanol |access-date=21 July 2007 |archive-url=https://archive.today/20070717000252/http://www.pcj.com/petrojam/associate_text.htm |archive-date=17 July 2007 |url-status=dead}}</ref> The facility has since been purchased by West Indies Petroleum Ltd. and repurposed for petroleum distillates.

===Communication===
{{main|Telecommunications in Jamaica}}

Jamaica has a fully [[Digital telephony|digital telephone communication system]] with a mobile penetration of over 95%.<ref name="EIU">[http://globaltechforum.eiu.com/index.asp?layout=newdebi&country_id=JM&country=Jamaica&title=Doing+eBusiness+in+Jamaica&channelid=6 Doing eBusiness in Jamaica] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110928173029/http://globaltechforum.eiu.com/index.asp?layout=newdebi&country_id=JM&country=Jamaica&title=Doing+eBusiness+in+Jamaica&channelid=6 |date=28 September 2011 }}, The Economist Intelligence Unit.</ref>

The country's two mobile operators – [[Flow (brand)|FLOW Jamaica]] (formerly LIME, bMobile and Cable and Wireless Jamaica) and [[Digicel|Digicel Jamaica]] have spent millions in network upgrades and expansion. The newest operator, Digicel was granted a licence in 2001 to operate mobile services in the newly liberalised telecom market that had once been the sole domain of the incumbent FLOW (then Cable and Wireless Jamaica) monopoly. Digicel opted for the more widely used [[GSM]] wireless system, while a past operator, Oceanic (which became Claro Jamaica and later merged with Digicel Jamaica in 2011) opted for the [[CDMA]] standard. FLOW (formerly "LIME" – pre-[[Columbus Communications]] merger) which had begun with [[Digital AMPS|TDMA]] standard, subsequently upgraded to GSM in 2002, decommissioned TDMA in 2006 and only utilised that standard until 2009 when LIME launched its 3G network.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.cwc.com/assets/uploads/files/Press%20Releases/3g%20launch%20in%20jamaica.pdf |title=LIME 3G launch in 2009 |access-date=23 May 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160625182344/http://www.cwc.com/assets/uploads/files/Press%20Releases/3g%20launch%20in%20jamaica.pdf |archive-date=25 June 2016 |url-status=dead }}</ref> Both operators currently provide islandwide coverage with HSPA+ (3G) technology.

A new entrant to the Jamaican communications market, [[Columbus Communications|Flow Jamaica]], laid a new [[Submarine communications cable|submarine cable]] connecting Jamaica to the United States. This new cable increases the total number of submarine cables connecting Jamaica to the rest of the world to four. Cable and Wireless Communications (parent company of LIME) acquired the company in late 2014 and replaced their brand LIME with FLOW.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.cwc.com/live/news-and-media/press-releases/new-flow-brand-unveiled-in-jamaica.html |title=Cable & Wireless Communications – NEW FLOW BRAND UNVEILED IN JAMAICA |website=www.cwc.com |access-date=23 May 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160625152402/http://www.cwc.com/live/news-and-media/press-releases/new-flow-brand-unveiled-in-jamaica.html |archive-date=25 June 2016 |url-status=dead }}</ref> [[Flow (brand)|FLOW Jamaica]] currently has the most broadband and cable subscribers on the island and also has 1 million mobile subscribers,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.jamaicaobserver.com/business/Flow-celebrates-hitting-one-million-customers_61486 |title=Flow celebrates hitting one million customers |first=Jamaica Observer |last=Limited |website=Jamaica Observer |access-date=23 May 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160524044859/http://www.jamaicaobserver.com/business/Flow-celebrates-hitting-one-million-customers_61486 |archive-date=24 May 2016 |url-status=live }}</ref> second to Digicel (which had, at its peak, over 2 million mobile subscriptions on its network).

Digicel entered the broadband market in 2010 by offering WiMAX broadband,<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.telegeography.com/products/commsupdate/articles/2010/08/23/digicel-launches-wimax-to-non-business-users/ |title=Digicel launches WiMAX to non-business users |last=TeleGeography |website=www.telegeography.com |access-date=23 May 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160306013556/https://www.telegeography.com/products/commsupdate/articles/2010/08/23/digicel-launches-wimax-to-non-business-users/ |archive-date=6 March 2016 |url-status=live }}</ref> capable of up to 6 Mbit/s per subscriber. To further their broadband share post-LIME/FLOW merger in 2014, the company introduced a new broadband service called Digicel Play,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.digicelgroup.com/jm/en/Play.html |title=Home |website=www.digicelgroup.com |access-date=23 May 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160521133001/http://www.digicelgroup.com/jm/en/Play.html |archive-date=21 May 2016 |url-status=live }}</ref> which is Jamaica's second [[FTTx|FTTH]] offering (after LIME's deployment in selected communities in 2011<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.telegeography.com/products/commsupdate/articles/2011/12/16/lime-jamaica-launches-100mbps-ftth-service/|title=LIME Jamaica launches 100Mbps FTTH service|last=TeleGeography|access-date=23 May 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160624125845/https://www.telegeography.com/products/commsupdate/articles/2011/12/16/lime-jamaica-launches-100mbps-ftth-service/|archive-date=24 June 2016|url-status=live}}</ref>).

Digicel's competitor, [[Flow (brand)|FLOW Jamaica]], has a network consisting of [[ADSL]], Coaxial and Fibre to the Home (inherited from LIME) and only offers speeds up to 100 Mbit/s. FLOW has committed to expanding its Fibre offering to more areas in order to combat Digicel's entrance into the market.

The remote Arctic island of [[Jan Mayen]] and the [[archipelago]] of [[Svalbard]] also form part of Norway.{{refn|The [[Svalbard Treaty|Spitsbergen Treaty]] (also known as the [[Svalbard Treaty]]) of 9 February 1920 recognises Norway's full and absolute sovereignty over the arctic archipelago of Spitsbergen (now called [[Svalbard]]).<ref name="Board1986">{{cite book|author=National Research Council (U.S.).

Norway has a total area of {{convert|385,207|km2|sqmi}}<ref name="kart_2019" /> and a population of 5,385,300 as of November 2020.<ref>{{Cite web|last=Statistics Norway|date=23 November 2020|title=Population 3rd quarter 2020|url=https://www.ssb.no/en/befolkning/statistikker/folkemengde|access-date=26 December 2020}}</ref> The country shares a long eastern border with [[Sweden]] ([[List of countries and territories by land borders|1,619 km]] or 1,006&nbsp;mi long). Norway is bordered by [[Finland]] and [[Russia]] to the north-east, and the [[Skagerrak]] strait to the south, with [[Denmark]] on the other side. Norway has an extensive coastline, facing the North Atlantic Ocean and the [[Barents Sea]]. The maritime influence also dominates Norway's climate with mild lowland temperatures on the sea coasts, whereas the interior, while colder, is also a lot milder than areas elsewhere in the world on such northerly latitudes. Even during [[polar night]] in the north, temperatures above freezing are commonplace on the coastline. The maritime influence brings high rainfall and snowfall to some areas of the country.

[[Harald V of Norway|Harald V]] of the [[House of Glücksburg]] is the current [[King of Norway]]. [[Erna Solberg]] has been prime minister since 2013 when she replaced [[Jens Stoltenberg]]. As a [[unitary state|unitary]] [[sovereign state]] with a [[constitutional monarchy]], Norway [[separation of powers|divides state power]] between the [[Storting|parliament]], the [[Cabinet of Norway|cabinet]] and the [[Supreme Court of Norway|supreme court]], as determined by the [[Constitution of Norway|1814 constitution]]. The kingdom was established in 872 as a merger of many [[petty kingdoms of Norway|petty kingdoms]] and has existed continuously for 1,{{age|1872}} years. From 1537 to 1814, Norway was a part of the Kingdom of [[Denmark–Norway]], and from 1814 to 1905, it was in a [[Union between Sweden and Norway|personal union]] with the Kingdom of Sweden. Norway was neutral during the [[World War I|First World War]] and remained so until April 1940 when the country was [[Operation Weserübung|invaded]] and [[German occupation of Norway|occupied]] by Germany until the end of [[World War II]].

Norway has both administrative and political subdivisions on two levels: [[Counties of Norway|counties]] and [[list of municipalities of Norway|municipalities]]. The [[Sámi people]] have a certain amount of self-determination and influence over traditional territories through the [[Sámi Parliament of Norway|Sámi Parliament]] and the [[Finnmark Act]]. Norway [[Norway–European Union relations|maintains close ties]] with both the [[European Union]] and the [[United States-Norway relations|United States]]. Norway is also a founding member of the [[United Nations]], [[NATO]], the [[European Free Trade Association]], the [[Council of Europe]], the [[Antarctic Treaty System|Antarctic Treaty]], and the [[Nordic Council]]; a member of the [[European Economic Area]], the [[World Trade Organization|WTO]], and the [[OECD]]; and a part of the [[Schengen Area]]. In addition, the Norwegian languages share [[mutual intelligibility]] with [[Danish language|Danish]] and [[Swedish language|Swedish]].

Norway has two official names: ''Norge'' in [[Bokmål]] and ''Noreg'' in [[Nynorsk]]. The English name Norway comes from the [[Old English]] word ''Norþweg'' mentioned in 880, meaning "northern way" or "way leading to the north", which is how the [[Anglo-Saxon]]s referred to the coastline of [[Atlantic]] Norway<ref name="Nomino-NRK">{{Cite episode |title=Nomino 6:6 |url=https://tv.nrk.no/serie/nomino/DVFJ63000615/sesong-2/episode-6#t=22m18s |access-date= 5 October 2016 |series=Nomino |station=[[NRK]] |date= 4 October 2016 |season=2 |time=22:18 |language=no}}</ref><ref name="Tvil-Forskning">{{cite web |url = http://forskning.no/historie-sprak/2016/02/sar-tvil-om-norges-opphav |title= Sår tvil om Norges opphav |publisher=Forskning.no for [[Universitetet i Agder]] |language = no}}</ref> similar to leading theory about the origin of the Norwegian language name.<ref>Krag, Claus, 2003: "The early unification of Norway."

There is some disagreement about whether the native name of Norway originally had the same etymology as the English form. According to the traditional dominant view, the first component was originally [[:wikt:norðr|''norðr'']], a [[cognate]] of English ''north'', so the full name was ''Norðr [[wikt:vegr|vegr]]'', "the way northwards", referring to the sailing route along the Norwegian coast, and contrasting with ''suðrvegar'' "southern way" (from [[Old Norse]] [[:wikt:suðr|suðr]]) for (Germany), and ''austrvegr'' "eastern way" (from [[:wikt:austr|austr]]) for the [[Baltic Sea|Baltic]]. In the translation of [[Orosius]] for Alfred, the name is ''Norðweg'', while in younger Old English sources the ð is gone.<ref name="Eldar Heide"/> In the 10th century many Norsemen settled in Northern France, according to the sagas, in the area that was later called [[Normandy]] from ''norðmann'' (Norseman or Scandinavian<ref>Stenton, F.

''Origin of the Scandinavian nations and languages: an introduction.'' Halden: H.

Volume 1 of ''Vestlandets historie'' (edited by Knut Helle). Bergen: Vigmostad og Bjørke, 2006.</ref>

According to another theory, the first component was a word ''nór'', meaning "narrow" (Old English ''nearu''), referring to the inner-[[archipelago]] sailing route through the land ("narrow way"). The interpretation as "northern", as reflected in the English and Latin forms of the name, would then have been due to later [[folk etymology]]. This latter view originated with philologist Niels Halvorsen Trønnes in 1847; since 2016 it as also advocated by language student and activist Klaus Johan Myrvoll and was adopted by [[philology]] professor [[Michael Schulte (professor)|Michael Schulte]].<ref name="Nomino-NRK"/><ref name="Tvil-Forskning"/> The form ''Nore'' is still used in placenames such as the village of [[Nore, Norway|Nore]] and lake [[Norefjorden]] in [[Buskerud]] county, and still has the same meaning.<ref name="Nomino-NRK"/><ref name="Tvil-Forskning"/> Among other arguments in favour of the theory, it is pointed out that the word has a long vowel in Skaldic poetry and is not attested with <<nowiki/>ð> in any native Norse texts or inscriptions (the earliest runic attestations have the spellings ''nuruiak'' and ''nuriki''). This resurrected theory has received some pushback by other scholars on various grounds, e.&nbsp;g. the uncontroversial presence of the element ''norðr'' in the ethnonym ''norðrmaðr'' "Norseman, Norwegian person" (modern Norwegian ''nordmann''), and the adjective ''norrǿnn'' "northern, Norse, Norwegian", as well as the very early attestations of the Latin and Anglo-Saxon forms with <nowiki>

The adjective ''Norwegian'', recorded from c. 1600, is derived from the [[Middle Latin|latinisation]] of the name as ''Norwegia''; in the adjective ''Norwegian'', the Old English spelling '-weg' has survived.<ref>Dieserud, J.: Norse and Norseman versus Norwegian.

After Norway had become Christian, ''Noregr'' and ''Noregi'' had become the most common forms, but during the 15th century, the newer forms ''Noreg(h)'' and ''Norg(h)e'', found in medieval Icelandic manuscripts, took over and have survived until the modern day.{{citation needed|date=September 2015}}

=== Prehistory ===
{{Main|Scandinavian prehistory}}
The first inhabitants were the [[Ahrensburg culture]] (11th to 10th millennia BC), which was a late [[Upper Paleolithic]] culture during the Younger Dryas, the last period of cold at the end of the [[Weichselian glaciation]]. The culture is named after the village of [[Ahrensburg]], {{convert|25|km|2|abbr=on}} north-east of [[Hamburg]] in the [[Schleswig-Holstein|German state of Schleswig-Holstein]], where wooden arrow shafts and clubs have been excavated.<ref name="Genetics">{{Cite journal|pmid = 12173029|year = 2002|last1 = Passarino|first1 = G|title = Different genetic components in the Norwegian population revealed by the analysis of mtDNA and Y chromosome polymorphisms|journal = European Journal of Human Genetics|volume = 10|issue = 9|pages = 521–529|last2 = Cavalleri|first2 = G.

The oldest finds are stone tools dating from 9,500 to 6,000 BC, discovered in [[Finnmark]] ([[Komsa culture]]) in the north and [[Rogaland]] ([[Fosna-Hensbacka culture|Fosna culture]]) in the south-west. However, theories about two altogether different cultures (the Komsa culture north of the [[Arctic Circle]] being one and the Fosna culture from [[Trøndelag]] to [[Oslofjord]] being the other) were rendered obsolete in the 1970s.

More recent finds along the entire coast revealed to archaeologists that the difference between the two can simply be ascribed to different types of tools and not to different cultures. Coastal fauna provided a means of livelihood for fishermen and hunters, who may have made their way along the southern coast about 10,000 BC when the interior was still covered with ice. It is now thought that these so-called "Arctic" peoples came from the south and followed the coast northward considerably later.

In the southern part of the country are dwelling sites dating from about 5,000 BC. Finds from these sites give a clearer idea of the life of the hunting and fishing peoples. The implements vary in shape and mostly are made of different kinds of stone; those of later periods are more skilfully made. [[Rock carvings]] (i.e. petroglyphs) have been found, usually near hunting and fishing grounds. They represent game such as [[deer]], [[reindeer]], [[Moose|elk]], bears, birds, [[Earless seal|seals]], whales, and fish (especially [[salmon]] and [[halibut]]), all of which were vital to the way of life of the coastal peoples. The [[rock carvings at Alta]] in Finnmark, the largest in Scandinavia, were made at sea level from 4,200 to 500 BC and mark the progression of the land as the sea rose after the last ice age ended.

=== Bronze Age ===
{{Main|Nordic Bronze Age}}
[[File:Bronze Age boats.png|thumb|right|[[Nordic Bronze Age]] [[rock carvings]] at [[Steinkjer]], [[Central Norway]]]]
Between 3000 and 2500 BC, new settlers ([[Corded Ware culture]]) arrived in [[eastern Norway]]. They were [[Proto-Indo-Europeans|Indo-European]] [[farmers]] who grew grain and kept cows and sheep. The hunting-fishing population of the west coast was also gradually replaced by farmers, though hunting and fishing remained useful secondary means of livelihood.

From about 1500 BC, [[bronze]] was gradually introduced, but the use of stone implements continued; Norway had few riches to barter for bronze goods, and the few finds consist mostly of elaborate weapons and brooches that only chieftains could afford. Huge burial cairns built close to the sea as far north as [[Harstad]] and also inland in the south are characteristic of this period. The motifs of the rock carvings differ slightly from those typical of the [[Stone Age]]. Representations of the Sun, animals, trees, weapons, ships, and people are all strongly stylised.

Thousands of [[rock carving]]s from this period depict ships, and the large stone burial monuments known as [[stone ship]]s, suggest that ships and seafaring played an important role in the culture at large. The depicted ships most likely represent sewn plank built canoes used for warfare, fishing and trade. These ship types may have their origin as far back as the neolithic period and they continue into the Pre-Roman Iron Age, as exemplified by the [[Hjortspring boat]].<ref>Ling 2008.

=== Iron Age ===
{{Main|Iron Age Scandinavia}}

Little has been found dating from the early [[Iron Age]] (the last 500 years BC). The dead were cremated, and their graves contain few burial goods. During the first four centuries AD, the people of Norway were in contact with Roman-occupied [[Gaul]]. About 70 Roman bronze cauldrons, often used as burial urns, have been found. Contact with the civilised countries farther south brought a knowledge of [[runes]]; the oldest known Norwegian runic inscription dates from the 3rd century. At this time, the amount of settled area in the country increased, a development that can be traced by coordinated studies of [[topography]], [[archaeology]], and place-names. The oldest root names, such as nes, vik, and bø ("cape," "bay," and "farm"), are of great antiquity, dating perhaps from the Bronze Age, whereas the earliest of the groups of compound names with the suffixes vin ("meadow") or heim ("settlement"), as in Bjǫrgvin (Bergen) or Sǿheim (Seim), usually date from the 1st century AD.

[[File:Jordanes, Norway tribes.png|thumb|upright=1.2|Locations of the [[Germanic peoples|Germanic]] tribes described by [[Jordanes]] in Norway]]

Archaeologists first made the decision to divide the Iron Age of Northern Europe into distinct pre-Roman and [[Roman Iron Age]]s after Emil Vedel unearthed a number of Iron Age artefacts in 1866 on the island of [[Bornholm]].<ref>Vedel, ''Bornholms Oldtidsminder og Oldsager'', (Copenhagen 1886).</ref> They did not exhibit the same permeating Roman influence seen in most other artefacts from the early centuries AD, indicating that parts of northern Europe had not yet come into contact with the Romans at the beginning of the [[Iron Age]].

=== Migration period ===
{{Main|Migration period}}
{{See also|Petty kingdoms of Norway}}
The destruction of the [[Western Roman Empire]] by the [[Germanic peoples]] in the 5th century is characterised by rich finds, including [[tribal chief]]s' graves containing magnificent weapons and gold objects.{{citation needed|date=April 2014}} Hill forts were built on precipitous rocks for defence. Excavation has revealed stone foundations of farmhouses {{convert|18|to|27|m|ft}} long—one even {{convert|46|m|ft|abbr=off}} long—the roofs of which were supported on wooden posts. These houses were family homesteads where several generations lived together, with people and cattle under one roof.{{citation needed|date=April 2014}}

These states were based on either clans or tribes (e.g., the [[Horder]] of [[Hordaland]] in [[western Norway]]). By the 9th century, each of these small states had [[Thing (assembly)|''things'']] (local or regional assemblies) for negotiating and settling disputes. The ''thing'' meeting places, each eventually with a [[hörgr]] (open-air sanctuary) or a [[heathen hof]] (temple; literally "hill"), were usually situated on the oldest and best farms, which belonged to the chieftains and wealthiest farmers. The regional ''things'' united to form even larger units: assemblies of deputy yeomen from several regions. In this way, the ''lagting'' (assemblies for negotiations and lawmaking) developed. The Gulating had its meeting place by [[Sognefjord]] and may have been the centre of an aristocratic confederation{{citation needed|date=April 2014}} along the western fjords and islands called the Gulatingslag. The Frostating was the assembly for the leaders in the [[Trondheimsfjord]] area; the [[Earls of Lade]], near [[Trondheim]], seem to have enlarged the Frostatingslag by adding the coastland from [[Romsdalsfjord]] to [[Lofoten]].{{citation needed|date=April 2014}}

From the 8th to the 10th century, the wider Scandinavian region was the source of [[Viking]]s. The looting of the monastery at [[Lindisfarne]] in Northeast England in 793 by [[North Germanic peoples|Norse people]] has long been regarded as the event which marked the beginning of the [[Viking Age]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://loststory.net/node/91 |title=Age of the vikings |publisher=loststory|access-date=17 February 2015}}</ref> This age was characterised by expansion and emigration by Viking [[seafarer]]s. They [[colonise]]d, raided, and traded in all parts of Europe. Norwegian Viking explorers discovered [[Iceland]] by accident in the 9th century when heading for the [[Faroe Islands]], and eventually came across [[Vinland]], known today as [[Newfoundland (island)|Newfoundland]], in Canada.

According to tradition, [[Harald Fairhair]] unified them into one in 872 after the [[Battle of Hafrsfjord]] in [[Stavanger]], thus becoming the first king of a united Norway.<ref>[[#Larsen|Larsen]], p. 83.</ref> Harald's realm was mainly a South Norwegian coastal state. Fairhair ruled with a strong hand and according to the sagas, many Norwegians left the country to live in Iceland, the [[Faroe Islands]], [[Greenland]], and parts of [[Great Britain|Britain]] and Ireland. The modern-day Irish cities of [[Dublin]], [[Limerick]] and [[Waterford]] were founded by Norwegian settlers.<ref>[[R. F. Foster (historian)|Foster, R. F.]] (2001) ''The Oxford History of Ireland''. Oxford University Press. {{ISBN|019280202X}}</ref>

[[Norse mythology|Norse traditions]] were replaced slowly by [[Christian mythology|Christian ones]] in the late 10th and early 11th centuries. One of the most important sources for the history of the 11th century Vikings is the treaty between the Icelanders and Olaf Haraldsson, king of Norway circa 1015 to 1028.<ref>Jones, Gwyn, A history of the Vikings (Oxford 2001).</ref> This is largely attributed to the missionary kings [[Olaf I of Norway|Olav Tryggvasson]] and [[Olaf II of Norway|St. Olav]]. [[Haakon I of Norway|Haakon the Good]] was Norway's first Christian king, in the mid-10th century, though his attempt to introduce the religion was rejected. Born sometime in between 963 and 969, Olav Tryggvasson set off raiding in England with 390 ships. He attacked London during this raiding. Arriving back in Norway in 995, Olav landed in [[Moster (island)|Moster]]. There he built a church which became the first [[Old Moster Church|Christian church]] ever built in Norway. From Moster, Olav sailed north to [[Trondheim]] where he was proclaimed King of Norway by the Eyrathing in 995.<ref>[[#Larsen|Larsen]], p. 95.</ref>

[[Feudalism]] never really developed in Norway or Sweden, as it did in the rest of Europe. However, the administration of government took on a very conservative feudal character. The [[Hanseatic League]] forced the royalty to cede to them greater and greater concessions over foreign trade and the economy. The League had this hold over the royalty because of the loans the Hansa had made to the royalty and the large debt the kings were carrying. The League's monopolistic control over the economy of Norway put pressure on all classes, especially the peasantry, to the degree that no real [[burgher (title)|burgher]] class existed in Norway.<ref>[[#Larsen|Larsen]], p. 201.</ref>

{{See also|Greater Norway|Civil war era in Norway}}
[[File:Norwegian Hereditary Empire excluding Greenland.png|thumb|[[Kingdom of Norway (872–1397)|Norwegian Kingdom]] at its greatest extent, 13th century]]
From the 1040s to 1130, the country was at peace.<ref>Stenersen: 36</ref>  In 1130, the [[civil war era in Norway|civil war era]] broke out on the basis of [[line of succession to the Norwegian throne|unclear succession laws]], which allowed all the king's sons to rule jointly. For periods there could be peace, before a lesser son allied himself with a chieftain and started a new conflict. The [[Archdiocese of Nidaros]] was created in 1152 and attempted to control the appointment of kings.<ref>Stenersen: 38</ref> The church inevitably had to take sides in the conflicts, with the civil wars also becoming an issue regarding the church's influence of the king. The wars ended in 1217 with the appointment of [[Håkon Håkonsson]], who introduced clear law of succession.<ref>Stenersen: 39</ref>

From 1000 to 1300, the population increased from 150,000 to 400,000, resulting both in more land being cleared and the subdivision of farms. While in the Viking Age all farmers owned their own land, by 1300, seventy percent of the land was owned by the king, the church, or the aristocracy. This was a gradual process which took place because of farmers borrowing money in poor times and not being able to repay. However, tenants always remained free men and the large distances and often scattered ownership meant that they enjoyed much more freedom than continental serfs. In the 13th century, about twenty percent of a farmer's yield went to the king, church and landowners.<ref>Stenersen: 37</ref>

The 14th century is described as Norway's [[Golden Age]], with peace and increase in trade, especially with the British Islands, although Germany became increasingly important towards the end of the century. Throughout the [[High Middle Ages]], the king established Norway as a sovereign state with a central administration and local representatives.<ref>Stenersen: 41</ref>

In 1349, the [[Black Death]] spread to Norway and had within a year killed a third of the population. Later plagues reduced the population to half the starting point by 1400. Many communities were entirely wiped out, resulting in an abundance of land, allowing farmers to switch to more [[animal husbandry]]. The reduction in taxes weakened the king's position,<ref>Stenersen: 44</ref> and many aristocrats lost the basis for their surplus, reducing some to mere farmers. High [[tithe]]s to church made it increasingly powerful and the archbishop became a member of the [[Norwegian Council of State|Council of State]].<ref name=s45>Stenersen: 45</ref>
[[File:Bryggen, Bergen3.JPG|thumb|[[Bryggen]] in [[Bergen]], once the center of trade in Norway under the [[Hanseatic League]] trade network, now preserved as a [[World Heritage Site]]]]
The [[Hanseatic League]] took control over Norwegian trade during the 14th century and established a trading center in [[Bergen]]. In 1380, [[Olaf II of Denmark|Olaf Haakonsson]] inherited both the Norwegian and Danish thrones, creating a union between the two countries.<ref name=s45 /> In 1397, under [[Margaret I of Denmark|Margaret I]], the [[Kalmar Union]] was created between the three Scandinavian countries. She waged war against the Germans, resulting in a trade blockade and higher taxation on Norwegian goods, which resulted in [[Engelbrekt rebellion|a rebellion]]. However, the Norwegian Council of State was too weak to pull out of the union.<ref name=s46>Stenersen: 46</ref>

Margaret pursued a centralising policy which inevitably favoured Denmark, because it had a greater population than Norway and Sweden combined.<ref>Derry p. 75</ref> Margaret also granted trade privileges to the Hanseatic merchants of [[Lübeck]] in Bergen in return for recognition of her right to rule, and these hurt the Norwegian economy. The Hanseatic merchants formed a state within a state in Bergen for generations.<ref>Derry pp. 77–78</ref> Even worse were the pirates, the "[[Victual Brothers]]", who launched three devastating raids on the port (the last in 1427).<ref>Derry p. 77</ref>

Norway slipped ever more to the background under the [[House of Oldenburg|Oldenburg dynasty]] (established 1448). There was one revolt under [[Knut Alvsson]] in 1502.<ref>Derry pp. 81–82</ref> Norwegians had some affection for [[Christian II of Denmark|King Christian II]], who resided in the country for several years.

=== Kalmar Union ===

Upon the death of [[Haakon V of Norway|Haakon V]] (King of Norway) in 1319, [[Magnus IV of Sweden|Magnus Erikson]], at just three years old, inherited the throne as King Magnus VII of Norway. At the same time, a movement to make Magnus King of Sweden proved successful, and both the kings of Sweden and of Denmark were elected to the throne by their respective nobles, Thus, with his election to the throne of Sweden, both Sweden and Norway were united under King Magnus VII.<ref name=larsen>[[#Larsen|Larsen]], p. 192.</ref>

In 1349, the [[Black Death]] radically altered Norway, killing between 50% and 60% of its population<ref>{{Cite journal|pmid = 2197762|year = 1990|last1 = Oeding|first1 = P|title = The black death in Norway|journal = Tidsskrift for den Norske Laegeforening|volume = 110|issue = 17|pages = 2204–08}}</ref> and leaving it in a period of social and economic decline.<ref name=enc>{{cite encyclopedia|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/67758/Black-Death |title=Black Death (pandemic) |encyclopedia=Encyclopædia Britannica |access-date=23 July 2011}}</ref> The plague left Norway very poor.

King Magnus VII ruled Norway until 1350, when his son, Haakon, was placed on the throne as [[Haakon VI of Norway|Haakon VI]].<ref name=autogenerated3>[[#Larsen|Larsen]], p. 195</ref> In 1363, Haakon VI married [[Margaret I of Denmark|Margaret]], the daughter of King [[Valdemar IV of Denmark]].<ref name="enc"/> Upon the death of Haakon VI, in 1379, his son, [[Olaf II of Denmark|Olaf IV]], was only 10 years old.<ref name="enc"/> Olaf had already been elected to the throne of Denmark on 3 May 1376.<ref name="enc"/> Thus, upon Olaf's accession to the throne of Norway, Denmark and Norway entered [[personal union]].<ref name=autogenerated2>[[#Larsen|Larsen]], p. 197</ref> Olaf's mother and Haakon's widow, Queen Margaret, managed the foreign affairs of Denmark and Norway during the minority of Olaf IV.<ref name="enc"/>

Margaret was working toward a union of Sweden with Denmark and Norway by having Olaf elected to the Swedish throne.

On 2 February 1388, Norway followed suit and crowned Margaret.<ref name=enc/> Queen Margaret knew that her power would be more secure if she were able to find a king to rule in her place. She settled on [[Eric of Pomerania]], grandson of her sister. Thus at an all-Scandinavian meeting held at Kalmar, Erik of Pomerania was crowned king of all three Scandinavian countries. Thus, royal politics resulted in personal unions between the [[Nordic countries]], eventually bringing the thrones of Norway, [[Denmark]], and [[Sweden]] under the control of Queen Margaret when the country entered into the [[Kalmar Union]].

=== Union with Denmark ===
{{Main|Denmark–Norway}}
After Sweden broke out of the [[Kalmar Union]] in 1521, Norway tried to follow suit, {{citation needed|date=May 2015}} but the subsequent rebellion was defeated, and Norway remained in a union with Denmark until 1814, a total of 434 years. During the [[Romantic nationalism|national romanticism]] of the 19th century, this period was [[Nicolai Wergeland|by some]] referred to as the "400-Year Night", since all of the kingdom's royal, intellectual, and administrative power was centred in [[Copenhagen]] in Denmark. In fact, it was a period of great prosperity and progress for Norway, especially in terms of shipping and foreign trade, and it also secured the country's revival from the demographic catastrophe it suffered in the [[Black Death]]. Based on the respective natural resources, Denmark–Norway was in fact a very good match since Denmark supported Norway's needs for grain and food supplies, and Norway supplied Denmark with timber, metal, and fish.

With the [[Reformation in Denmark–Norway and Holstein|introduction of Protestantism]] in 1536, the archbishopric in Trondheim was dissolved, and Norway lost its independence, and effectually became a colony of Denmark. The Church's incomes and possessions were instead redirected to the court in Copenhagen. Norway lost the steady stream of pilgrims to the relics of [[Olaf II of Norway|St. Olav]] at the [[Nidaros]] shrine, and with them, much of the contact with cultural and economic life in the rest of Europe.

Eventually restored as a kingdom (albeit in legislative union with Denmark) in 1661, Norway saw its land area decrease in the 17th century with the loss of the provinces [[Bohuslän|Båhuslen]], [[Jämtland|Jemtland]], and [[Härjedalen|Herjedalen]] to Sweden, as the result of a number of disastrous wars with Sweden. In the north, however, its territory was increased by the acquisition of the northern provinces of [[Troms]] and [[Finnmark]], at the expense of Sweden and Russia.

[[File:Eidsvoll riksraad 1814.jpeg|thumb|The 1814 constitutional assembly, painted by [[Oscar Wergeland]].]]
After Denmark–Norway was attacked by the United Kingdom at the 1807 [[Battle of Copenhagen (1807)|Battle of Copenhagen]], it entered into an alliance with [[Napoleon]], with the war leading to dire conditions and mass [[starvation]] in 1812. As the Danish kingdom found itself on the losing side in 1814, it was forced, under terms of the [[Treaty of Kiel]], to cede Norway to the king of Sweden, while the old Norwegian provinces of Iceland, Greenland, and the Faroe Islands remained with the Danish crown.<ref>[[Treaty of Kiel]], 14 January 1814.</ref> Norway took this opportunity to declare independence, adopted a constitution based on [[United States Constitution|American]] and [[Constitution of France|French]] models, and elected the Crown Prince of Denmark and Norway, [[Christian VIII of Denmark|Christian Frederick]], as king on 17 May 1814. This is the famous [[Norwegian Constitution Day|Syttende mai]] (Seventeenth of May) holiday celebrated by Norwegians and Norwegian-Americans alike. ''Syttende mai'' is also called ''Norwegian Constitution Day''.

Norwegian opposition to the great powers' decision to link Norway with Sweden caused the [[Swedish–Norwegian War (1814)|Norwegian–Swedish War]] to break out as Sweden tried to subdue Norway by military means. As Sweden's military was not strong enough to defeat the Norwegian forces outright, and Norway's treasury was not large enough to support a protracted war, and as British and Russian navies blockaded the Norwegian coast,<ref>{{cite book|last = Nicolson|first = Harold|title = The Congress of Vienna; a study in allied unity, 1812–1822|publisher = Constable & co. ltd|year = 1946|page =295|quote=The British Government sought to overcome this reluctance by assisting Russia in blockading the coast of Norway}}</ref> the belligerents were forced to negotiate the [[Convention of Moss]]. According to the terms of the convention, Christian Frederik abdicated the Norwegian throne and authorised the [[Parliament of Norway]] to make the necessary constitutional amendments to allow for the [[personal union]] that Norway was forced to accept. On 4 November 1814, the Parliament (Storting) elected [[Charles XIII of Sweden]] as king of Norway, thereby establishing the [[Union between Sweden and Norway|union with Sweden]].<ref>[[#Larsen|Larsen]], p. 572.</ref> Under this arrangement, Norway kept its liberal constitution and its own independent institutions, though it shared a common monarch and common foreign policy with Sweden. Following the recession caused by the [[Napoleonic Wars]], economic development of Norway remained slow until economic growth began around 1830.<ref>[[#Larsen|Larsen]], p. 423.</ref>
[[File:Havreskjering Fossheim Lindahl.jpeg|thumb|Harvesting of oats in [[Jølster]], c. 1890]]
This period also saw the rise of the [[Norwegian romantic nationalism]], as Norwegians sought to define and express a distinct national character. The movement covered all branches of culture, including literature ([[Henrik Wergeland]] [1808–1845], [[Bjørnstjerne Bjørnson]] [1832–1910], [[Peter Christen Asbjørnsen]] [1812–1845], [[Jørgen Moe]] [1813–1882]), painting ([[Hans Gude]] [1825–1903], [[Adolph Tidemand]] [1814–1876]), music ([[Edvard Grieg]] [1843–1907]), and even language policy, where attempts to define a native written language for Norway led to today's two official written forms for Norwegian: [[Bokmål]] and [[Nynorsk]].

[[Charles XIV John of Sweden|King Charles III John]], who came to the throne of Norway and Sweden in 1818, was the second king following Norway's break from Denmark and the union with Sweden. Charles John was a complex man whose long reign extended to 1844. He protected the constitution and liberties of Norway and Sweden during the age of [[Klemens Wenzel, Prince von Metternich|Metternich]]. As such, he was regarded as a liberal monarch for that age. However, he was ruthless in his use of paid informers, the secret police and restrictions on the freedom of the press to put down public movements for reform—especially the Norwegian national independence movement.<ref>Franklin D. Scott, ''Sweden: the Nation's History'' ([[University of Minnesota Press]]: Minneapolis, 1977) p. 380.</ref>

The [[Romanticism|Romantic Era]] that followed the reign of King Charles III John brought some significant social and political reforms. In 1854, women won the right to inherit property in their own right, just like men. In 1863, the last trace of keeping unmarried women in the status of minors was removed. Furthermore, women were then eligible for different occupations, particularly the common school teacher.<ref>[[#Larsen|Larsen]], p. 432.</ref> By mid-century, Norway's democracy was limited by modern standards: Voting was limited to officials, property owners, leaseholders and burghers of incorporated towns.<ref>[[#Larsen|Larsen]], p. 431.</ref>
[[File:Saami Family 1900.jpg|thumb|left|A [[Sámi people|Sámi]] family in Norway, c. 1900]]
Still, Norway remained a conservative society. Life in Norway (especially economic life) was "dominated by the aristocracy of professional men who filled most of the important posts in the central government".<ref>[[#Larsen|Larsen]], p. 412.</ref> There was no strong bourgeosie class in Norway to demand a breakdown of this aristocratic control of the economy.<ref name="Marx Engels">See "The Civil War in Switzerland" by Frederick Engels contained in Marx & Engels, ''Collected Works: Volume 6'' (International Publishers, New York, 1976) p. 368.</ref> Thus, even while revolution swept over most of the countries of Europe in 1848, Norway was largely unaffected by revolts that year.<ref name="Marx Engels"/>

[[Marcus Thrane]] was a Utopian socialist. He made his appeal to the labouring classes urging a change of social structure "from below upwards." In 1848, he organised a labour society in [[Drammen]]. In just a few months, this society had a membership of 500 and was publishing its own newspaper. Within two years, 300 societies had been organised all over Norway, with a total membership of 20,000 persons. The membership was drawn from the lower classes of both urban and rural areas; for the first time these two groups felt they had a common cause.<ref>[[#Larsen|Larsen]], p. 433.</ref> In the end, the revolt was easily crushed; Thrane was captured and in 1855, after four years in jail, was sentenced to three additional years for crimes against the safety of the state. Upon his release, Marcus Thrane attempted unsuccessfully to revitalise his movement, but after the death of his wife, he migrated to the United States.<ref>{{cite encyclopedia|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/593569/Marcus-Moller-Thrane|title=Marcus Møller Thrane – Norwegian journalist and socialist|encyclopedia=Encyclopædia Britannica}}</ref>

In 1898, all men were granted [[universal suffrage]], followed by all [[Women's suffrage|women]] in 1913.

=== Dissolution of the union ===
{{Main|Norwegian union dissolution referendum, 1905|label 1=Union dissolution referendum|Dissolution of the union between Norway and Sweden}}
[[Christian Michelsen]], a shipping magnate and statesman, and Prime Minister of Norway from 1905 to 1907, played a central role in the peaceful separation of Norway from Sweden on 7 June 1905. A national referendum confirmed the people's preference for a monarchy over a republic. However, no Norwegian could legitimately claim the throne, since none of Norway's noble families could claim descent from medieval royalty. In European tradition, [[Royal descent|royal]] or "blue" blood is a precondition for laying claim to the throne.

The government then offered the throne of Norway to Prince Carl of Denmark, a prince of the Dano-German royal [[house of Schleswig-Holstein-Sonderburg-Glücksburg]] and a distant relative of several of Norway's medieval kings. After centuries of close ties between Norway and Denmark, a prince from the latter was the obvious choice for a European prince who could best relate to the Norwegian people. Following the plebiscite, he was unanimously elected king by the Norwegian [[Parliament of Norway|Parliament]], the first king of a fully independent Norway in 508 years (1397: [[Kalmar Union]]); he took the name [[Haakon VII of Norway|Haakon VII]]. In 1905, the country welcomed the prince from neighbouring Denmark, his wife [[Maud of Wales]] and their young son to re-establish Norway's royal house.

=== First and Second World Wars ===
{{See also|German occupation of Norway|Reichskommissariat Norwegen|Quisling regime}}
[[File:Battle of Norway.jpg|right|thumb|Scenes from the [[Norwegian Campaign]] in 1940]]

Throughout the [[First World War]], Norway was in principle a neutral country. In reality, however, Norway had been pressured by the British to hand over increasingly large parts of its large merchant fleet to the British at low rates, as well as to join the trade blockade against Germany. Norwegian merchant marine ships, often with Norwegian sailors still on board, were then sailing under the British flag and at risk of being sunk by German submarines. Thus, many Norwegian sailors and ships were lost. Thereafter, the world ranking of the Norwegian merchant navy fell from fourth place to sixth in the world.<ref>[[#Larsen|Larsen]], p. 510.</ref>

Norway also proclaimed its neutrality during the [[Second World War]], but despite this, it was [[Operation Weserübung|invaded by German forces]] on 9 April 1940. Although Norway was unprepared for the German surprise attack (see: [[Battle of Drøbak Sound]], [[Norwegian Campaign]], and [[Invasion of Norway]]), military and naval resistance lasted for two months. Norwegian armed forces in the north launched an offensive against the German forces in the [[Battles of Narvik]], until they were forced to surrender on 10 June after losing British support which had been diverted to France during the [[Battle of France|German invasion of France]].

[[Haakon VII of Norway|King Haakon]] and the Norwegian government escaped to [[Rotherhithe]] in London. Throughout the war they sent inspirational radio speeches and supported clandestine military actions in Norway against the Germans. On the day of the invasion, the leader of the small National-Socialist party [[Nasjonal Samling]], [[Vidkun Quisling]], tried to seize power, but was forced by the German occupiers to step aside. Real power was wielded by the leader of the German occupation authority, [[Reichskommissar]] [[Josef Terboven]]. Quisling, as ''minister president'', later formed a [[Quisling regime|collaborationist government under German control]]. Up to 15,000 Norwegians volunteered to fight in German units, including the [[Waffen-SS]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nuav.net/volunter.html |title=Norwegian volunteers in the Wehrmacht and SS |publisher=Nuav.net |date=9 April 1940 |access-date=5 April 2010}}</ref>

The fraction of the Norwegian population that supported Germany was traditionally smaller than in Sweden, but greater than is generally appreciated today.{{citation needed|date=January 2016}} It included a number of prominent personalities such as the Nobel-prize winning novelist [[Knut Hamsun]]. The concept of a "Germanic Union" of member states fit well into their thoroughly nationalist-patriotic ideology.

[[File:Ole Friele Backer norske flygere.jpg|thumb|right|Norwegian fighter pilots in the United Kingdom during World War II]]

Many Norwegians and persons of Norwegian descent joined the Allied forces as well as the [[Free Norwegian Forces]]. In June 1940, a small group had left Norway following their king to Britain. This group included 13 ships, five aircraft, and 500 men from the Royal Norwegian Navy. By the end of the war, the force had grown to 58 ships and 7,500 men in service in the Royal Norwegian Navy, 5 squadrons of aircraft (including Spitfires, Sunderland flying boats and Mosquitos) in the newly formed Norwegian Air Force, and land forces including the [[Norwegian Independent Company 1]] and 5 Troop as well as No. 10 [[British Commandos|Commandos]].{{citation needed|date=February 2017}}

During the five years of [[German occupation of Norway|German occupation]], Norwegians built a [[Norwegian resistance movement|resistance movement]] which fought the German occupation forces with both civil disobedience and armed resistance including the destruction of [[Norsk Hydro]]'s [[heavy water]] plant and stockpile of heavy water at [[Vemork]], which crippled the German nuclear programme (see: ''[[Norwegian heavy water sabotage]]''). More important to the [[Allies of World War II|Allied]] war effort, however, was the role of the Norwegian [[Merchant Navy|Merchant Marine]]. At the time of the [[invasion]], Norway had the fourth-largest merchant marine fleet in the world. It was led by the Norwegian shipping company [[Nortraship]] under the Allies throughout the war and took part in every war operation from the [[Dunkirk evacuation|evacuation of Dunkirk]] to the [[Normandy landings]]. Every December Norway gives a [[Christmas tree]] to the United Kingdom as thanks for the British assistance during the Second World War. A ceremony takes place to erect the tree in London's [[Trafalgar Square]].<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20111011171256/http://www.aftenposten.no/english/local/article2137248.ece PM to light London tree].

=== Post-World War II history ===
From 1945 to 1962, the [[Norwegian Labour Party|Labour Party]] held an absolute majority in the parliament. The government, led by prime minister [[Einar Gerhardsen]], embarked on a program inspired by [[Keynesian economics]], emphasising state financed industrialisation and co-operation between trade unions and [[employers' organisation]]s. Many measures of state control of the economy imposed during the war were continued, although the [[rationing]] of dairy products was lifted in 1949, while price control and rationing of housing and cars continued until 1960.
[[File:StatfjordA(Jarvin1982).jpg|thumb|Since the 1970s oil production has helped to expand the Norwegian economy and finance the Norwegian state. ([[Statfjord oil field]])]]
The wartime alliance with the United Kingdom and the United States was continued in the post-war years. Although pursuing the goal of a socialist economy, the Labour Party distanced itself from the Communists (especially after the Communists' seizure of power in [[Czechoslovakia]] in 1948), and strengthened its foreign policy and defence policy ties with the US. Norway received [[Marshall Plan]] aid from the United States starting in 1947, joined the [[Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development]] (OECD) one year later, and became a founding member of the [[NATO|North Atlantic Treaty Organization]] (NATO) in 1949.

The first oil was discovered at the small Balder field in 1967, production only began in 1999.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.norskolje.museum.no/balder/|title=Balder – Norsk Oljemuseum|website=www.norskolje.museum.no|access-date=6 October 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171007021055/http://www.norskolje.museum.no/balder/|archive-date=7 October 2017|url-status=dead}}</ref> In 1969, the [[Phillips Petroleum Company]] discovered petroleum resources at the [[Ekofisk oil field|Ekofisk]] field west of Norway. In 1973, the Norwegian government founded the State oil company, [[Statoil]]. Oil production did not provide net income until the early 1980s because of the large capital investment that was required to establish the country's petroleum industry. Around 1975, both the proportion and absolute number of workers in industry peaked. Since then labour-intensive industries and services like factory mass production and shipping have largely been outsourced.

Norway was a founding member of the [[European Free Trade Association]] (EFTA). Norway was twice invited to join the [[European Union]], but ultimately declined to join after referendums that failed by narrow margins in [[1972 Norwegian European Communities membership referendum|1972]] and [[1994 Norwegian European Union membership referendum|1994]].<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-20830201|title=Norwegian minister Espen Eide urges UK caution on quitting EU |date=23 December 2012 |publisher=BBC |access-date=23 December 2012}}</ref>
[[File:2011 Norway attacks flower march 2.jpg|thumb|Town Hall Square in Oslo filled with people with roses mourning the victims of the [[2011 Norway attacks#Utøya massacre|Utøya massacre]], 22 July 2011]]
In 1981, a Conservative government led by [[Kåre Willoch]] replaced the Labour Party with a policy of stimulating the [[stagflation|stagflated economy]] with tax cuts, economic liberalisation, deregulation of markets, and measures to curb record-high inflation (13.6% in 1981).

Norway's first female prime minister, [[Gro Harlem Brundtland]] of the Labour party, continued many of the reforms of her conservative predecessor, while backing traditional Labour concerns such as [[social security]], high taxes, the industrialisation of nature, and feminism. By the late 1990s, Norway had paid off its foreign debt and had started accumulating a [[sovereign wealth fund]]. Since the 1990s, a divisive question in politics has been how much of the income from petroleum production the government should spend, and how much it should save.

In 2011, Norway suffered [[2011 Norway attacks|two terrorist attacks]] on the same day conducted by [[Anders Behring Breivik]] which struck the [[Regjeringskvartalet|government quarter]] in Oslo and a summer camp of the Labour party's [[Workers' Youth League (Norway)|youth movement]] at [[Utøya]] island, resulting in 77 deaths and 319 wounded.

The [[2013 Norwegian parliamentary election]] brought a more conservative government to power, with the [[Conservative Party (Norway)|Conservative Party]] and the [[Progress Party (Norway)|Progress Party]] winning 43% of the electorate's votes.

[[List of glaciers in Norway|Numerous glaciers]] are found in Norway.

The land is mostly made of hard [[granite]] and [[gneiss]] rock, but [[slate]], [[sandstone]], and [[limestone]] are also common, and the lowest elevations contain marine deposits. Because of the [[Gulf Stream]] and prevailing westerlies, Norway experiences higher temperatures and more precipitation than expected at such northern latitudes, especially along the coast. The mainland experiences four distinct seasons, with colder winters and less precipitation inland. The northernmost part has a mostly maritime [[Subarctic climate]], while Svalbard has an [[Arctic]] [[tundra]] climate.

Because of the large latitudinal range of the country and the varied topography and climate, Norway has a larger number of different [[habitat]]s than almost any other European country. There are approximately 60,000 species in Norway and adjacent waters (excluding bacteria and viruses). The Norwegian Shelf large marine ecosystem is considered highly productive.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.eoearth.org/article/Norwegian_Shelf_large_marine_ecosystem|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121101005147/http://www.eoearth.org/article/Norwegian_Shelf_large_marine_ecosystem|archive-date=1 November 2012 |title=Norwegian Shelf ecosystem |publisher=Eoearth.org |access-date=30 May 2010}}</ref>

=== Climate ===
[[File:Norway Köppen.svg|thumb|[[Köppen climate classification]] types of Norway|alt=]]
The southern and western parts of Norway, fully exposed to Atlantic storm fronts, experience more precipitation and have milder winters than the eastern and far northern parts. Areas to the east of the coastal mountains are in a [[rain shadow]], and have lower rain and snow totals than the west. The lowlands around Oslo have the warmest and sunniest summers, but also cold weather and snow in wintertime.<ref name=Norwegian-Meteorological-Institute>{{cite web|url=https://met.no/English/Climate_in_Norway/|title=Climate in Norway(English)|last=Met.no|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170320232734/https://met.no/English/Climate_in_Norway/|archive-date=20 March 2017}}</ref><ref name=Book-Climate>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=az3qCAAAQBAJ&q=koppen+climate+norway&pg=PA5|title=Selected climatic data for a global set of standard stations for vegetation|isbn=978-9400980402|date=6 December 2012|last1=Muller|first1=M.

From late May to late July, the sun never completely descends beneath the horizon in areas north of the Arctic Circle (hence Norway's description as the "Land of the [[Midnight sun]]"), and the rest of the country experiences up to 20 hours of daylight per day. Conversely, from late November to late January, the sun never rises above the horizon in the north, and daylight hours are very short in the rest of the country.

The coastal climate of Norway is exceptionally mild compared with areas on similar latitudes elsewhere in the world, with the [[Gulf Stream]] passing directly offshore the northern areas of the Atlantic coast, continuously warming the region in the winter. Temperature anomalies found in coastal locations are exceptional, with [[Røst]] and [[Værøy]] lacking a meteorological winter in spite of being north of the Arctic Circle. The Gulf Stream has this effect only on the northern parts of Norway, not in the south, despite what is commonly believed. The northern coast of Norway would thus be ice-covered if not for the Gulf Stream.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://ocp.ldeo.columbia.edu/res/div/ocp/gs/|title=The Gulf Stream Myth|website=ocp.ldeo.columbia.edu}}</ref> As a side-effect, the Scandinavian Mountains prevent continental winds from reaching the coastline, causing very cool summers throughout Atlantic Norway. Oslo has more of a continental climate, similar to Sweden's. The mountain ranges have subarctic and tundra climates. There is also very high rainfall in areas exposed to the Atlantic, such as Bergen. Oslo, in comparison, is dry, being in a [[rain shadow]]. [[Skjåk]] in Oppland county is also in the rain shadow and is one of the driest places with {{convert|278|mm|abbr=off}} precipitation annually. [[Finnmarksvidda]] and the interior valleys of [[Troms]] and [[Nordland]] also receive less than {{convert|300|mm|abbr=off}} annually. [[Longyearbyen]] is the driest place in Norway with {{convert|190|mm|abbr=off}}.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.yr.no/artikkel/norske-steder-blant-de-torreste-i-europa-1.13096592|title=Norske steder blant de tørreste i Europa (Places in Norway among the driest in Europe)|last=NRK|date=21 August 2016|publisher=[[NRK]]|access-date=26 August 2016}}</ref>

Parts of southeastern Norway including parts of [[Mjøsa]] have warm-summer [[humid continental climate]]s ([[Köppen climate classification|Köppen]] Dfb), while the more southern and western coasts are mostly of the [[oceanic climate]] (Cfb). Further inland in southeastern and northern Norway, the [[subarctic climate]] (Dfc) dominates; this is especially true for areas in the rain shadow of the [[Scandinavian Mountains]]. Some of the inner valleys of [[Oppland]] get so little precipitation annually, thanks to the rain shadow effect, that they meet the requirements for dry-summer subarctic climates (Dsc). In higher altitudes, close to the coasts of southern and western Norway, one can find the rare subpolar oceanic climate (Cfc). This climate is also common in Northern Norway, usually in lower altitudes, all the way down to sea level. A small part of the northernmost coast of Norway has the [[Polar climate|tundra/alpine/polar climate]] (ET). Large parts of Norway are covered by mountains and high altitude plateaus, many of which also exhibit the [[Tundra climate|tundra/alpine/polar climate]] (ET).<ref name="Norwegian-Meteorological-Institute"/><ref>{{cite web|url=https://en.climate-data.org/country/38/|title=Climate of Norway: Temperature, Climate graph, Climate table for Norway|publisher=Climate-Data.org}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|url=https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/e7eb/d81d62f45c41d143df2c3f84e5a39ae03521.pdf|title=Updated world map of the Koppen-Geiger climate classification|last=A study behind the updated maps of Köppen-Geiger climate classification|journal=Hydrology and Earth System Sciences|year=2007|volume=11|issue=5|pages=1633–1644|doi=10.5194/HESS-11-1633-2007|bibcode=2007HESS...11.1633P|s2cid=9654551}}</ref><ref name="Book-Climate"/><ref>{{cite journal|url=https://koeppen-geiger.vu-wien.ac.at/present.htm|title=World map of Köppen-Geiger climate classification updated|journal=Meteorologische Zeitschrift|volume=15|issue=3|pages=259–263|last=Website with maps|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170405164155/http://koeppen-geiger.vu-wien.ac.at/present.htm|archive-date=5 April 2017|bibcode=2006MetZe..15..259K|year=2006|doi=10.1127/0941-2948/2006/0130}}</ref>

Seventeen species are listed mainly because they are endangered on a global scale, such as the [[Eurasian beaver|European beaver]], even if the population in Norway is not seen as endangered.

The largest predator in Norwegian waters is the [[sperm whale]], and the largest fish is the [[basking shark]]. The largest predator on land is the [[polar bear]], while the [[brown bear]] is the largest predator on the Norwegian mainland. The largest land animal on the mainland is the elk (American English: [[moose]]). The elk in Norway is known for its size and strength and is often called ''skogens konge'', "king of the forest".

According to the [[Constitution of Norway]], which was adopted on 17 May 1814<ref name="Constitution">{{cite web|url=https://stortinget.no/en/In-English/About-the-Storting/The-Constitution/The-Constitution/ |title=The Constitution – Complete text |work=The Storting's Information Corner |year=2011 |access-date=9 September 2011 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110829055430/http://www.stortinget.no/en/In-English/About-the-Storting/The-Constitution/The-Constitution/ |archive-date=29 August 2011}}</ref> and inspired by the [[United States Declaration of Independence]] and [[French Revolution]] of 1776 and 1789, respectively, Norway is a [[unitary state|unitary]] [[constitutional monarchy]] with a [[parliamentary system]] of government, wherein the [[Monarchy of Norway|King of Norway]] is the [[head of state]] and the [[Prime Minister of Norway|prime minister]] is the [[head of government]]. Power is separated among the legislative, executive and judicial branches of government, as defined by the Constitution, which serves as the country's supreme legal document.

The [[Norwegian Royal Family|monarch]] officially retains executive power. But following the introduction of a parliamentary system of government, the duties of the monarch have since become strictly representative and ceremonial,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.kongehuset.no/c27300/seksjonstekst/vis.html?tid=29977|title=The King's constitutional role |publisher=The Royal Court of Norway |access-date=24 April 2009}}</ref> such as the formal appointment and dismissal of the Prime Minister and other ministers in the executive government. Accordingly, the Monarch is [[commander-in-chief]] of the [[Norwegian Armed Forces]], and serves as chief diplomatic official abroad and as a symbol of unity. [[Harald V of Norway|Harald V]] of the [[House of Glücksburg|House of Schleswig-Holstein-Sonderburg-Glücksburg]] was crowned King of Norway in 1991, the first since the 14th century who has been born in the country.<ref name="norway.org">{{cite web|url=http://www.norway.org/aboutnorway/society/political/monarchy/ |title=The Monarchy |publisher=Norway.org |date=24 June 2010 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120222042421/http://www.norway.org/aboutnorway/society/political/monarchy/ |archive-date=22 February 2012}}</ref> [[Haakon, Crown Prince of Norway]], is the legal and rightful heir to the throne and the Kingdom.

In practice, the Prime Minister exercises the executive powers. Constitutionally, legislative power is vested with both the government and the Parliament of Norway, but the latter is the supreme legislature and a [[unicameralism|unicameral]] body.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.norway.org/aboutnorway/society/political/storting/ |title=The Storting |publisher=Norway.org |date=10 June 2009 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120126212450/http://www.norway.org/aboutnorway/society/political/storting/ |archive-date=26 January 2012}}</ref> Norway is fundamentally structured as a [[representative democracy]]. The Parliament can pass a law by simple majority of the 169 representatives, who are elected on the basis of [[proportional representation]] from 19 constituencies for four-year terms.

150 are elected directly from the 19 constituencies, and an additional 19 seats ("levelling seats") are allocated on a nationwide basis to make the representation in parliament correspond better with the popular vote for the political parties. A 4% election threshold is required for a party to gain levelling seats in Parliament.<ref name="Election threshold">{{cite web|url=http://www.parties-and-elections.de/norway.html |title=Parties and Elections in Europe |first=Wolfram |last=Nordsieck |publisher=parties-and-elections.de |year=2011 |quote=Storting, 4-year term, 4% threshold (supplementary seats) |access-date=10 September 2011 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110903220240/http://parties-and-elections.de/norway.html |archive-date=3 September 2011}}</ref> There are a total of 169 members of parliament.

The Parliament of Norway, called the ''[[Parliament of Norway|Stortinget]]'' (meaning Grand Assembly), ratifies national [[treaty|treaties]] developed by the executive branch. It can [[impeachment|impeach]] members of the government if their acts are declared unconstitutional. If an indicted suspect is impeached, Parliament has the power to remove the person from office.

The position of [[Prime Minister of Norway|prime minister]], Norway's head of government, is allocated to the member of Parliament who can obtain the confidence of a majority in Parliament, usually the current leader of the largest political party or, more effectively, through a coalition of parties. A single party generally does not have sufficient political power in terms of the number of seats to form a government on its own. Norway has often been ruled by minority governments.

The prime minister nominates the cabinet, traditionally drawn from members of the same political party or parties in the Storting, making up the government. The PM organises the executive government and exercises its power as vested by the Constitution.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.norway.org/aboutnorway/society/political/government |title=The Government |publisher=Norway.org |date=10 June 2009 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100903135300/http://www.norway.org/aboutnorway/society/political/government/ |archive-date=3 September 2010}}</ref> Norway has a state church, the Lutheran [[Church of Norway]], which has in recent years gradually been granted more internal autonomy in day-to-day affairs, but which still has a special constitutional status. Formerly, the PM had to have more than half the members of cabinet be members of the Church of Norway, meaning at least ten out of the 19 ministries. This rule was however removed in 2012. The issue of [[separation of church and state]] in Norway has been increasingly controversial, as many people believe it is time to change this, to reflect the growing diversity in the population. A part of this is the evolution of the public school subject Christianity, a required subject since 1739. Even the state's loss in a battle at the [[European Court of Human Rights]] at [[Strasbourg]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://hudoc.echr.coe.int/sites/eng/pages/search.aspx?i=001-81356#{"itemid":["001-81356"]} |title= Case of Folgerø and Others v. Norway |date=29 June 2007 |access-date=17 March 2015}}</ref> in 2007 did not settle the matter. As of 1 January 2017, the Church of Norway is a separate legal entity, and no longer a branch of the civil service.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.dagen.no/dagensdebatt/lederartikkel/P%C3%A5-statskirkens-siste-dag-429116|title=På statskirkens siste dag|newspaper=Dagen.no|language=no|access-date=4 February 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170205111011/http://www.dagen.no/dagensdebatt/lederartikkel/P%C3%A5-statskirkens-siste-dag-429116|archive-date=5 February 2017|url-status=dead}}</ref>

Through the [[Norwegian Council of State|Council of State]], a [[privy council]] presided over by the monarch, the prime minister and the cabinet meet at the [[Royal Palace, Oslo|Royal Palace]] and formally consult the Monarch. All government bills need the formal approval by the monarch before and after introduction to Parliament. The Council reviews and approves all of the monarch's actions as head of state. Although all government and parliamentary acts are decided beforehand, the privy council is an example of symbolic gesture the king retains.<ref name="norway.org"/>

Members of the Storting are directly elected from [[party-list proportional representation|party-lists]] [[proportional representation]] in nineteen [[plurality voting system|plural-member]] constituencies in a national [[multi-party system]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.norway.org/aboutnorway/society/political/general/ |title=Form of Government |publisher=Norway.org |date=10 September 2009 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://archive.today/20120222042417/http://www.norway.org/aboutnorway/society/political/general/ |archive-date=22 February 2012}}</ref> Historically, both the [[Norwegian Labour Party]] and [[Conservative Party (Norway)|Conservative Party]] have played leading political roles. In the early 21st century, the Labour Party has been in power since the [[2005 Norwegian parliamentary election|2005 election]], in a [[Red–Green Coalition]] with the [[Socialist Left Party (Norway)|Socialist Left Party]] and the [[Centre Party (Norway)|Centre Party]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.123independenceday.com/norway/political-system.html |title=Political System of Norway |publisher=123independenceday.com |access-date=27 January 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100225175552/http://www.123independenceday.com/norway/political-system.html |archive-date=25 February 2010 |url-status=dead }}</ref>

Since 2005, both the Conservative Party and the [[Progress Party (Norway)|Progress Party]] have won numerous seats in the Parliament, but not sufficient in the [[2009 Norwegian parliamentary election|2009 general election]] to overthrow the coalition. Commentators have pointed to the poor co-operation between the opposition parties, including the [[Liberal Party (Norway)|Liberals]] and the [[Christian Democratic Party (Norway)|Christian Democrats]]. [[Jens Stoltenberg]], the leader of the Labour Party, continued to have the necessary majority through his multi-party alliance to continue as PM until 2013.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.norway.org/aboutnorway/society/political/ |title=Political System |publisher=Norway.org |date=18 November 2009 |access-date=27 January 2010 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100412142148/http://www.norway.org/aboutnorway/society/political/ |archive-date=12 April 2010}}</ref>

In national elections in September 2013, voters ended eight years of Labor rule. Two political parties, [[Høyre]] and [[Progress Party (Norway)|Fremskrittspartiet]], elected on promises of tax cuts, more spending on infrastructure and education, better services and stricter rules on immigration, formed a government. Coming at a time when Norway's economy is in good condition with low unemployment, the rise of the right appeared to be based on other issues. [[Erna Solberg]] became prime minister, the second female prime minister after [[Gro Harlem Brundtland|Brundtland]] and the first conservative prime minister since [[Jan P. Syse|Syse]]. Solberg said her win was "a historic election victory for the right-wing parties".<ref>{{cite web|author=Bevanger, Lars |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-24014551 |title=Norway election: Erna Solberg to form new government |publisher=BBC |date=10 September 2013 |access-date=15 February 2014}}</ref>

=== Administrative divisions ===
{{Main|Administrative divisions of Norway|Counties of Norway|Municipalities of Norway|List of towns and cities in Norway|Dependencies of Norway}}
{{See also|Sápmi (area)}}
Norway, a [[unitary state]], is divided into eleven first-level administrative [[county|counties]] (''fylke''). The counties are administered through directly elected county assemblies who elect the County Governor. Additionally, the [[Norwegian Royal Family|King]] and government are represented in every county by a [[County governor (Norway)|fylkesmann]], who effectively acts as a Governor.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.norway.org/aboutnorway/society/political/local/ |title=Local Government |publisher=Norway.org |date=10 June 2009 |access-date=27 January 2010 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100611231520/http://www.norway.org/aboutnorway/society/political/local/ |archive-date=11 June 2010}}</ref> As such, the Government is directly represented at a local level through the County Governors' offices. The counties are then sub-divided into 356 second-level municipalities (''kommuner''), which in turn are administered by directly elected municipal council, headed by a mayor and a small executive cabinet. The capital of [[Oslo]] is considered both a county and a municipality.

Norway has two integral overseas territories: [[Jan Mayen]] and [[Svalbard]], the only developed island in the archipelago of the same name, located miles away to the north. There are three [[Antarctica|Antarctic]] and [[Subantarctic]] [[dependent territory|dependencies]]: [[Bouvet Island]], [[Peter I Island]], and [[Queen Maud Land]]. On most maps, there had been an unclaimed area between Queen Maud Land and the [[South Pole]] until 12 June 2015 when Norway formally annexed that area.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Rapp|first1=Ole Magnus|title=Norge utvider Dronning Maud Land helt frem til Sydpolen|journal=Aftenposten|url=http://www.aftenposten.no/nyheter/iriks/Norge-utvider-Dronning-Maud-Land-helt-frem-til-Sydpolen-8168779.html|access-date=22 September 2015|date=21 September 2015|location=Oslo, Norway|language=no|quote=…formålet med anneksjonen var å legge under seg det landet som til nå ligger herreløst og som ingen andre enn nordmenn har kartlagt og gransket.

Often, Norwegian city municipalities include large areas that are not developed; for example, Oslo municipality contains large forests, located north and south-east of the city, and over half of Bergen municipality consists of mountainous areas.

=== Judicial system and law enforcement ===
{{Main|Judiciary of Norway}}
Norway uses a [[civil law (legal system)|civil law system]] where laws are created and amended in Parliament and the system regulated through the [[Courts of justice of Norway]]. It consists of the [[Supreme Court of Norway|Supreme Court]] of 20 permanent judges and a [[Chief Justice of the Supreme Court of Norway|Chief Justice]], [[appellate court]]s, city and [[Courts of justice of Norway#District courts|district courts]], and [[conciliation councils]].<ref name="norway">{{cite web|url=http://www.norway.org/aboutnorway/society/political/judiciary/ |title=The Judiciary |publisher=Norway.org |date=10 June 2009 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120126212439/http://www.norway.org/aboutnorway/society/political/judiciary/ |archive-date=26 January 2012}}</ref> The judiciary is independent of executive and legislative branches. While the Prime Minister nominates Supreme Court Justices for office, their nomination must be approved by Parliament and formally confirmed by the Monarch in the Council of State. Usually, judges attached to regular courts are formally appointed by the Monarch on the advice of the Prime Minister.

The Courts' strict and formal mission is to regulate the Norwegian judicial system, interpret the Constitution, and as such implement the legislation adopted by Parliament. In its judicial reviews, it monitors the legislative and executive branches to ensure that they comply with provisions of enacted legislation.<ref name="norway"/>

The [[Law enforcement in Norway|law is enforced in Norway]] by the [[Norwegian Police Service]]. It is a Unified National Police Service made up of 27 Police Districts and several specialist agencies, such as [[Norwegian National Authority for the Investigation and Prosecution of Economic and Environmental Crime]], known as ''Økokrim''; and the [[National Criminal Investigation Service (Norway)|National Criminal Investigation Service]], known as ''Kripos'', each headed by a chief of police. The Police Service is headed by the [[National Police Directorate]], which reports to the Ministry of Justice and the Police. The Police Directorate is headed by a National Police Commissioner. The only exception is the [[Norwegian Police Security Service|Norwegian Police Security Agency]], whose head answers directly to the Ministry of Justice and the Police.

Norway abolished the death penalty for regular criminal acts in 1902. The legislature abolished the death penalty for high treason in war and war-crimes in 1979. [[Reporters Without Borders]], in its 2007 Worldwide Press Freedom Index, ranked Norway at a shared first place (along with Iceland) out of 169 countries.<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20100507002549/http://en.rsf.org/press-freedom-index-2007%2C34.html Worldwide Press Freedom Index 2007], Reporters Without Borders.</ref>

In general, the legal and institutional framework in Norway is characterised by a high degree of transparency, accountability and integrity, and the perception and the occurrence of corruption are very low.<ref>{{cite web|title=Global Corruption Barometer 2013-Norway|url=http://www.transparency.org/gcb2013/country/?country=norway|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141021022145/http://www.transparency.org/gcb2013/country/?country=norway|archive-date=21 October 2014|publisher=Transparency International|access-date=17 November 2013}}</ref> Norway has ratified all relevant international anti-corruption conventions, and its standards of implementation and enforcement of anti-corruption legislation are considered very high by many international anti-corruption working groups such as the OECD Anti-Bribery Working Group. However, there are some isolated cases showing that some municipalities have abused their position in public procurement processes.

Norwegian prisons are humane, rather than tough, with emphasis on rehabilitation. At 20%, Norway's re-conviction rate is among the lowest in the world.<ref>[https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/magazine-35813470 Anders Breivik: Just how cushy are Norwegian prisons?] ''[[BBC]]''</ref>

Norway is a founding member of the United Nations (UN), the [[NATO|North Atlantic Treaty Organization]] (NATO), the [[Council of Europe]] and the European Free Trade Association (EFTA).

While Denmark, Sweden and Finland obtained membership, the Norwegian electorate rejected the treaties of accession in referendums in [[1972 Norwegian European Communities membership referendum|1972]] and [[1994 Norwegian European Union membership referendum|1994]].

After the 1994 referendum, Norway maintained its membership in the [[European Economic Area]] (EEA), an arrangement granting the country access to the [[Single market of the European Union|internal market]] of the Union, on the condition that Norway implements the Union's pieces of legislation which are deemed relevant (of which there were approximately seven thousand by 2010)<ref>{{cite web|url=http://intportal.vaf.no/hoved.aspx?m=2761&amid=49981 |title=Refleksjoner fra Brussel – Hospitering ved Sørlandets Europakontor – Vest-Agder Fylkeskommune |publisher=Intportal.vaf.no |date=4 January 2010 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130606042007/http://intportal.vaf.no/hoved.aspx?m=2761&amid=49981 |archive-date=6 June 2013}}</ref> Successive Norwegian governments have, since 1994, requested participation in parts of the EU's co-operation that go beyond the provisions of the EEA agreement.

By referendums in [[1972 Norwegian European Communities membership referendum|1972]] and [[1994 Norwegian European Union membership referendum|1994]], Norwegians rejected proposals to join the European Union (EU). However, Norway, together with [[Iceland]] and [[Liechtenstein]], participates in the European Union's single market through the [[European Economic Area]] (EEA) agreement. The EEA Treaty between the European Union countries and the EFTA countries—transposed into Norwegian law via "EØS-loven"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.lovdata.no/all/nl-19921127-109.html |title=EØS-loven – EØSl.

(EØS-loven) |publisher=Lovdata.no |access-date=14 February 2009}}</ref>—describes the procedures for implementing European Union rules in Norway and the other EFTA countries. Norway is a highly integrated member of most sectors of the EU internal market. Some sectors, such as agriculture, oil and fish, are not wholly covered by the EEA Treaty. Norway has also acceded to the [[Schengen Agreement]] and several other intergovernmental agreements among the EU member states.

The country is richly endowed with natural resources including petroleum, [[hydropower]], fish, [[forestry|forests]], and minerals. Large reserves of petroleum and natural gas were discovered in the 1960s, which led to a boom in the economy. Norway has obtained one of the highest standards of living in the world in part by having a large amount of natural resources compared to the size of the population. In 2011, 28% of state revenues were generated from the petroleum industry.<ref>"[https://2009-2017.state.gov/r/pa/ei/bgn/3421.htm Norway]," U.S. Department of State</ref>

Norway is the first country which banned cutting of trees (deforestation), in order to prevent rain forests from vanishing. The country declared its intention at the UN Climate Summit in 2014, alongside Great Britain and Germany. Crops, that are typically linked to forests' destruction are timber, soy, palm oil and beef. Now Norway has to find a new way to provide these essential products without exerting negative influence on its environment.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.cnn.com/2016/06/08/europe/norway-deforestation/index.html|title=Norway first in world to ban deforestation|author=Farida Fawzy|website=CNN}}</ref>

In 1995, the Norwegian government established the sovereign wealth fund ([[The Government Pension Fund of Norway|"Government Pension Fund – Global"]]), which would be funded with oil revenues, including taxes, dividends, sales revenues and licensing fees. This was intended to reduce overheating in the economy from oil revenues, minimise uncertainty from volatility in oil price, and provide a cushion to compensate for expenses associated with the ageing of the population.

The government controls its petroleum resources through a combination of state ownership in major operators in the oil fields (with approximately 62% ownership in [[Statoil]] in 2007) and the fully state-owned [[Petoro]], which has a market value of about twice Statoil, and [[State's Direct Financial Interest|SDFI]]. Finally, the government controls licensing of exploration and production of fields. The fund invests in developed financial markets outside Norway. Spending from the fund is constrained by the budgetary rule (''Handlingsregelen''), which limits spending over time to no more than the real value yield of the fund, originally assumed to be 4% a year, but lowered in 2017 to 3% of the fund's total value.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.regjeringen.no/en/topics/the-economy/economic-policy/economic-policy/id418083/ |title=The Norwegian Fiscal Policy Framework |publisher=Government.no |access-date=14 January 2020}}</ref>

In 2017, the Government Pension Fund controlled assets surpassed a value of US$1 trillion (equal to US$190,000 per capita),<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.nbim.no/en/|title=The fund|website=Norges Bank Investment Management|language=en-GB|access-date=4 June 2019|quote=2017 The fund's value reaches 1 trillion dollars|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181121075650/https://www.nbim.no/en/|archive-date=21 November 2018|url-status=dead}}</ref> about 250% of Norway's 2017 GDP.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.ssb.no/en/nasjonalregnskap-og-konjunkturer/statistikker/knr|title=National accounts – SSB|website=Statistics Norway|language=en-GB|access-date=14 January 2020|quote=Statistics Norway national accounts}}</ref> It is the largest [[sovereign wealth fund]] in the world.<ref>{{cite news |author=Stanley Reed |title=Norway's Sovereign Wealth Fund Ramps Up Investment Plans |url=https://dealbook.nytimes.com/2014/06/24/norways-sovereign-wealth-fund-ramps-up-investment-plans/ |quote=The fund, the world's largest sovereign wealth fund ... |newspaper=[[The New York Times]] |date=24 June 2014 |access-date=27 April 2015}}</ref> The fund controls about 1.3% of all listed shares in Europe, and more than 1% of all the publicly traded shares in the world. The Norwegian Central Bank operates investment offices in London, New York, and Shanghai. Guidelines implemented in 2007 allow the fund to invest up to 60% of the capital in shares (maximum of 40% prior), while the rest may be placed in bonds and real-estate. As the stock markets tumbled in September 2008, the fund was able to buy more shares at low prices. In this way, the losses incurred by the market turmoil was recuperated by November 2009.{{citation needed|date=September 2015}}

Other nations with economies based on natural resources, such as Russia, are trying to learn from Norway by establishing similar funds. The investment choices of the Norwegian fund are directed by [[Socially responsible investing|ethical guidelines]]; for example, the fund is not allowed to invest in companies that produce parts for nuclear weapons. Norway's highly [[transparency (market)|transparent]] investment scheme<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.nbim.no/en/transparency/|title=Transparency|website=www.nbim.no|language=en-GB|access-date=22 November 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181121103940/https://www.nbim.no/en/transparency/|archive-date=21 November 2018|url-status=dead}}</ref> is lauded by the international community.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.ft.com/content/b6e0e756-e87c-11e1-8397-00144feab49a|title=Investment: Norway's nest egg|website=Financial Times|language=en-GB|access-date=22 November 2018}}</ref> The future size of the fund is closely linked to the price of oil and to developments in international financial markets.

In 2000, the government sold one-third of the state-owned oil company Statoil in an [[Initial public offering|IPO]]. The next year, the main telecom supplier, [[Telenor]], was listed on [[Oslo Stock Exchange]]. The state also owns significant shares of Norway's largest bank, [[DNB ASA|DnB NOR]] and the airline [[Scandinavian Airlines|SAS]]. Since 2000, economic growth has been rapid, pushing unemployment down to levels not seen since the early 1980s (unemployment in 2007: 1.3%). The international financial crisis has primarily affected the industrial sector, but unemployment has remained low, and was at 3.3% (86,000 people) in August 2011. In contrast to Norway, Sweden had substantially higher actual and projected unemployment numbers as a result of the recession. Thousands of mainly young Swedes migrated to Norway for work during these years, which is easy, as the labour market and social security systems overlap in the Nordic Countries. In the first quarter of 2009, the GNP of Norway surpassed Sweden's for the first time in history, although its population is half the size.

The [[Sámi people]] are indigenous to the Far North and have traditionally inhabited central and northern parts of Norway and Sweden, as well as areas in northern Finland and in Russia on the [[Kola Peninsula]]. Another national minority are the [[Kven people]], descendants of Finnish-speaking people who migrated to northern Norway from the 18th up to the 20th century. From the 19th century up to the 1970s, the Norwegian government tried to assimilate both the Sámi and the Kven, encouraging them to adopt the majority language, culture and religion.<ref>Eivind Bråstad Jensen. 1991.

[[Separation of church and state#Norway|Separation of church and state]] happened significantly later in Norway than in most of Europe, and remains incomplete.

Until 2012 parliamentary officials were required to be members of the Evangelical-Lutheran Church of Norway, and at least half of all government ministers had to be a member of the state church. As state church, the Church of Norway's clergy were viewed as state employees, and the central and regional church administrations were part of the state administration. Members of the Royal family are required to be members of the Lutheran church. On 1 January 2017, Norway made the church independent of the state, but retained the Church's status as the "people's church".<ref>[https://kirken.no/nb-NO/om-kirken/slik-styres-kirken/kirkeordning/ny-kirkeordning-2020/ På vei mot ny kirkeordning] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171213091126/https://kirken.no/nb-NO/om-kirken/slik-styres-kirken/kirkeordning/ny-kirkeordning-2020/ |date=13 December 2017 }} Den Norske Kirke.

Most Norwegians are registered at baptism as members of the Church of Norway, which has been Norway's [[state church]] since its establishment. In recent years the church has been granted increasing internal autonomy, but it retains its special constitutional status and other special ties to the state, and the constitution requires that the reigning monarch must be a member and states that the country's values are based on its Christian and humanist heritage. Many remain in the church to participate in the community and practices such as [[baptism]], [[confirmation]], marriage and burial rites. About 70.6% of Norwegians were members of the Church of Norway in 2017. In 2017, about 53.6% of all newborns were baptised and about 57.9% of all 15-year-old persons were [[Confirmation (Lutheran Church)|confirmed]] in the church.<ref>[http://www.ssb.no/en/kultur-og-fritid/statistikker/kirke_kostra/aar Church of Norway, 2017] 4 June 2018 Statistics Norway</ref>

==== Indigenous religions ====
As in other Scandinavian countries, the ancient Norse followed a form of native [[Germanic paganism]] known as [[Norse paganism]]. By the end of the 11th century, when Norway had been [[Christianization of Scandinavia|Christianised]], the indigenous Norse religion and practices were prohibited. Remnants of the native religion and beliefs of Norway survive today in the form of names, referential names of cities and locations, the days of the week, and other parts of everyday language. Modern interest in the old ways has led to a revival of pagan religious practices in the form of ''[[Germanic Neopaganism|Åsatru]].'' The Norwegian ''[[Åsatrufellesskapet Bifrost]]'' formed in 1996; in 2011, the fellowship had about 300 members. ''Foreningen Forn Sed'' was formed in 1999 and has been recognised by the Norwegian government.

The Sámi minority retained their [[Sámi shamanism|shamanistic religion]] well into the 18th century, when most converted to Christianity under the influence of Dano-Norwegian Lutheran [[missionaries]]. Although some insist that "indigenous Sámi religion had effectively been eradicated,'<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.laits.utexas.edu/sami/diehtu/siida/christian/decline.htm |title=The Decline of the Sámi People's Indigenous Religion |last=Holloway |first=Alan |website=Sami Culture |access-date=23 March 2017}}</ref> athropologist [[Gutorm Gjessing]]'s ''Changing Lapps'' (1954) argues that the Sámi's "were outwardly and to all practical purposes converted to Christianity, but at the subconscious and unconscious level, the shamistic frenzy survived, more or less latent, only awaiting the necessary stimulus to break out into the open."<ref>{{Cite book |title=Changing Lapps: A Study in Culture Relations in Northernmost Norway |last=Gjessing |first=Gutorm |publisher=Ejnar Munksgaard |year=1954 |location=Copenhagen |page=27}}</ref> Today there is a renewed appreciation for the Sámi traditional way of life, which has led to a revival of ''[[Noaidevuohta]]''.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.tnp.no/norway/panorama/2792-shamanism-approved-as-a-religion-in-norway |title=Shamanism Approved as a Religion in Norway |publisher=Tnp.no |date=15 March 2012 |access-date=12 October 2013}}</ref> Some Norwegian and Sámi celebrities are reported to visit [[shamans]] for guidance.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.kjendis.no/2012/05/08/kjendis/sjaman/geir_kvarme/mari_maurstad/21498916/ |title=Geir Kvarme gikk til sjaman for å få balanse |publisher=Kjendis.no |access-date=22 September 2012 |date=8 May 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120715005848/http://www.kjendis.no/2012/05/08/kjendis/sjaman/geir_kvarme/mari_maurstad/21498916/ |archive-date=15 July 2012 |url-status=dead }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |author=AV: ellen kongsnes |url=http://www.aftenbladet.no/energi/Samisk-sjaman-skapte-oljefeber-2927059.html |title=Samisk sjaman skapte oljefeber |publisher=Aftenbladet.no |access-date=22 September 2012}}</ref>

[[Vaccination]] and increased treatment opportunities with antibiotics resulted in great improvements within the Norwegian population. Improved hygiene and better nutrition were factors that contributed to improved health.

The disease pattern in Norway changed from communicable diseases to non-communicable diseases and chronic diseases as [[cardiovascular disease]].

Norwegian in its two forms, [[Bokmål]] and [[Nynorsk]], is the main national official language of all of Norway.

The [[North Germanic languages|North Germanic]] Norwegian language has two official written forms, ''[[Bokmål]]'' and ''[[Nynorsk]]''. Both are used in public administration, schools, churches, and media. Bokmål is the written language used by a large majority of about 80–85%. Around 95% of the population speak Norwegian as their first or native language, although many speak dialects that may differ significantly from the written languages. All Norwegian dialects are mutually intelligible, although listeners with limited exposure to dialects other than their own may struggle to understand certain phrases and pronunciations in some other dialects.

Several [[Uralic languages|Uralic]] Sámi languages are spoken and written throughout the country, traditionally in the north and to a lesser degree in some parts of Central Norway, by some members of the Sámi people.

In the 19th and 20th centuries, the Norwegian language was subject to [[Norwegian language conflict|strong political and cultural controversies]]. This led to the development of Nynorsk in the 19th century and to the formation of alternative spelling standards in the 20th century.

Norwegian is similar to its neighbour [[North Germanic languages|Scandinavian languages]]; [[Swedish language|Swedish]] and [[Danish language|Danish]]. All three languages are to a degree mutually intelligible and can be, and commonly are, employed in communication among inhabitants of the Scandinavian countries. As a result of the co-operation within the [[Nordic Council]], inhabitants of all Nordic countries, including [[Iceland]] and [[Finland]], have the right to communicate with Norwegian authorities in their own language.<ref>{{Cite web|date=26 January 2017|title=Interesting Facts About the Norwegian Language (Norsk)|url=https://www.nordictrans.com/blog/interesting-facts-norwegian-language/|access-date=17 November 2020|website=Nordictrans.com|language=en-US}}</ref>

Students who are children of immigrant parents are encouraged to learn the Norwegian language. The Norwegian government offers language instructional courses for immigrants wishing to obtain Norwegian citizenship. With increasing concern about assimilating immigrants, since 1 September 2008, the government has required that an applicant for Norwegian citizenship give evidence of proficiency in either Norwegian or in one of the Sámi languages, or give proof of having attended classes in Norwegian for 300 hours, or meet the language requirements for university studies in Norway (that is, by being proficient in one of the Scandinavian languages).

The primary foreign language taught in Norwegian schools is English, considered an international language since the post-WWII era. The majority of the population is fairly fluent in English, especially those born after World War II. German, French and Spanish are also commonly taught as second or, more often, third languages. Russian, Japanese, Italian, [[Latin]], and rarely [[Standard Mandarin|Chinese (Mandarin)]] are offered in some schools, mostly in the cities. Traditionally, English, German and French were considered the main foreign languages in Norway. These languages, for instance, were used on [[Norwegian passport]]s until the 1990s, and university students have a general right to use these languages when submitting their theses.

The Norwegian farm culture continues to play a role in contemporary Norwegian culture. In the 19th century, it inspired a strong [[Norwegian romantic nationalism|romantic nationalistic]] movement, which is still visible in the [[Norwegian language]] and [[:Category:Mass media in Norway|media]]. Norwegian culture blossomed with nationalist efforts to achieve an independent identity in the areas of literature, art and music. This continues today in the performing arts and as a result of government support for exhibitions, cultural projects and artwork.<ref>{{cite encyclopedia|url=http://encarta.msn.com/encyclopedia_761556517_4/norway.html |title="Norway's Culture", ''Encarta'' |publisher=Webcitation.org |access-date=15 February 2014 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091028211352/http://encarta.msn.com/encyclopedia_761556517_4/Norway.html |archive-date=28 October 2009 }}</ref>

=== Human rights ===
{{main|Human rights in Norway}}
Norway has been considered a progressive country, which has adopted legislation and policies to support women's rights, minority rights, and [[LGBT rights in Norway|LGBT rights]]. As early as 1884, 171 of the leading figures, among them five Prime Ministers for the Liberal Party and the Conservative Party, co-founded the [[Norwegian Association for Women's Rights]].<ref>Aslaug Moksnes. ''Likestilling eller særstilling? Norsk kvinnesaksforening 1884–1913'' (p. 35), [[Gyldendal Norsk Forlag]], 1984, {{ISBN|8205153566}}</ref> They successfully campaigned for women's [[right to education]], [[women's suffrage]], the [[right to work]], and other gender equality policies. From the 1970s, gender equality also came high on the state agenda, with the establishment of a public body to promote gender equality, which evolved into the [[Gender Equality and Anti-Discrimination Ombud]]. Civil society organisations also continue to play an important role, and the women's rights organisations are today organised in the [[Norwegian Women's Lobby]] umbrella organisation.

In 1990, the Norwegian constitution was amended to grant [[absolute primogeniture]] to the Norwegian throne, meaning that the eldest child, regardless of gender, takes precedence in the line of succession. As it was not retroactive, the current successor to the throne is the eldest son of the King, rather than his eldest child. The Norwegian constitution Article 6 states that "For those born before the year 1990 it shall...be the case that a male shall take precedence over a female."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.stortinget.no/en/In-English/About-the-Storting/The-Constitution/The-Constitution/ |title=The Constitution – Complete text |publisher=Stortinget.no |access-date=23 July 2011 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110629190647/http://stortinget.no/en/In-English/About-the-Storting/The-Constitution/The-Constitution/ |archive-date=29 June 2011}}</ref>

In 1993, Norway became the second country to legalise [[civil union]] partnerships for same-sex couples, and on 1 January 2009 [[Same-sex marriage in Norway|Norway became the sixth country]] to legalize [[same-sex marriage]].

=== Cinema ===
{{Main|Cinema of Norway}}
The Norwegian cinema has received international recognition. The documentary film ''[[Kon-Tiki (1950 film)|Kon-Tiki]]'' (1950) won an [[Academy Awards|Academy Award]]. In 1959, [[Arne Skouen]]'s ''Nine Lives'' was nominated, but failed to win. Another notable film is ''[[The Pinchcliffe Grand Prix|Flåklypa Grand Prix]]'' (English: ''Pinchcliffe Grand Prix''), an animated feature film directed by [[Ivo Caprino]]. The film was released in 1975 and is based on characters from Norwegian cartoonist [[Kjell Aukrust]]. It is the most widely seen Norwegian film of all time.

[[Nils Gaup]]'s ''[[Pathfinder (1987 film)|Pathfinder]]'' (1987), the story of the [[Sámi people|Sámi]], was nominated for an Oscar. [[Berit Nesheim]]'s ''[[The Other Side of Sunday]]'' was nominated for an Oscar in 1997.

Since the 1990s, the film industry has thrived, producing up to 20 feature films each year. Particular successes were ''[[Kristin Lavransdatter]]'', based on a novel by a Nobel Prize winner; ''[[The Telegraphist]]'' and ''[[Gurin with the Foxtail]]''. [[Knut Erik Jensen]] was among the more successful new directors, together with [[Erik Skjoldbjærg]], who is remembered for ''[[Insomnia (1997 film)|Insomnia]]''.<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20120126134405/http://www.norway.org/aboutnorway/culture/film/A_Brief_History_of_Norwegian_Film/ "A brief history of Norwegian film"].

The country has also been used as filming location for several Hollywood and other international productions, including ''[[The Empire Strikes Back]]'' (1980), for which the producers used [[Hardangerjøkulen]] [[glacier]] as a filming location for scenes of the ice planet Hoth. It included a memorable battle in the snow. The films ''[[Die Another Day]]'', ''[[The Golden Compass (film)|The Golden Compass]]'', ''[[Spies Like Us]]'' and ''[[The Heroes of Telemark|Heroes of Telemark]],'' as well as the TV series ''[[Lilyhammer]]'' and ''[[Vikings (2013 TV series)|Vikings]]'' also had scenes set in Norway.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.norwegianfilm.com/index.php?ID=FilmsShotInNorway |title=Norwegian Film Commission |publisher=Norwegianfilm.com |access-date=22 September 2012 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120426061733/http://www.norwegianfilm.com/index.php?ID=FilmsShotInNorway |archive-date=26 April 2012 }}</ref> A short film, ''The Spirit of Norway'', was featured at [[Maelstrom (ride)|Maelstrom]] at [[Norway (Epcot)|Norway]] Pavilion at [[Epcot]] located within [[Walt Disney World Resort]] in Florida in the United States.

[[Early Norwegian black metal scene|Norwegian black metal]], a form of [[rock music in Norway]], has been an influence in world music since the late 20th century. Since the 1990s, Norway's export of [[black metal]], a lo-fi, dark and raw form of [[heavy metal music|heavy metal]], has been developed by such bands as [[Emperor (band)|Emperor]], [[Darkthrone]], [[Gorgoroth]], [[Mayhem (band)|Mayhem]], [[Burzum]] and [[Immortal (band)|Immortal]]. More recently, bands such as [[Enslaved (band)|Enslaved]], [[Kvelertak]], [[Dimmu Borgir]] and [[Satyricon (band)|Satyricon]] have evolved the genre into the present day while still garnering worldwide fans. Controversial events associated with the black metal movement in the early 1990s included several [[Church arson|church burnings]] and two prominent [[Black metal#Aarseth's murder|murder cases]].

The jazz scene in Norway is thriving. [[Jan Garbarek]], [[Terje Rypdal]], [[Mari Boine]], [[Arild Andersen]] and [[Bugge Wesseltoft]] are internationally recognised while [[Paal Nilssen-Love]], [[Supersilent]], [[Jaga Jazzist]] and [[Wibutee]] are becoming world-class artists of the younger generation.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.studyinnorway.no/sn/Living-in-Norway/Culture |title=Culture |publisher=Studyinnorway.no |date=26 March 2007 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120219033541/http://www.studyinnorway.no/sn/Living-in-Norway/Culture |archive-date=19 February 2012}}</ref>

In the 1990s and 2000s, the group maintained its popularity domestically, and has remained successful outside Norway, especially in Germany, Switzerland, France, and Brazil.

Some of the most memorable female solo artists from Norway are [[Susanne Sundfør]], [[Sigrid (singer)|Sigrid]], [[Astrid S]], [[Adelén]], [[Julie Bergan]], [[Maria Mena]], [[Tone Damli]], [[Margaret Berger]], [[Lene Marlin]], [[Christel Alsos]], [[Maria Arredondo]], [[Marion Raven]] and [[Marit Larsen]] (both former members of the defunct pop-rock group [[M2M (band)|M2M]]), [[Lene Nystrøm]] (vocalist of the Danish eurodance group [[Aqua (band)|Aqua]]) and [[Anni-Frid Lyngstad]] (vocalist of the Swedish pop group [[ABBA]]).

In recent years, various Norwegian songwriters and production teams have contributed to the music of other international artists. The Norwegian production team [[Stargate (production team)|Stargate]] has produced songs for [[Rihanna]], [[Beyoncé]], [[Shakira]], [[Jennifer Lopez]] and [[Lionel Richie]], among others. [[Espen Lind]] has written and produced songs for Beyoncé, Lionel Richie and [[Leona Lewis]], among others. [[Lene Marlin]] has written songs for Rihanna and [[Lovebugs (band)|Lovebugs]]. [[Ina Wroldsen]] has written songs for artists such as [[Demi Lovato]], [[Shakira]], [[Inna]], [[Sophie Ellis-Bextor]], [[One Direction]] and [[The Saturdays]], among others.

Norway enjoys many music festivals throughout the year, all over the country. Norway is the host of one of the world's biggest [[extreme sport]] festivals with music, [[Ekstremsportveko]]—a festival held annually in [[Voss]]. Oslo is the host of many festivals, such as [[Øyafestivalen]] and [[by:Larm]]. Oslo used to have a summer parade similar to the German [[Love Parade]]. In 1992, the city of Oslo wanted to adopt the French music festival ''Fête de la Musique''. [[Fredrik Carl Størmer]] established the festival. Even in its first year, "Musikkens Dag" gathered thousands of people and artists in the streets of Oslo. "Musikkens Dag" is now renamed ''Musikkfest Oslo''.

=== Literature ===
{{Main|Norwegian literature}}
{{See also|List of Norwegian writers}}
[[File:Hamsun bldsa HA0269.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Knut Hamsun]], author]]
The history of Norwegian literature starts with the [[Norse paganism|pagan]] [[Poetic Edda|Eddaic poems]] and [[skald]]ic verse of the 9th and 10th centuries, with poets such as [[Bragi Boddason]] and [[Eyvindr skáldaspillir]]. The arrival of Christianity around the year 1000 brought Norway into contact with European medieval learning, [[hagiography]] and history writing. Merged with native oral tradition and Icelandic influence, this influenced the literature written in the late 12th and early 13th centuries. Major works of that period include ''[[Historia Norwegiæ]]'', ''[[Þiðrekssaga]]'' and ''[[Konungs skuggsjá]]''.

Little Norwegian literature came out of the period of the Scandinavian Union and the subsequent Dano-Norwegian union (1387–1814), with some notable exceptions such as [[Petter Dass]] and [[Ludvig Holberg]]. In his play ''[[Peer Gynt]]'', Ibsen characterised this period as "Twice two hundred years of darkness/brooded o'er the race of monkeys." The first line of this couplet is frequently quoted. During the union with Denmark, the government imposed using only written Danish, which decreased the writing of Norwegian literature.
[[File:Ibsen photography.jpg|thumb|left|upright|[[Henrik Ibsen]]]]
Two major events precipitated a major resurgence in Norwegian literature: in 1811 a Norwegian university was established in [[Oslo|Christiania]]. Secondly, seized by the spirit of revolution following the [[American Revolution|American]] and [[French Revolution|French]] revolutions, the Norwegians created their first [[Constitution of Norway|Constitution]] in 1814. Strong authors were inspired who became recognised first in Scandinavia, and then worldwide; among them were [[Henrik Wergeland]], [[Peter Christen Asbjørnsen]], [[Jørgen Moe]] and [[Camilla Collett]].

By the late 19th century, in the [[Golden Age]] of Norwegian literature, the so-called "Great Four" emerged: [[Henrik Ibsen]], [[Bjørnstjerne Bjørnson]], [[Alexander Kielland]], and [[Jonas Lie (writer)|Jonas Lie]]. Bjørnson's "peasant novels", such as ''Ein glad gut'' (A Happy Boy) and ''Synnøve Solbakken'', are typical of the [[Norwegian romantic nationalism]] of their day. Kielland's novels and short stories are mostly naturalistic. Although an important contributor to early romantic nationalism, (especially ''[[Peer Gynt]]''), [[Henrik Ibsen]] is better known for his pioneering realistic dramas such as ''[[The Wild Duck]]'' and ''[[A Doll's House]].'' They caused an uproar because of his candid portrayals of the middle classes, complete with infidelity, unhappy marriages, and corrupt businessmen.

In the 20th century, three Norwegian novelists were awarded the [[Nobel Prize in Literature]]: [[Bjørnstjerne Bjørnson]] in 1903, [[Knut Hamsun]] for the book ''[[Growth of the Soil|Markens grøde]]'' ("Growth of the Soil") in 1920, and [[Sigrid Undset]] (known for ''[[Kristin Lavransdatter|Kristinlavransdatter]]'') in 1928. Writers such as the following also made important contributions: [[Dag Solstad]], [[Jon Fosse]], [[Cora Sandel]], [[Olav Duun]], [[Olav H. Hauge]], [[Gunvor Hofmo]], [[Stein Mehren]], [[Kjell Askildsen]], [[Hans Herbjørnsrud]], [[Aksel Sandemose]], [[Bergljot Hobæk Haff]], [[Jostein Gaarder]], [[Erik Fosnes Hansen]], [[Jens Bjørneboe]], [[Kjartan Fløgstad]], [[Lars Saabye Christensen]], [[Johan Borgen]], [[Herbjørg Wassmo]], [[Jan Erik Vold]], [[Rolf Jacobsen (poet)|Rolf Jacobsen]], [[Olaf Bull]], [[Jan Kjærstad]], [[Georg Johannesen]], [[Tarjei Vesaas]], [[Sigurd Hoel]], [[Arnulf Øverland]], [[Karl Ove Knausgård]] and [[Johan Falkberget]].

=== Research ===
Internationally recognised Norwegian scientists include the mathematicians [[Niels Henrik Abel]], [[Sophus Lie]] and [[Atle Selberg]], physical chemist [[Lars Onsager]], physicist [[Ivar Giaever]], chemists [[Odd Hassel]], [[Peter Waage]], and [[Cato Maximilian Guldberg]].

In the 20th century, Norwegian academics have been pioneering in many [[social sciences]], including [[criminology]], sociology and [[peace and conflict studies]]. Prominent academics include [[Arne Næss]], a philosopher and founder of [[deep ecology]]; [[Johan Galtung]], the founder of [[peace studies]]; [[Nils Christie]] and [[Thomas Mathiesen]], criminologists; [[Fredrik Barth]], a social anthropologist; [[Vilhelm Aubert]], [[Harriet Holter]] and [[Erik Grønseth]], sociologists; [[Tove Stang Dahl]], a pioneer of women's law; [[Stein Rokkan]], a political scientist; and economists [[Ragnar Frisch]], [[Trygve Haavelmo]], and [[Finn E. Kydland]].

In 2014, the two Norwegian scientists [[May-Britt Moser]] and [[Edvard Moser]] won the [[Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine]] along with [[John O'Keefe (neuroscientist)|John O'Keefe]]. They won the prize for their groundbreaking work identifying the cells that make up a positioning system in the human brain, our "in-built GPS".<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/medicine/laureates/2014/ |title=The Nobel Prize in Physiologi or Medicine 2014 |publisher=The Official Website of the Nobel Prize |access-date=2 November 2014}}</ref>

With expansive forests, Norway has long had a tradition of building in wood. Many of today's most interesting new buildings are made of wood, reflecting the strong appeal that this material continues to hold for Norwegian designers and builders.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.norway.org/aboutnorway/culture/architecture/norwegian/ |title=The evolution of Norwegian architecture |publisher=The official site of Norway |access-date=20 June 2013 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130606075917/http://www.norway.org/aboutnorway/culture/architecture/norwegian/ |archive-date=6 June 2013}}</ref>
[[File:Dalen Hotell IMG 4773.jpg|thumb|right|[[Dalen Hotel]] in [[Telemark]] built in [[dragestil|Dragon Style]], a style of design architecture that originated during the [[Norwegian romantic nationalism]].]]
With Norway's conversion to Christianity some 1,000 years ago, churches were built. Stonework architecture was introduced from Europe for the most important structures, beginning with the construction of [[Nidaros Cathedral]] in [[Trondheim]]. In the early [[Middle Ages]], wooden [[stave church]]es were constructed throughout Norway. Some of them have survived; they represent Norway's most unusual contribution to architectural history. A fine example, [[Urnes Stave Church]] in inner [[Sognefjord]], is on [[UNESCO]]'s [[World Heritage List]]. Another notable example of wooden architecture is the buildings at [[Bryggen]] Wharf in Bergen, also on the list for World Cultural Heritage sites, consisting of a row of tall, narrow wooden structures along the quayside.
[[File:Hyttklokka.jpg|thumb|The 17th-century town of [[Røros]], designated in 1980 as a UNESCO World Heritage Site, has narrow streets and wooden houses.]]
In the 17th century, under the Danish monarchy, cities and villages such as [[Kongsberg]] and [[Røros]] were established. The city Kongsberg had a church built in the Baroque style. Traditional wooden buildings that were constructed in Røros have survived.

After Norway's union with Denmark was dissolved in 1814, Oslo became the capital. The architect [[Christian Heinrich Grosch|Christian H. Grosch]] designed the earliest parts of the [[University of Oslo]], the [[Oslo Stock Exchange]], and many other buildings and churches constructed in that early national period.

At the beginning of the 20th century, the city of [[Ålesund]] was rebuilt in the [[Art Nouveau]] style, influenced by styles of France. The 1930s, when functionalism dominated, became a strong period for Norwegian architecture. It is only since the late 20th century that Norwegian architects have achieved international renown. One of the most striking modern buildings in Norway is the [[Sámi Parliament of Norway|Sámi Parliament]] in [[Karasjok|Kárášjohka]], designed by [[Stein Halvorson]] and [[Christian Sundby]]. Its debating chamber, in timber, is an abstract version of a ''lavvo,'' the traditional tent used by the nomadic [[Sámi people]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.leslieburgher.co.uk/portfolio/Other/norway.htm |title=Norwegian Architecture |author=Burgher, Leslie |publisher=Leslie Burgher website |access-date=30 May 2010 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101012161831/http://www.leslieburgher.co.uk/portfolio/Other/norway.htm |archive-date=12 October 2010 }}</ref>

It was in the 19th century that a truly Norwegian era began, first with portraits, later with impressive landscapes. Johan Christian Dahl (1788–1857), originally from the Dresden school, eventually returned to paint the landscapes of western Norway, defining Norwegian painting for the first time."<ref name="HFG">{{cite book |author= Haverkamp, Frode |title = Hans Fredrik Gude: From National Romanticism to Realism in Landscape |language = no}}</ref>

Norway's newly found independence from Denmark encouraged painters to develop their Norwegian identity, especially with landscape painting by artists such as [[Kitty Lange Kielland|Kitty Kielland]], a female painter who studied under [[Hans Gude]], and [[Harriet Backer]], another pioneer among female artists, influenced by [[impressionism]]. [[Frits Thaulow]], an impressionist, was influenced by the art scene in Paris as was [[Christian Krohg]], a realist painter, famous for his paintings of prostitutes.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.artcyclopedia.com/nationalities/Norwegian.html |title=Norwegian Artists |publisher=Artcyclopedia.com |access-date=23 July 2011}}</ref>

Of particular note is [[Edvard Munch]], a symbolist/expressionist painter who became world-famous for ''[[The Scream]]'' which is said to represent the anxiety of modern man.

Other artists of note include [[Harald Sohlberg]], a neo-romantic painter remembered for his paintings of [[Røros]], and [[Odd Nerdrum]], a figurative painter who maintains that his work is not art, but [[kitsch]].

=== Cuisine ===
{{Main|Norwegian cuisine}}
[[:Category:Norwegian cuisine|Norway's culinary traditions]] show the influence of long seafaring and farming traditions, with [[salmon]] (fresh and cured), [[herring]] (pickled or marinated), [[trout]], [[cod]]fish, and other seafood, balanced by cheeses (such as [[brunost]]), dairy products, and breads (predominantly dark/darker).

[[Lefse]] is a Norwegian potato flatbread, usually topped with large amounts of butter and sugar, most common around Christmas. Some traditional Norwegian dishes include [[lutefisk]], [[smalahove]], [[pinnekjøtt]], [[raspeball]], and [[fårikål]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.everyculture.com/No-Sa/Norway.html |title=Countries and Their Cultures, Norway |publisher=Everyculture.com |date=4 September 2010 |access-date=23 July 2011}}</ref> Some quirky Norwegian speciality is rakefisk, which is a fermented trout, consumed with thin flatbread (flatbrød, not lefse) and sour cream. And the most popular pastry among all population is vaffel. It is different from Belgian in taste and consistency and is served with sour cream, brown cheese, butter and sugar, or strawberry or raspberry jam, which can all be mixed or eaten separately.

The main attractions of Norway are the varied landscapes that extend across the [[Arctic Circle]]. It is famous for its fjord-indented coastline and its mountains, ski resorts, lakes and woods. Popular tourist destinations in Norway include [[Oslo]], [[Ålesund]], [[Bergen]], [[Stavanger]], [[Trondheim]], [[Kristiansand]] and [[Tromsø]]. Much of the nature of Norway remains unspoiled, and thus attracts numerous hikers and skiers. The fjords, mountains and waterfalls in [[Western Norway|Western]] and [[Northern Norway]] attract several hundred thousand foreign tourists each year. In the cities, cultural idiosyncrasies such as the [[Holmenkollen ski jump]] attract many visitors, as do landmarks such as Bergen's [[Bryggen]] and Oslo's [[Vigeland Sculpture Park]].

'''Grenada''' ({{IPAc-en|audio=En-us-Grenada.ogg|ɡ|r|ə|ˈ|n|eɪ|d|ə}} {{Respell|grə|NAY|də}}; [[Grenadian Creole French]]: ''Gwenad'') is a country in the [[West Indies]] in the [[Caribbean Sea]] at the southern end of the [[Grenadines]] island chain. Grenada consists of the island of Grenada itself, two smaller islands, [[Carriacou]] and [[Petite Martinique]], and several small islands which lie to the north of the main island and are a part of [[the Grenadines]]. It is located northwest of [[Trinidad and Tobago]], northeast of [[Venezuela]] and southwest of [[Saint Vincent and the Grenadines]].

Before the [[European colonization of the Americas|arrival of Europeans in the Americas]], Grenada was inhabited by the [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|indigenous]] [[Arawaks]] and later by the [[Island Caribs]].<ref name="CIA World Factbook - Grenada"/> [[Christopher Columbus]] sighted Grenada in 1498 during his [[Voyages of Christopher Columbus|third voyage]] to the Americas.<ref name="CIA World Factbook - Grenada"/> Although it was deemed the property of the [[Monarchy of Spain|King of Spain]], there are no records to suggest the Spanish ever landed or settled on the island. Following several unsuccessful attempts by Europeans to colonise the island due to resistance from the Island Caribs, [[French colonial empire|French]] settlement and colonisation began in 1650 and continued for the next century. On 10 February 1763, Grenada was ceded to the [[British Empire|British]] under the [[Treaty of Paris (1763)|Treaty of Paris]]. British rule continued until 1974 (except for a [[Capture of Grenada (1779)|period of French rule]] between 1779 and 1783). From 1958 to 1962 Grenada was part of the [[Federation of the West Indies]], a short-lived federation of [[British West Indies|British West Indian colonies]]. On 3 March 1967, it was granted full autonomy over its internal affairs as an [[associated state]].

Independence was granted on 7 February 1974 under the leadership of [[Eric Gairy]], who became the first [[List of heads of government of Grenada|Prime Minister of Grenada]] of the [[sovereign state]]. The new country became a member of the Commonwealth, with Queen Elizabeth as Head of State.<ref name="CIA World Factbook - Grenada"/> In March 1979, the [[Marxism–Leninism|Marxist–Leninist]] [[New Jewel Movement]] overthrew Gairy's government in a [[Bloodless coup|bloodless ''coup d'état'']] and established the [[People's Revolutionary Government (Grenada)|People's Revolutionary Government]] (PRG), headed by [[Maurice Bishop]] as Prime Minister.<ref>{{Citation|last=Jacobs|first=Curtis|title=Grenada, 1949–1979: Precursor to Revolution|date=2015-01-01|work=The Grenada Revolution|publisher=University Press of Mississippi|doi=10.14325/mississippi/9781628461510.003.0002|isbn=978-1-62846-151-0}}</ref> Bishop was later arrested and executed by members of the People's Revolutionary Army, prompting a [[United States invasion of Grenada|U.S.-led invasion]] in October 1983.

==Etymology==
The origin of the name "Grenada" is obscure, but it is likely that Spanish sailors named the island for the [[Andalusia]]n city of [[Granada]].<ref name="CIA World Factbook - Grenada"/><ref name=":0">{{Cite book|url=https://archive.org/details/grenadacarriacou0000cras|url-access=registration|quote=grenada name.|title=Grenada, Carriacou and Petite Martinique|last=Crask|first=Paul|date=1 January 2009|publisher=Bradt Travel Guides|isbn=9781841622743|page=[https://archive.org/details/grenadacarriacou0000cras/page/5 5]|language=en}}</ref> It carried at least two other names during the [[Age of Discovery]].

On his [[Voyages of Christopher Columbus|third voyage]] to the region in 1498, [[Christopher Columbus]] sighted Grenada and named it "La Concepción" in honour of the [[Mary, mother of Jesus|Virgin Mary]]. It is said that he may have actually named it "Assumpción", but it is uncertain, as he is said to have sighted what are now Grenada and Tobago from a distance and named them both at the same time. However, it became accepted that he named Tobago "Assumpción" and Grenada "La Concepción".<ref name=":0" />

In 1499, the Italian explorer [[Amerigo Vespucci]] traveled through the region with the Spanish explorer [[Alonso de Ojeda]] and mapmaker [[Juan de la Cosa]]. Vespucci is reported to have renamed the island "Mayo", although this is the only map where the name appears.<ref name=":1" />

===Pre-Columbian history===
Grenada was first populated by peoples from South America, possibly during the Caribbean [[Ortoiroid people|Archaic Age]], although definitive evidence is lacking.

====Later colonial period====
[[File:Eric Gairy.jpg|thumb|right|Eric Gairy, first Prime Minister of Grenada]]
In 1877 Grenada was made a [[Crown colony]]. [[Theophilus A. Marryshow]] founded the Representative Government Association (RGA) in 1917 to agitate for a new and participative constitutional dispensation for the Grenadian people.{{citation needed|date=July 2019}} Partly as a result of Marryshow's lobbying, the Wood Commission of 1921–22 concluded that Grenada was ready for constitutional reform in the form of a modified Crown colony government. This modification granted Grenadians the right to elect five of the 15 members of the Legislative Council, on a restricted property franchise enabling the wealthiest 4% of adult Grenadians to vote.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bigdrumnation.org/comments/crowncolony.html |title=From Old Representative System to Crown Colony |publisher=Bigdrumnation.org |date=1 July 2008 |access-date=19 March 2012}}</ref> Marryshow was named a [[1943 Birthday Honours#Commander of the Order of the British Empire (CBE)|Commander of the Order of the British Empire (CBE) in 1943]].{{citation needed|date=July 2019}}

===Post-independence era===
[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 183-1982-0610-101, Berlin, Besuch Regierungsdelegation Grenada, Bootsfahrt.jpg|thumb|[[Maurice Bishop]] visiting East Germany, 1982]]

Independence was granted on 7 February 1974, under the leadership of Eric Gairy, who became the first [[Prime Minister of Grenada]].<ref name="Encyclopedia Britannica - Grenada"/><ref name="Steele, pp. 35–36"/><ref name="About Grenada: Historical Events"/> Grenada opted to remain within the [[British Commonwealth]], retaining Queen Elizabeth as [[Monarchy of Grenada|Monarch]], represented locally by a [[Governor-General of Grenada|Governor-General]].

On 13 March 1979, whilst Gairy was out of the country, the NJM launched a [[bloodless coup]] which removed Gairy, suspended the constitution, and established a [[People's Revolutionary Government]] (PRG), headed by [[Maurice Bishop]] who declared himself Prime Minister.<ref name="Encyclopedia Britannica - Grenada"/> His [[Marxism–Leninism|Marxist–Leninist]] government established close ties with [[Cuba]], Nicaragua, and other [[communist bloc]] countries.<ref name="Encyclopedia Britannica - Grenada"/> All political parties except for the New Jewel Movement were banned and no elections were held during the four years of PRG rule.

===Invasion by the United States (1983)===
{{main|United States invasion of Grenada}}
[[File:Eastern Caribbean Defense Force.jpg|thumb|Members of the Eastern Caribbean Defence Force during the 1983 [[invasion of Grenada]]]]

====Coup and execution of Maurice Bishop====
Some years later a dispute developed between Bishop and certain high-ranking members of the NJM. Though Bishop cooperated with [[Cuba]] and the [[USSR]] on various trade and foreign policy issues, he sought to maintain a "non-aligned" status. Bishop had been taking his time making Grenada wholly [[socialist]], simultaneously encouraging private-sector development in an attempt to make the island a popular tourist destination.{{citation needed|date=July 2019}} Hardline [[Marxist]] party members, including [[communist]] Deputy Prime Minister [[Bernard Coard]], deemed Bishop insufficiently revolutionary and demanded that he either step down or enter into a power-sharing arrangement.

On 16 October 1983 Bernard Coard and his wife, Phyllis, backed by the Grenadian Army, led a coup against the government of Maurice Bishop and placed Bishop under [[house arrest]].<ref name="Encyclopedia Britannica - Grenada"/> These actions led to street demonstrations in various parts of the island because Bishop had widespread support from the population. Because Bishop was a widely popular leader, he was freed by impassioned supporters who marched en masse on his guarded residence from a rally in the capital's central square. Bishop then led the crowd to the island's military headquarters to reassert his power. Grenadian soldiers were dispatched in armored vehicles by the Coard faction to retake the fort. A confrontation between soldiers and civilians at the fort ended in gunfire and panic. Three soldiers and at least eight civilians died in the tumult that also injured 100 others, a school-sponsored study later found. When the initial shooting ended with Bishop's surrender, he and seven of his closest supporters were taken prisoner and executed by a firing squad of soldiers. Besides Bishop, the group included three of his cabinet ministers, a trade union leader and three service-industry workers.<ref>{{Cite book|title=The U.S. Invasion of Grenada : legacy of a flawed victory|last=Kukielski|first=Philip|publisher=McFarland & Company|year=2019|isbn=978-1-4766-7879-5|location=Jefferson, North Carolina|pages=183–84|oclc=1123182247}}</ref>{{clarify|reason=were the cabinet ministers the executors or the executees?|date=December 2018|.}}

After the execution of Bishop, the [[People's Revolutionary Army (Grenada)|People's Revolutionary Army]] (PRA) formed a military Marxist government with General [[Hudson Austin]] as chairman.

The overthrow of a moderately socialist government by one which was strongly pro-communist concerned the administration of US President [[Ronald Reagan]].

====Post-invasion arrests====
After the invasion, the pre-revolutionary Grenadian constitution came into operation once again. Eighteen members of the PRG/PRA were arrested on charges related to the murder of Maurice Bishop and seven others. The 18 included the top political leadership of Grenada at the time of the execution, along with the entire military chain of command directly responsible for the operation that led to the executions. Fourteen were [[Capital punishment|sentenced to death]], one was found not guilty, and three were sentenced to 45 years in prison. The death sentences were eventually commuted to terms of imprisonment. Those in prison have become known as 'the [[Grenada 17]]'.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.amnesty.org/download/Documents/104000/amr320012003en.pdf|title=The Grenada 17: the last of the cold war prisoners?|last=Amnesty International|date=October 2003}}</ref>

==Geography==
{{main|Geography of Grenada}}
[[File:Grenada-map.png|250px|thumb|A map of Grenada]]

The island of Grenada is the southernmost island in the [[Antilles]] archipelago, bordering the eastern Caribbean Sea and western Atlantic Ocean, and roughly {{convert|90|mi|km|order=flip|abbr=on}} north of both [[Venezuela]] and [[Trinidad and Tobago]]. Its sister islands make up the southern section of [[the Grenadines]], which include [[Carriacou]], [[Petite Martinique]], [[Ronde Island]], [[Caille Island]], [[Diamond Island (Grenadines)|Diamond Island]], [[Large Island]], [[Saline Island]], and [[Frigate Island (Grenadines)|Frigate Island]]; the remaining islands to the north belong to [[St Vincent and the Grenadines]]. Most of the population lives on Grenada, and major towns there include the capital, [[St. George's, Grenada|St. George's]], [[Grenville, Grenada|Grenville]] and [[Gouyave]]. The largest settlement on the sister islands is [[Hillsborough, Grenada|Hillsborough]] on [[Carriacou]].

Grenada is of [[volcanic]] origin,<ref name="CIA World Factbook - Grenada"/> as evident in its soil, mountainous interior, and several explosion craters, including [[Lake Antoine, Grenada|Lake Antoine]], [[Grand Etang Lake]] and [[Levera Pond]]. Grenada's highest point is [[Mount Saint Catherine (Grenada)|Mount St. Catherine]], rising to {{convert|840|m|abbr=on}} above sea level.<ref name="CIA World Factbook - Grenada"/> Other major mountains include [[Mount Granby]] and [[South East Mountain]]. Several small rivers with waterfalls flow into the sea from these mountains. The coastline contains several bays, most notably on the southern coast which is split into numerous thin peninsulas.

Grenada is home to four ecoregions: Windward Islands moist forests, Leeward Islands dry forests, Windward Islands dry forests, and Windward Islands xeric scrub.<ref name="DinersteinOlson2017">{{cite journal|last1=Dinerstein|first1=Eric|last2=Olson|first2=David|last3=Joshi|first3=Anup|last4=Vynne|first4=Carly|last5=Burgess|first5=Neil D.|last6=Wikramanayake|first6=Eric|last7=Hahn|first7=Nathan|last8=Palminteri|first8=Suzanne|last9=Hedao|first9=Prashant|last10=Noss|first10=Reed|last11=Hansen|first11=Matt|last12=Locke|first12=Harvey|last13=Ellis|first13=Erle C|last14=Jones|first14=Benjamin|last15=Barber|first15=Charles Victor|last16=Hayes|first16=Randy|last17=Kormos|first17=Cyril|last18=Martin|first18=Vance|last19=Crist|first19=Eileen|last20=Sechrest|first20=Wes|last21=Price|first21=Lori|last22=Baillie|first22=Jonathan E.

{{main|Demographics of Grenada}}
{{further|Afro-Grenadians|Indo-Grenadians|List of cities in Grenada}}
[[File:Carriacou Scene.jpg|thumb|A view of [[Carriacou]], with other Grenadine islands visible in the distance]]
A majority of Grenadians (82%<ref name="cia.gov" />) are descendants of the [[Atlantic slave trade|enslaved Africans]].<ref name="CIA World Factbook - Grenada"/><ref name="Encyclopedia Britannica - Grenada"/> Few of the indigenous Carib and Arawak population survived the French purge at [[Sauteurs]].{{citation needed|date=July 2019}} A small percentage of descendants of indentured workers from [[India]] were brought to Grenada between 1857 and 1885, predominantly from the states of [[Bihar]] and [[Uttar Pradesh]].{{citation needed|date=July 2019}} Today, Grenadians of Indian descent constitute 2.2% of the population.<ref name="CIA World Factbook - Grenada"/> There is also a small community of French and English descendants.<ref name="Encyclopedia Britannica - Grenada"/> The rest of the population is of mixed descent (13%).<ref name="cia.gov" />

Grenada, like many of the Caribbean islands, is subject to a large amount of out-migration, with a large number of young people seeking more prospects abroad. Popular migration points for Grenadians include more prosperous islands in the Caribbean (such as [[Barbados]]), North American Cities (such as New York City, Toronto and [[Montreal]]), the United Kingdom (in particular, London and [[Yorkshire]]; see [[Grenadian British|Grenadians in the UK]]) and Australia.{{citation needed|date=July 2019}}

===Languages===
English is the country's official language<ref name="CIA World Factbook - Grenada"/> but the main spoken language is either of two [[creole language]]s ([[Grenadian Creole English]] and, less frequently, [[Grenadian Creole French]]) (sometimes called 'patois') which reflects the African, European, and native heritage of the nation. The creoles contain elements from a variety of African languages, French and English. [[Grenadian Creole French]] is mainly spoken in smaller rural areas.{{citation needed|date=July 2019}}

Some [[Hindi]]/[[Bhojpuri]] terms are still spoken amongst the Indo-Grenadian community descendants.{{citation needed|date=July 2019}}

The indigenous languages were [[Iñeri language|Iñeri]] and [[Karina language|Karina]] (Carib).{{citation needed|date=July 2019}}

==Culture==
{{main|Culture of Grenada|Music of Grenada}}
[[File:GrenadaCarnival1965FeatheredHeaddresses.jpg|thumb|A carnival in 1965]]

Island culture is heavily influenced by the [[Ethnic groups of Africa|African]] roots of most of the Grenadians, coupled with the country's long experience of colonial rule under the British. Although French influence on Grenadian culture is much less visible than on some other [[Caribbean islands]], surnames and place names in French remain, and the everyday language is laced with French words and the local Creole, or Patois.<ref name="CIA World Factbook - Grenada"/> Stronger French influence is found in the well seasoned [[Spice|spicy food]] and styles of cooking similar to those found in [[New Orleans]], and some French architecture has survived from the 1700s.{{citation needed|date=July 2019}} Indian and [[Island Caribs|Carib Amerindian]] influence is also seen, especially in the island's cuisine.

[[Oil down]], a stew, is considered to be the national dish.<ref name="Gov.gd">{{cite web|url=http://www.gov.gd/articles/grenada_oil_down.html |title=Oil down – National Dish of Grenada |publisher=Gov.gd |date=5 March 2010 |access-date=19 March 2012}}</ref> The name refers to a dish cooked in coconut milk until all the milk is absorbed, leaving a bit of coconut oil in the bottom of the pot. Early recipes call for a mixture of salted pigtail, pig's feet (trotters), salt beef and chicken, dumplings made from flour, and provision like breadfruit, green banana, yam and potatoes. [[Callaloo]] leaves are sometimes used to retain the steam and add extra flavour.<ref name="Gov.gd"/>

[[Soca music|Soca]], [[Calypso music|calypso]], and [[reggae]] are popular music genres and are played at Grenada's annual [[Carnival]]. Over the years [[rap]] music became popular amongst Grenadian youths, and there have been numerous young rappers emerging in the island's underground rap scene.{{citation needed|date=July 2019}} [[Zouk (musical movement)|Zouk]] is also being slowly introduced onto the island.{{citation needed|date=July 2019}}

An important aspect of the Grenadian culture is the tradition of [[Storytelling|story telling]], with [[Folklore|folk tale]]s bearing both African and French influences.{{citation needed|date=July 2019}} The character, ''[[Anansi|Anancy]]'', a spider who is a [[trickster]], originated in West Africa and is prevalent on other islands as well. French influence can be seen in ''[[La Diablesse]]'', a well-dressed she-[[devil]], and ''[[Loogaroo]]'' (from "loup-garou"), a [[werewolf]].{{citation needed|date=July 2019}}

===Cricket===
{{see also|Cricket in the West Indies|Windward Islands cricket team}}

As with other islands from the Caribbean, [[cricket]] is the national and most popular sport and is an intrinsic part of Grenadian culture. The [[Grenada national cricket team]] forms a part of the [[Windward Islands cricket team]] in regional domestic cricket, however it plays as a separate entity in minor regional matches,<ref>{{cite web|url=https://cricketarchive.com/Archive/Teams/1/1853/Other_Matches.html|title=Other Matches played by Grenada|publisher=CricketArchive|access-date=9 August 2014}}</ref> as well as having previously played [[Twenty20]] cricket in the [[Stanford 20/20]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://cricketarchive.com/Archive/Teams/1/1853/Twenty20_Matches.html|title=Twenty20 Matches played by Grenada|publisher=CricketArchive|access-date=9 August 2014}}</ref>

The [[Grenada National Cricket Stadium]] in [[St. George's, Grenada|St. George's]] hosts domestic and international cricket matches. [[Devon Smith]], West Indies record holder to win the [[List-A cricket|List-A]] West Indian [[WICB Cup|domestic competition]] for the second time, was born in the small town of [[Hermitage (Carriacou)|Hermitage]].

In April 2007 Grenada jointly hosted (along with several other Caribbean nations) the [[2007 Cricket World Cup]]. The Island's Prime Minister was the [[CARICOM]] representative on cricket and was instrumental in having the World Cup games brought to the region. After Hurricane Ivan, the government of the [[People's Republic of China]] (PRC) paid for the new $40&nbsp;million [[Queen's Park, Grenada|national stadium]] and provided the aid of over 300 labourers to build and repair it.<ref>{{cite news |agency=Associated Press |title=Grenada: Bandleader Loses Job in Chinese Anthem Gaffe |date=8 February 2007 |work=[[The New York Times]] |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2007/02/08/world/americas/08briefs-grenadagaffe.html |access-date=5 August 2008}}</ref> During the opening ceremony, the anthem of the [[Republic of China]] (ROC, [[Taiwan]]) was accidentally played instead of the PRC's anthem, leading to the firing of top officials.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/caribbean/news/story/2007/02/070205_grendiplomatic2.shtml |title=BBCCaribbean.com &#124; Grenada goofs: anthem mix up |publisher=BBC |date=5 February 2007 |access-date=28 June 2010}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |author=Scott Conroy |url=http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2007/02/04/world/main2429938.shtml |title=Taiwan Anthem Played For China Officials |publisher=CBS News |date=3 February 2007 |access-date=28 June 2010}}</ref>

'''Guatemala''' ({{IPAc-en|audio=En-us-Guatemala.ogg|ˌ|ɡ|w|ɑː|t|ə|ˈ|m|ɑː|l|ə}} {{respell|GWAH|tə|MAH|lə}}; {{IPA-es|ɡwateˈmala|lang|ES-pe - Guatemala.ogg}}), officially the '''Republic of Guatemala''' ({{lang-es|República de Guatemala|links=no}}),<!-- {{IPA-es|reˈpuβlika ðe ɣwateˈmala}} --> is a country in [[Central America]] bordered by [[Mexico]] to the north and west, [[Belize]] and the [[Caribbean Sea|Caribbean]] to the northeast, [[Honduras]] to the east, [[El Salvador]] to the southeast and the [[Pacific Ocean]] to the south. With an estimated population of around {{#expr:{{replace|{{UN_Population|Guatemala}}|,||}}/1e6 round 1}} million,{{UN_Population|ref}} it is the most populous country in Central America and has the 11th largest national population in the Americas. Guatemala is a [[representative democracy]]; its capital and largest city is Nueva Guatemala de la Asunción, also known as [[Guatemala City]].

The core of the [[Maya civilization]], which extended across [[Mesoamerica]], was historically based in the territory of modern Guatemala. In the 16th century, most of this area was [[Spanish conquest of Guatemala|conquered by the Spanish]] and claimed as part of the [[viceroyalty]] of [[New Spain]]. Guatemala attained independence in 1821 as part of the [[Federal Republic of Central America]], which dissolved by 1841.

From the mid- to late 19th century, Guatemala suffered chronic instability and civil strife. Beginning in the early 20th century, it was ruled by a series of dictators backed by the [[United Fruit Company]] and the [[United States]] [[Federal government of the United States|government]]. In 1944, the authoritarian leader [[Jorge Ubico]] was overthrown by a pro-democratic military coup, initiating a [[Guatemalan Revolution|decade-long revolution]] that led to sweeping social and economic reforms. A [[1954 Guatemalan coup d'état|U.S.-backed military coup]] in 1954 ended the revolution and installed a dictatorship.{{sfn|Blakeley|2009|p=92}}

From 1960 to 1996, Guatemala [[Guatemalan Civil War|endured a bloody civil war]] fought between the US-backed government and [[Left-wing politics|leftist]] rebels, including [[Guatemalan genocide|genocidal massacres]] of the Maya population perpetrated by the military.{{sfn|Cooper|2008|p=171}}{{sfn|Solano|2012|p=3–15}}{{sfn|Navarro|1999}} Since a [[United Nations]]-negotiated peace accord, Guatemala has achieved both economic growth and successful democratic elections, although it continues to struggle with high rates of poverty and crime, drug cartels, and instability. {{as of|2014}}, Guatemala ranks 31st of 33 Latin American and Caribbean countries in terms of the [[Human Development Index]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://hdr.undp.org/en/content/human-development-index-hdi|title=Human Development Index (HDI) {{!}} Human Development Reports|website=hdr.undp.org|access-date=15 January 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170128091411/http://hdr.undp.org/en/content/human-development-index-hdi|archive-date=28 January 2017|url-status=live}}</ref>

Guatemala's abundance of biologically significant and unique ecosystems includes many endemic species and contributes to Mesoamerica's designation as a [[biodiversity hotspot]].{{sfn|Conservation International|2007|p=}}

== Etymology ==
The name "Guatemala" comes from the [[Nahuatl language|Nahuatl]] word ''Cuauhtēmallān'' [[:nah:Cuauhtēmallān|(nahwiki)]], or "place of many trees", a derivative of the [[K'iche' people|K'iche' Mayan]] word for "many trees"{{sfn|Campbell|1997|p=}}{{sfn|Troika study abroad programs|2006|p=}} or, perhaps more specifically, for the Cuate/Cuatli tree [[Eysenhardtia]]. This was the name that the [[Tlaxcala|Tlaxcaltecan]] warriors who accompanied [[Pedro de Alvarado]] during the [[Spanish Conquest]] gave to this territory.{{sfn|Rain Forest Wordpress|2013|p=}}

== History ==
{{Main|History of Guatemala}}

=== Pre-Columbian ===
The first evidence of human habitation in Guatemala dates to 12,000 BC. Archeological evidence, such as [[obsidian]] [[arrowhead]]s found in various parts of the country, suggests a human presence as early as 18,000 BC.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.authenticmaya.com/ancient_guatemala.htm |title=Ancient Guatemala |publisher=Authentic Maya |author=Mary Esquivel de Villalobos |access-date=29 April 2007 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070523103423/http://www.authenticmaya.com/ancient_guatemala.htm |archive-date=23 May 2007 }}</ref> There is archaeological proof that early Guatemalan settlers were [[hunter-gatherers]]. Pollen samples from [[Petén Basin|Petén]] and the Pacific coast indicate that [[maize]] cultivation had been developed by the people by 3500 BC.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://ess.geology.ufl.edu/hodell/ICDP/Leyden.pdf |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090206082017/http://ess.geology.ufl.edu/hodell/ICDP/Leyden.pdf |archive-date=6 February 2009 |publisher=University of Florida |title=Pollen Evidence for Climatic Variability and Cultural Disturbance in the Maya Lowlands |first=Barbara |last=Leyden }}</ref> Sites dating to 6500 BC have been found in the [[Quiché department|Quiché]] region in the Highlands, and [[Sipacate]] and [[Escuintla]] on the central Pacific coast.

Archaeologists divide the [[Pre-Columbian era|pre-Columbian]] history of Mesoamerica into the Preclassic period (2999 BC to 250 AD), the Classic period (250 to 900 AD), and the Postclassic period (900 to 1500 AD).<ref>{{cite web |url=http://weber.ucsd.edu/~dkjordan/arch/mexchron.html |title=Chronological Table of Mesoamerican Archaeology |publisher=Regents of the University of California : Division of Social Sciences |access-date=29 April 2007 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070406020436/http://weber.ucsd.edu/~dkjordan/arch/mexchron.html |archive-date=6 April 2007 |url-status=live  }}</ref> Until recently, the Preclassic was regarded by researchers as a formative period, in which the peoples typically lived in huts in small villages of farmers, with few permanent buildings.

This notion has been challenged since the late 20th century by discoveries of monumental architecture from that period, such as an altar in [[La Blanca]], [[San Marcos department|San Marcos]], from 1000 BC; ceremonial sites at Miraflores and [[Naranjo]] from 801 BC; the earliest monumental masks; and the [[Mirador Basin]] cities of [[Nakbé]], Xulnal, [[El Tintal]], Wakná and [[El Mirador]].

On 3 June 2020, researchers published an article in ''[[Nature (journal)|Nature]]'' describing their discovery of the oldest and largest Maya site, known as [[Aguada Fénix]], in [[Mexico]]. It features monumental architecture, an elevated, rectangular plateau measuring about 1,400 meters long and nearly 400 meters wide, constructed of a mixture of earth and clay. To the west is a 10-meter-tall earthen mound. Remains of other structures and reservoirs were also detected through the [[Lidar]] technology. It is estimated to have been built from 1000 to 800 BC, demonstrating that the Maya built large, monumental complexes from their early period.<ref name="bower">{{cite web|url=https://www.sciencenews.org/article/lidar-reveals-oldest-biggest-ancient-maya-structure-found-mexico|title=Lidar reveals the oldest and biggest Maya structure yet found|last=Bower|first=Bruce|work=Science News|date=3 June 2020|access-date=17 June 2020}}</ref>

The Classic period of [[Mesoamerican]] civilization corresponds to the height of the [[Maya civilization]]. It is represented by countless sites throughout Guatemala, although the largest concentration is in [[Petén Basin|Petén]]. This period is characterized by urbanisation, the emergence of independent city-states, and contact with other Mesoamerican cultures.<ref>

This lasted until approximately 900 AD, when the [[Classic Maya collapse|Classic Maya civilization collapsed]].<ref name="Gill 2000">{{cite book|last=Gill|first=Richardson Benedict|year=2000|title=The Great Maya Droughts|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=DRt5RnlBTq0C|publisher=University of New Mexico Press|page=384|isbn=0-8263-2774-5|access-date=6 November 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160123214943/https://books.google.com/books?id=DRt5RnlBTq0C|archive-date=23 January 2016|url-status=live}}</ref> The Maya abandoned many of the cities of the central lowlands or were killed by a drought-induced [[famine]].<ref name="Gill 2000" /> The cause of the collapse is debated, but the drought theory is gaining currency, supported by evidence such as lakebeds, ancient pollen, and others.<ref name="Gill 2000" /> A series of prolonged droughts in what is otherwise a seasonal desert is thought to have decimated the Maya, who relied on regular rainfall to support their dense population.{{sfn|Foster|2000|p=}}

The Post-Classic period is represented by regional kingdoms, such as the [[Itza people|Itza]], [[Kowoj]], [[Yalain]] and [[Kejache]] in Petén, and the [[Mam people|Mam]], [[K'iche' people|Ki'che']], [[Kaqchikel people|Kackchiquel]], [[Chajoma]], [[Tz'utujil people|Tz'utujil]], [[Poqomchi' people|Poqomchi']], [[Q'eqchi' people|Q'eqchi']] and [[Ch'orti' people|Ch'orti']] peoples in the highlands. Their cities preserved many aspects of Maya culture.

The Maya civilization shares many features with other Mesoamerican civilizations due to the high degree of interaction and [[cultural diffusion]] that characterized the region. Advances such as writing, [[epigraphy]], and the [[Maya calendar|calendar]] did not originate with the Maya; however, their civilization fully developed them. Maya influence can be detected from [[Honduras]], Guatemala, and Northern [[El Salvador]] to as far north as central Mexico, more than {{convert|1000|km|mi|abbr=on}} from the [[Geography of Mesoamerica#Maya Region|Maya area]]. Many outside influences are found in [[Maya art]] and architecture, which are thought to have resulted from trade and cultural exchange rather than direct external conquest.

==== Archaeological investigation ====
In 2018, 60,000 uncharted structures were revealed in northern Guatemala by archaeologists with the help of [[Lidar]] technology lasers. The project applied Lidar technology on an area of 2,100 square kilometers in the [[Maya Biosphere Reserve]] in the [[Petén Department|Petén]] region of Guatemala. Thanks to the new findings, archaeologists believe that 7-11 million [[Maya peoples|Maya people]] inhabited northern Guatemala during the late classical period from 650 to 800 A.D., twice the estimated population of medieval England.<ref name="NatlGeo"/> Lidar technology digitally removed the tree canopy to reveal ancient remains and showed that Maya cities, such as [[Tikal]], were larger than previously assumed. The use of Lidar revealed numerous houses, palaces, elevated highways, and defensive fortifications. According to archaeologist Stephen Houston, it is one of the most overwhelming findings in over 150 years of Maya archaeology.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.msn.com/en-sg/news/world/archaeologists-find-ancient-lost-cities-using-lasers/ar-BBNIdqB|title=Archaeologists Find Ancient Lost Cities Using Lasers|website=msn.com|access-date=8 September 2019}}</ref><ref name="NatlGeo">{{Cite web|url=https://www.nationalgeographic.com/news/2018/02/maya-laser-lidar-guatemala-pacunam/|title=This Ancient Civilization Was Twice As Big As Medieval England|date=1 February 2018|website=National Geographic News|access-date=8 September 2019}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.newsweek.com/archaeologists-find-ancient-cities-using-lasers-1145042|title=ARCHAEOLOGISTS FIND ANCIENT MAYAN LOST CITIES IN GUATEMALA USING LASERS|website=Newsweek}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-latin-america-42916261|title=Sprawling Maya network discovered under Guatemala jungle|website=BBC News}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.history.com/news/ancient-maya-structures-guatemala-lasers|title=Lasers Reveal 60,000 Ancient Maya Structures in Guatemala|last=Little|first=Becky|website=HISTORY|language=en|access-date=8 September 2019}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.yahoo.com/news/hidden-ancient-mayan-apos-megalopolis-110002872.html|title=Hidden Ancient Mayan 'Megalopolis' With 60,000 Structures Discovered in Guatemala Using Lasers|website=yahoo.com|language=en-US|access-date=8 September 2019}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.businessinsider.com/60000-lost-mayan-structures-found-beneath-guatemalan-jungle-2018-2|title=Archaeologists found thousands of hidden structures in the Guatemalan jungle – and it could re-write human history|last=Berke|first=Jeremy|website=Business Insider|access-date=8 September 2019}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.newsweek.com/hidden-ancient-mayan-megalopolis-60000-structures-discovered-guatemala-using-797865|title=HIDDEN ANCIENT MAYAN 'MEGALOPOLIS' WITH 60,000 STRUCTURES DISCOVERED IN GUATEMALA USING LASERS|website=Newsweek}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://olodonation.com/2018/09/30/archaeologists-discover-ancient-mayan-lost-city-in-northern-guatemala-using-lasers/|title=Archaeologists Discover Ancient Mayan Lost City in Northern Guatemala Using Lasers|last=Chukwurah|first=Precious|date=30 September 2018|website=Olodo Nation (Nigeria)|language=en-US|access-date=8 September 2019}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/science/2018/09/27/this-major-discovery-upends-long-held-theories-about-maya-civilization/?_ga=2.164638527.1462411402.1566373807-1089594517.1566373807&noredirect=on|title=This major discovery upends long-held theories about the Maya civilization|website=The Washington Post}}{{dead link|date=March 2020|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://bgr.com/2018/02/02/mayan-megacity-discovered-guatemala-jungle/|title=Archaeologists discovered an ancient Mayan megacity hidden in a Guatemalan jungle|last=Wehner|first=Mike|date=2 February 2018|website=BGR|language=en|access-date=8 September 2019}}</ref>

=== Colonial era (1519–1821) ===
{{See also|Spanish conquest of Guatemala|Spanish conquest of Petén}}
[[File:Pedro de Alvarado (Tomás Povedano).jpg|thumb|upright|The ''Conquistador'' [[Pedro de Alvarado]] led the initial Spanish efforts to conquer Guatemala.<ref name="Lovell05p58">Lovell 2005, p. 58.</ref>|alt=Painting of a bearded man in early 16th-century attire including prominent ruff collar, wearing a decorative breastplate, with his right hand resting on his hip and his left hand grasping a cane, or riding crop.]]

After they arrived in the [[New World]], the Spanish started several expeditions to Guatemala, beginning in 1519. Before long, Spanish contact resulted in an epidemic that devastated native populations. [[Hernán Cortés]], who had led the [[Spanish conquest of Mexico]], granted a permit to Captains Gonzalo de Alvarado and his brother, [[Pedro de Alvarado]], to conquer this land. Alvarado at first allied himself with the [[Kaqchikel people|Kaqchikel nation]] to fight against their traditional rivals the [[K'iche' kingdom of Q'umarkaj|K'iche' (Quiché) nation]]. Alvarado later turned against the Kaqchikel, and eventually brought the entire region under Spanish domination.<ref>[http://www.lienzo.ufm.edu/cms/en/home Lienzo de Quauhquechollan] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090724103204/http://www.lienzo.ufm.edu/cms/en/home |date=24 July 2009 }} digital map exhibition on the History of the conquest of Guatemala.</ref>

During the colonial period, Guatemala was an [[Audiencia Real|audiencia]], a [[Captaincy|captaincy-general]] (''[[Captaincy General of Guatemala|Capitanía General de Guatemala]]'') of Spain, and a part of [[New Spain]] (Mexico).{{sfn|Foster|2000|pp=69–71}} The first capital, Villa de Santiago de Guatemala (now known as [[Tecpan Guatemala]]), was founded on 25 July 1524 near [[Iximché]], the Kaqchikel capital city. The capital was moved to [[Ciudad Vieja]] on 22 November 1527, as a result of a Kaqchikel attack on Villa de Santiago de Guatemala.

On 11 September 1541, the new capital was flooded when the lagoon in the [[Volcanic crater|crater]] of the [[Volcán de Agua|Agua Volcano]] collapsed due to heavy rains and earthquakes; the capital was then moved {{convert|4|mi|km|0|order=flip|abbr=on}} to [[Antigua Guatemala|Antigua]] in the Panchoy Valley, now a [[UNESCO]] [[World Heritage Site]]. This city was destroyed by several earthquakes in 1773–1774. The King of Spain authorized moving the capital to its current location in the Ermita Valley, which is named after a [[Catholic church]] dedicated to the [[Virgin Mary|Virgen del Carmen]]. This new capital was founded on 2 January 1776.

=== Independence and the 19th century (1821–1847) ===
[[File:Independenciacentroamerica2.jpg|thumb|left|[[Criollo people|Criollos]] rejoice upon learning about the declaration of independence from Spain on 15 September 1821.]]

On 15 September 1821, the [[Captaincy General of Guatemala]], an administrative region of the Spanish Empire consisting of [[Chiapas]], Guatemala, [[El Salvador]], Nicaragua, Costa Rica, and Honduras, officially proclaimed its independence from Spain. Independence from Spain was gained, and the Captaincy General of Guatemala joined the [[First Mexican Empire]] under [[Agustín de Iturbide|Agustin de Itubide]].

Under the First Empire, Mexico reached its greatest territorial extent, stretching from northern California to the provinces of Central America (excluding Panama, which was then part of Colombia), which had not initially approved becoming part of the Mexican Empire but joined the Empire shortly after their independence. This region was formally a part of the [[New Spain|Viceroyalty of New Spain]] throughout the colonial period, but as a practical matter had been administered separately. It was not until 1825 that Guatemala created its own flag.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.guatemalago.com/en/home/flag |title=Flag |publisher=Guatemala Go |access-date=22 September 2013 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130926191709/http://www.guatemalago.com/en/home/flag |archive-date=26 September 2013 }}</ref>

In 1838 the liberal forces of Honduran leader [[Francisco Morazán]] and Guatemalan [[José Francisco Barrundia]] invaded Guatemala and reached San Sur, where they executed Chúa Alvarez, father-in-law of [[Rafael Carrera]], then a military commander and later the first president of Guatemala. The liberal forces impaled Alvarez's head on a pike as a warning to followers of the Guatemalan [[caudillo]].{{sfn |González Davison |2008 |p = 84-85}} Carrera and his wife Petrona – who had come to confront Morazán as soon as they learned of the invasion and were in [[Mataquescuintla]] – swore they would never forgive Morazán even in his grave; they felt it impossible to respect anyone who would not avenge family members.{{sfn|González Davison|2008|p = 85}}

After sending several envoys, whom Carrera would not receive – and especially not Barrundia whom Carrera did not want to murder in cold blood – Morazán began a scorched-earth offensive, destroying villages in his path and stripping them of assets. The Carrera forces had to hide in the mountains.{{sfn |González Davison|2008|p=86}} Believing Carrera totally defeated, Morazán and Barrundia marched to [[Guatemala City]], and were welcomed as saviors by state governor Pedro Valenzuela and members of the conservative {{ILL|Aycinena clan|es|Clan Aycinena}}, who proposed to sponsor one of the liberal battalions, while Valenzuela and Barrundia gave Morazán all the Guatemalan resources needed to solve any financial problem he had.{{sfn|González Davison |2008 |p = 87}} The [[criollo people|criollos]] of both parties celebrated until dawn that they finally had a criollo caudillo like Morazán, who was able to crush the peasant rebellion.{{sfn|González Davison|2008 |p = 88}}

[[File:Political Evolution of Central America and the Caribbean 1830 na.png|thumb|The [[Federal Republic of Central America]] (1823–1838) with its capital in Guatemala City.]]
Morazán used the proceeds to support Los Altos and then replaced Valenzuela with [[Mariano Rivera Paz]], a member of the Aycinena clan, although he did not return to that clan any property confiscated in 1829. In revenge, [[Juan José de Aycinena y Piñol]] voted to dissolve the [[Central American Federation]] in [[San Salvador]] a little later, forcing Morazán to return to El Salvador to fight for his federal mandate. Along the way, Morazán increased repression in eastern Guatemala, as punishment for helping Carrera.{{Sfn |González Davison |2008 |p = 89}} Knowing that Morazán had gone to El Salvador, Carrera tried to take [[Salamá]] with the small force that remained, but was defeated, and lost his brother Laureano in combat. With just a few men left, he managed to escape, badly wounded, to [[Sanarate]].{{sfn |González Davison |2008 |p = 91-92}} After recovering somewhat, he attacked a detachment in [[Jutiapa]] and got a small amount of booty which he gave to the volunteers who accompanied him. He then prepared to attack [[Petapa]] near Guatemala City, where he was victorious, although with heavy casualties.{{sfn |González Davison |2008 |p = 92}}

In September of that year, Carrera attempted an assault on the capital of Guatemala, but the liberal general [[Carlos Salazar Castro]] defeated him in the fields of [[Villa Nueva, Guatemala|Villa Nueva]] and Carrera had to retreat.{{sfn |Hernández de León |1959 |p =20 April}} After unsuccessfully trying to take [[Quetzaltenango]], Carrera found himself both surrounded and wounded. He had to capitulate to Mexican General [[Agustin Guzman]], who had been in Quetzaltenango since [[Vicente Filísola]]'s arrival in 1823. Morazán had the opportunity to shoot Carrera, but did not, because he needed the support of the Guatemalan peasants to counter the attacks of [[Francisco Ferrera]] in [[El Salvador]]. Instead, Morazán left Carrera in charge of a small fort in Mita, without any weapons. Knowing that Morazán was going to attack El Salvador, [[Francisco Ferrera]] gave arms and ammunition to Carrera and convinced him to attack Guatemala City.{{sfn |González Davison |2008 |p = 96}}

Meanwhile, despite insistent advice to definitively crush Carrera and his forces, Salazar tried to negotiate with him diplomatically; he even went as far as to show that he neither feared nor distrusted Carrera by removing the fortifications of the Guatemalan capital, in place since the battle of Villa Nueva.{{sfn|Hernández de León|1959|p =20 April}} Taking advantage of Salazar's good faith and Ferrera's weapons, Carrera took Guatemala City by surprise on 13 April 1839; Salazar, [[Mariano Gálvez]] and Barrundia fled before the arrival of Carrera's militiamen. Salazar, in his nightshirt, vaulted roofs of neighboring houses and sought refuge,{{sfn|Hernández de León|1959|p=48}}{{sfn|González Davison|2008|pp=122–127}} reaching the border disguised as a peasant.{{Sfn|Hernández de León|1959|p =48}}{{sfn |González Davison |2008 |pp = 122–127}} With Salazar gone, Carrera reinstated Rivera Paz as head of state.

Between 1838 and 1840 a [[Los Altos, Central America|secessionist movement]] in the city of [[Quetzaltenango]] founded the breakaway state of [[Los Altos (country)|Los Altos]] and sought independence from Guatemala. The most important members of the Liberal Party of Guatemala and liberal enemies of the conservative régime moved to Los Altos, leaving their exile in El Salvador.{{sfn|Hernández de León|1959 |p =?}} The liberals in Los Altos began severely criticizing the Conservative government of Rivera Paz.{{sfn|Hernández de León|1959 |p =?}} Los Altos was the region with the main production and economic activity of the former state of Guatemala. Without Los Altos, conservatives lost many of the resources that had given Guatemala hegemony in Central America.{{sfn|Hernández de León|1959 |p =?}} The government of Guatemala tried to reach a peaceful solution, but two years of bloody conflict followed.

In 1840, Belgium began to act as an external source of support for Carrera's independence movement, in an effort to exert influence in Central America. The ''Compagnie belge de colonisation'' (Belgian Colonization Company), commissioned by Belgian [[Leopold I of Belgium|King Leopold I]], became the administrator of [[Santo Tomas de Castilla]]{{sfn|Compagnie Belge de Colonisation|1844|p=}} replacing the failed British [[Eastern Coast of Central America Commercial and Agricultural Company]].{{sfn|Compagnie Belge de Colonisation|1844|p=}} Even though the colony eventually crumbled, Belgium continued to support Carrera in the mid-19th century, although Britain continued to be the main business and political partner to Carrera.{{sfn|Woodward|1993|p=498}} Rafael Carrera was elected Guatemalan Governor in 1844.

[[German Guatemalans|Settlers from Germany]] arrived in the mid-19th century. German settlers acquired land and grew coffee plantations in Alta Verapaz and Quetzaltenango.{{citation needed|date=March 2019}}

=== Republic (1847–1851) ===
On 21 March 1847, Guatemala declared itself an independent republic and Carrera became its first president.

[[File:Guatemala Real 1847 Silver Coin Fonrobert 7236.jpg|thumb|Proclamation Coin 1847 of the independent Republic of Guatemala]]

During the first term as president, Carrera brought the country back from extreme conservatism to a traditional moderation; in 1848, the liberals were able to drive him from office, after the country had been in turmoil for several months.{{sfn|Hernández de León|1930|p=}}{{sfn|Miceli|1974|p=72}} Carrera resigned of his own free will and left for México. The new liberal regime allied itself with the Aycinena family and swiftly passed a law ordering Carrera's execution if he returned to Guatemalan soil.{{sfn|Hernández de León|1930|p=}}

The liberal criollos from [[Quetzaltenango]] were led by general [[Agustín Guzmán]] who occupied the city after Corregidor general [[Mariano Paredes (Guatemala)|Mariano Paredes]] was called to [[Guatemala City]] to take over the presidential office.{{sfn|González Davison|2008|p=270}} They declared on 26 August 1848 that Los Altos was an independent state once again. The new state had the support of [[Doroteo Vasconcelos]]' régime in [[El Salvador]] and the rebel guerrilla army of Vicente and Serapio Cruz, who were sworn enemies of Carrera.{{sfn|González Davison|2008|pp=270–271}} The interim government was led by Guzmán himself and had Florencio Molina and the priest Fernando Davila as his Cabinet members.{{sfn|González Davison|2008|p=271}} On 5 September 1848, the criollos altenses chose a formal government led by Fernando Antonio Martínez.

In the meantime, Carrera decided to return to Guatemala and did so, entering at [[Huehuetenango]], where he met with native leaders and told them that they must remain united to prevail; the leaders agreed and slowly the segregated native communities started developing a new Indian identity under Carrera's leadership.{{sfn|González Davison|2008|p=275}} In the meantime, in the eastern part of Guatemala, the [[Jalapa]] region became increasingly dangerous; former president [[Mariano Rivera Paz]] and rebel leader Vicente Cruz were both murdered there after trying to take over the Corregidor office in 1849.{{sfn|González Davison|2008|p=275}}

When Carrera arrived to [[Chiantla]] in [[Huehuetenango]], he received two altenses emissaries who told him that their soldiers were not going to fight his forces because that would lead to a native revolt, much like that of 1840; their only request from Carrera was to keep the natives under control.{{sfn|González Davison|2008|p=275}} The altenses did not comply, and led by Guzmán and his forces, they started chasing Carrera; the caudillo hid, helped by his native allies and remained under their protection when the forces of [[Miguel Garcia Granados]] arrived from [[Guatemala City]] looking for him.{{sfn|González Davison|2008|p=275}}

On learning that officer [[José Víctor Zavala]] had been appointed as Corregidor in Suchitepéquez, Carrera and his hundred [[jakaltek people|jacalteco]] bodyguards crossed a dangerous jungle infested with [[jaguar]]s to meet his former friend. Zavala not only did not capture him, he agreed to serve under his orders, thus sending a strong message to both liberal and conservatives in Guatemala City that they would have to negotiate with Carrera or battle on two fronts – Quetzaltenango and Jalapa.{{sfn|González Davison|2008|p=278}} Carrera went back to the Quetzaltenango area, while Zavala remained in Suchitepéquez as a tactical maneuver.{{sfn|González Davison|2008|p=}} Carrera received a visit from a cabinet member of Paredes and told him that he had control of the native population and that he assured Paredes that he would keep them appeased.{{sfn|González Davison|2008|p=278}} When the emissary returned to Guatemala City, he told the president everything Carrera said, and added that the native forces were formidable.{{sfn|González Davison|2008|p=279}}

Guzmán went to [[Antigua, Guatemala|Antigua]] to meet with another group of Paredes emissaries; they agreed that Los Altos would rejoin Guatemala, and that the latter would help Guzmán defeat his enemy and also build a port on the Pacific Ocean.{{sfn|González Davison|2008|p=279}} Guzmán was sure of victory this time, but his plan evaporated when in his absence Carrera and his native allies occupied Quetzaltenango; Carrera appointed Ignacio Yrigoyen as [[Corregidor (position)|Corregidor]] and convinced him that he should work with the K'iche', Q'anjobal and [[Mam people|Mam]] leaders to keep the region under control.{{sfn|González Davison|2008|p=280}} On his way out, Yrigoyen murmured to a friend: "Now he is the king of the Indians, indeed!"{{sfn|González Davison|2008|p=280}}

Guzmán then left for Jalapa, where he struck a deal with the rebels, while [[Luis Batres Juarros]] convinced President Paredes to deal with Carrera. Back in Guatemala City within a few months, Carrera was commander-in-chief, backed by military and political support of the Indian communities from the densely populated western highlands.{{sfn|Weaver|1999|p=138}} During the first presidency, from 1844 to 1848, he brought the country back from excessive conservatism to a moderate regime, and – with the advice of Juan José de Aycinena y Piñol and [[Pedro de Aycinena]] – restored relations with the Church in Rome with a [[Concordat of 1854|Concordat]] ratified in 1854.{{sfn|Calvert|1985|p=36}}

=== Second Carrera government (1851–1865) ===
[[File:Carrerayturcios 2014-06-22 09-46.jpg|thumb|upright|Captain General [[Rafael Carrera]] after being appointed President for Life in 1854.]]

After Carrera returned from exile in 1849 the president of El Salvador, [[Doroteo Vasconcelos]], granted asylum to the Guatemalan liberals, who harassed the Guatemalan government in several different ways. José Francisco Barrundia established a liberal newspaper for that specific purpose. Vasconcelos supported a rebel faction named "La Montaña" in eastern Guatemala, providing and distributing money and weapons. By late 1850, Vasconcelos was getting impatient at the slow progress of the war with Guatemala and decided to plan an open attack. Under that circumstance, the Salvadorean head of state started a campaign against the conservative Guatemalan regime, inviting [[Honduras]] and [[Nicaragua]] to participate in the alliance; only the [[Honduras|Honduran]] government led by [[Juan Lindo]] accepted.{{sfn|Hernández de León|1930|p=}} In 1851 Guatemala defeated an Allied army from Honduras and El Salvador at the [[Battle of La Arada]].

In 1854 Carrera was declared "supreme and perpetual leader of the nation" for life, with the power to choose his successor. He held that position until he died on 14 April 1865. While he pursued some measures to set up a foundation for economic prosperity to please the conservative landowners, military challenges at home and a three-year war with Honduras, El Salvador, and Nicaragua dominated his presidency.

His rivalry with Gerardo Barrios, President of El Salvador, resulted in open war in 1863. At [[Coatepeque, Quetzaltenango|Coatepeque]] the Guatemalans suffered a [[Battle of Coatepeque|severe defeat]], which was followed by a truce. Honduras joined with El Salvador, and Nicaragua and Costa Rica with Guatemala. The contest was finally settled in favor of Carrera, who besieged and occupied [[San Salvador]], and dominated Honduras and Nicaragua. He continued to act in concert with the Clerical Party, and tried to maintain friendly relations with European governments. Before he died, Carrera nominated his friend and loyal soldier, Army Marshall [[Vicente Cerna y Cerna]], as his successor.

The Marshall called himself President of the Republic, but in reality he was the foreman of oppressed and savaged people, cowardly enough that they had not dared to tell the dictator to leave threatening him with a revolution.}}

The State and Church were a single unit, and the conservative régime was strongly allied to the power of [[regular clergy]] of the [[Catholic Church]], who were then among the largest landowners in Guatemala. The tight relationship between church and state had been ratified by the [[Concordat of 1854|Concordat of 1852]], which was the law until Cerna was deposed in 1871.{{sfn|Aycinena|1854|p=2–16}} Even liberal generals like {{ILL|Serapio Cruz|es}} realized that Rafael Carrera's political and military presence made him practically invincible.

In 1871, the merchants guild, Consulado de Comercio, lost their exclusive court privilege. They had major effects on the economics of the time, and therefore land management. From 1839 to 1871, the Consulado held a consistent monopolistic position in the regime.<ref>{{Cite book|url=http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/804741468045832887/pdf/28989.pdf|title=Inequality in Latin America: Breaking with History?|last=de Ferranti|first=David|publisher=World Bank|year=2004|location=Washington DC, USA|pages=109–122|access-date=10 December 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170818104239/http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/804741468045832887/pdf/28989.pdf|archive-date=18 August 2017|url-status=live}}</ref>

=== Liberal governments (1871–1898) ===
{{Further|Justo Rufino Barrios}}
Guatemala's "Liberal Revolution" came in 1871 under the leadership of [[Justo Rufino Barrios]], who worked to modernize the country, improve trade, and introduce new crops and manufacturing. During this era coffee became an important crop for Guatemala.{{sfn|Foster|2000|pp=173–175}} Barrios had ambitions of reuniting Central America and took the country to war in an unsuccessful attempt to attain it, losing his life on the battlefield in 1885 against forces in El Salvador.

[[Manuel Barillas]] was president from 16 March 1886 to 15 March 1892. Manuel Barillas was unique among liberal presidents of Guatemala between 1871 and 1944: he handed over power to his successor peacefully. When election time approached, he sent for the three Liberal candidates to ask them what their government plan would be.{{sfn|De los Ríos|1948|p=78}} Happy with what he heard from general [[José María Reyna Barrios|Reyna Barrios]],{{sfn|De los Ríos|1948|p=78}} Barillas made sure that a huge column of Quetzaltenango and Totonicapán indigenous people came down from the mountains to vote for him. Reyna was elected president. {{sfn|De los Ríos|1948|p = 82}}

[[José María Reina Barrios]] was President between 1892 and 1898. During Barrios's first term in office, the power of the landowners over the rural peasantry increased. He oversaw the rebuilding of parts of [[Guatemala City]] on a grander scale, with wide, Parisian-style avenues. He oversaw Guatemala hosting the first "[[Exposición Centroamericana]]" ("Central American Fair") in 1897. During his second term, Barrios printed [[bond (finance)|bond]]s to fund his ambitious plans, fueling [[monetary inflation]] and the rise of popular opposition to his regime.

His administration also worked on improving the roads, installing national and international telegraphs and introducing electricity to Guatemala City. Completing a transoceanic railway was a main objective of his government, with a goal to attract international investors at a time when the [[Panama Canal]] was not built yet.

=== Manuel Estrada Cabrera regime (1898–1920) ===
{{Main|Manuel Estrada Cabrera}}

[[File:Manuel Estrada Cabrera.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Manuel Estrada Cabrera]] ruled Guatemala between 1898 and 1920.]]
After the assassination of general [[José María Reina Barrios]] on 8 February 1898, the Guatemalan cabinet called an emergency meeting to appoint a new successor, but declined to invite Estrada Cabrera to the meeting, even though he was the designated successor to the Presidency. There are two different descriptions of how Cabrera was able to become president. The first states that Cabrera entered the cabinet meeting "with pistol drawn" to assert his entitlement to the presidency,{{sfn|Chapman|2007|p=54}} while the second states that he showed up unarmed to the meeting and demanded the presidency by virtue of being the designated successor.{{sfn|Arévalo Martinez|1945|p=42}}

The first civilian Guatemalan head of state in over 50 years, Estrada Cabrera overcame resistance to his regime by August 1898 and called for elections in September, which he won handily.{{sfn|Arévalo Martinez|1945|p=46}} In 1898 the Legislature convened for the election of President Estrada Cabrera, who triumphed thanks to the large number of soldiers and policemen who went to vote in civilian clothes and to the large number of illiterate family that they brought with them to the polls.{{sfn|Torres Espinoza|2007|p=42}}

One of Estrada Cabrera's most famous and most bitter legacies was allowing the entry of the [[United Fruit Company]] (UFCO) into the Guatemalan economic and political arena. As a member of the [[Liberalism in Latin America|Liberal Party]], he sought to encourage development of the nation's infrastructure of [[highway]]s, [[railroad]]s, and [[sea port]]s for the sake of expanding the export economy. By the time Estrada Cabrera assumed the presidency there had been repeated efforts to construct a railroad from the major port of [[Puerto Barrios]] to the capital, Guatemala City. Due to lack of funding exacerbated by the collapse of the internal coffee trade, the railway fell {{convert|60|mi|km|sigfig=1|order=flip}} short of its goal. Estrada Cabrera decided, without consulting the legislature or judiciary, that striking a deal with the UFCO was the only way to finish the railway.{{sfn|Dosal|1993|p=}} Cabrera signed a contract with UFCO's [[Minor Cooper Keith]] in 1904 that gave the company tax exemptions, land grants, and control of all railroads on the Atlantic side.{{sfn|Chapman|2007|p=}}

Estrada Cabrera often employed brutal methods to assert his authority. Right at the beginning of his first presidential period he started prosecuting his political rivals and soon established a well-organized web of spies. One American ambassador returned to the United States after he learned the dictator had given orders to poison him. Former President [[Manuel Barillas]] was stabbed to death in Mexico City. Estrada Cabrera responded violently to workers' strikes against UFCO. In one incident, when UFCO went directly to Estrada Cabrera to resolve a strike (after the armed forces refused to respond), the president ordered an armed unit to enter a workers' compound. The forces "arrived in the night, firing indiscriminately into the workers' sleeping quarters, wounding and killing an unspecified number."{{sfn|Chapman|2007|p=83}}

In 1906 Estrada faced serious revolts against his rule; the rebels were supported by the governments of some of the other [[Central America]]n nations, but Estrada succeeded in putting them down. Elections were held by the people against the will of Estrada Cabrera and thus he had the president-elect murdered in retaliation. In 1907 Estrada narrowly survived an assassination attempt when a bomb exploded near his carriage.{{sfn|de Aerenlund|2006|p=}} It has been suggested that the extreme despotic characteristics of Estrada did not emerge until after an attempt on his life in 1907.{{sfn|Arévalo Martinez|1945|p=146}}

[[Guatemala City]] was badly damaged in the [[1917 Guatemala earthquake]].

Estrada Cabrera continued in power until forced to resign after new revolts in 1920. By that time his power had declined drastically and he was reliant upon the loyalty of a few generals. While the United States threatened intervention if he was removed through revolution, a bipartisan coalition came together to remove him from the presidency. He was removed from office after the national assembly charged that he was mentally incompetent, and appointed Carlos Herrera in his place on 8 April 1920.{{sfn|Dosal|1993|p=27}}

=== Jorge Ubico regime (1931–1944) ===
{{Main|Jorge Ubico}}
The [[Great Depression]] began in 1929 and badly damaged the Guatemalan economy, causing a rise in [[unemployment]], and leading to unrest among workers and laborers. Afraid of a popular revolt, the Guatemalan landed elite lent their support to [[Jorge Ubico]], who had become well known for "efficiency and cruelty" as a provincial governor. Ubico won the election that followed in 1931, in which he was the only candidate.{{sfn|Forster|2001|pp=12–15}}{{sfn|Gleijeses|1991|pp=10–11}} After his election his policies quickly became authoritarian. He replaced the system of debt [[peon]]age with a brutally enforced [[vagrancy (people)|vagrancy]] law, requiring all men of working age who did not own land to work a minimum of 100 days of hard labor.{{sfn|Forster|2001|p=29}} His government used unpaid Indian labor to build roads and railways. Ubico also froze wages at very low levels, and passed a law allowing land-owners complete immunity from prosecution for any action they took to defend their property,{{sfn|Forster|2001|p=29}} an action described by historians as legalizing murder.{{sfn|Gleijeses|1991|p=13}} He greatly strengthened the police force, turning it into one of the most efficient and ruthless in Latin America.{{sfn|Gleijeses|1991|p=17}} He gave them greater authority to shoot and imprison people suspected of breaking the labor laws. These laws created tremendous resentment against him among agricultural laborers.{{sfn|Forster|2001|pp=29–32}} The government became highly militarized; under his rule, every provincial governor was a general in the army.{{sfn|Gleijeses|1991|p=14}}

Ubico continued his predecessor's policy of making massive concessions to the [[United Fruit Company]], often at a cost to Guatemala. He granted the company {{convert|200000|ha|acre}} of public land in exchange for a promise to build a port, a promise he later waived.{{sfn|Gleijeses|1991|p=22}} Since its entry into Guatemala, the United Fruit Company had expanded its land-holdings by displacing farmers and converting their farmland to [[banana plantation]]s. This process accelerated under Ubico's presidency, with the government doing nothing to stop it.{{sfn|Forster|2001|p=19}} The company received import duty and real estate tax exemptions from the government and controlled more land than any other individual or group. It also controlled the sole railroad in the country, the sole facilities capable of producing electricity, and the port facilities at [[Puerto Barrios]] on the Atlantic coast.{{sfn|Schlesinger|Kinzer|1999|pp=67–71}}

Ubico saw the United States as an ally against the supposed communist threat of Mexico, and made efforts to gain its support. When the US [United States declaration of war upon Germany (1941)|declared war]] against Germany in 1941, Ubico acted on American instructions and arrested all people in Guatemala of [[German Guatemalan|German descent]].{{sfn|Gleijeses|1991|p=20}} He also permitted the US to establish an air base in Guatemala, with the stated aim of protecting the [[Panama Canal]].{{sfn|Immerman|1982|p=37}} However, Ubico was an admirer of European [[Fascism|fascist]]s, such as [[Francisco Franco]] and [[Benito Mussolini]],{{sfn|Gleijeses|1991|p=19}} and considered himself to be "another [[Napoleon Bonaparte|Napoleon]]".{{sfn|De los Ríos|1948|p=98}} He occasionally compared himself to [[Adolf Hitler]].{{sfn|Shillington|2002|pp=38–39}} He dressed ostentatiously and surrounded himself with statues and paintings of Napoleon, regularly commenting on the similarities between their appearances. He militarized numerous political and social institutions—including the post office, schools, and symphony orchestras—and placed military officers in charge of many government posts.{{sfn|Streeter2000|p=11–12}}{{sfn|Immerman|1982|p=32}}{{sfn|Grandin|2000|p=195}}{{sfn|Benz|1996|p=16–17}}{{sfn|Loveman|Davies|1997|p=118–120}}

=== Guatemalan Revolution (1944–1954) ===

On 1 July 1944 Ubico was forced to resign from the presidency in response to a wave of protests and a [[general strike]] inspired by brutal labor conditions among plantation workers.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Forster|first=Cindy|title=The Time of "Freedom": San Marcos Coffee Workers and the Radicalization of the Guatemalan National Revolution, 1944–1954|journal=Radical History Review|year=1994|volume=1994|issue=58|pages=35–78|doi=10.1215/01636545-1994-58-35}}</ref> His chosen replacement, General [[Juan Federico Ponce Vaides]], was forced out of office on 20 October 1944 by a [[coup d'état]] led by Major [[Francisco Javier Arana]] and Captain [[Jacobo Árbenz Guzmán]].

=== Coup and civil war (1954–1996) ===
{{Main|1954 Guatemalan coup d'état|Guatemalan Civil War}}
{{see also|United States involvement in regime change}}
Despite their popularity within the country, the reforms of the Guatemalan Revolution were disliked by the United States government, which was predisposed by the [[Cold War]] to see it as communist, and the [[United Fruit Company]] (UFCO), whose hugely profitable business had been affected by the end to brutal labor practices.{{sfn|Streeter|2000|pp=15–16}}{{sfn|Immerman|1982|pp=48–50}} The attitude of the U.S. government was also influenced by a propaganda campaign carried out by the UFCO.{{sfn|Paterson|2009|p=304}}

U.S. President [[Harry Truman]] authorized [[Operation PBFortune]] to topple Árbenz in 1952, with the support of Nicaraguan dictator [[Anastasio Somoza García]],{{sfn|Schlesinger|Kinzer|1999|p=102}} but the operation was aborted when too many details became public.{{sfn|Schlesinger|Kinzer|1999|p=102}}{{sfn|Gleijeses|1991|pp=228–231}} [[Dwight D. Eisenhower]] was elected U.S. President in 1952, promising to take a harder line against communism; the close links that his staff members [[John Foster Dulles]] and [[Allen Dulles]] had to the UFCO also predisposed him to act against Árbenz.{{sfn|Immerman|1982|pp=122–127}} Eisenhower authorized the CIA to carry out Operation PBSuccess in August 1953. The CIA armed, funded, and trained a force of 480 men led by [[Carlos Castillo Armas]].{{sfn|Immerman|1982|pp=161–170}}{{sfn|Schlesinger|Kinzer|1999|pp=171–175}} The force invaded Guatemala on 18 June 1954, backed by a heavy campaign of [[psychological warfare]], including bombings of [[Guatemala City]] and an anti-Árbenz radio station claiming to be genuine news.{{sfn|Immerman|1982|pp=161–170}} The invasion force fared poorly militarily, but the psychological warfare and the possibility of a U.S. invasion intimidated the Guatemalan army, which refused to fight. Árbenz resigned on 27 June.{{sfn|Immerman|1982|pp=173–178}}{{sfn|Schlesinger|Kinzer|1999|pp=190–204}}

Following negotiations in [[San Salvador]], Carlos Castillo Armas became President on 7 July 1954.{{sfn|Immerman|1982|pp=173–178}} Elections were held in early October, from which all political parties were barred from participating. Castillo Armas was the only candidate and won the election with 99% of the vote.{{sfn|Immerman|1982|pp=173–178}} Castillo Armas reversed [[Decree 900]] and ruled until 26 July 1957, when he was assassinated by Romeo Vásquez, a member of his personal guard. After the rigged<ref name="Chomsky 1985 154–160" /> election that followed, General [[José Miguel Ramón Ydígoras Fuentes|Miguel Ydígoras Fuentes]] assumed power. He is celebrated for challenging the Mexican president to a gentleman's [[duel]] on the bridge on the south border to end a feud on the subject of illegal fishing by Mexican boats on Guatemala's Pacific coast, two of which were sunk by the Guatemalan Air Force. Ydigoras authorized the training of 5,000 anti-[[Fidel Castro|Castro]] [[Cubans]] in Guatemala. He also provided airstrips in the region of [[Petén (department)|Petén]] for what later became the US-sponsored, failed [[Bay of Pigs Invasion]] in 1961. Ydigoras' government was ousted in 1963 when the Guatemalan Air Force attacked several military bases; the coup was led by his Defense Minister, Colonel [[Enrique Peralta Azurdia]].

In 1963, the junta called an election, which permitted Arevalo to return from exile and run. However, a coup from within the military, backed by the [[Kennedy Administration]], prevented the election from taking place, and forestalled a likely victory for Arevalo. The new régime intensified the campaign of terror against the guerrillas that had begun under Ydígoras-Fuentes.<ref>{{cite book|last=McClintock|first=Michael|title=American Connection|year=1987}}</ref>

In 1966, [[Julio César Méndez Montenegro]] was elected president of Guatemala under the banner "Democratic Opening". Mendez Montenegro was the candidate of the Revolutionary Party, a center-left party that had its origins in the post-Ubico era. During this time rightist [[paramilitary]] organizations, such as the "White Hand" (''[[Mano Blanca]]''), and the Anticommunist Secret Army (''Ejército Secreto Anticomunista'') were formed. Those groups were the forerunners of the infamous "[[Death squad|Death Squads]]". Military advisers from the [[Special Forces (United States Army)|United States Army Special Forces]] (Green Berets) were sent to Guatemala to train these troops and help transform the army into a modern counter-insurgency force, which eventually made it the most sophisticated in Central America.<ref>{{cite book|last=Chomsky|first=Noam|title=Turning the Tide|url=https://archive.org/details/turningtideusint00chom|url-access=registration|year=1985|publisher=South End Press|location=Boston, Massachusetts}}</ref>

In 1970, Colonel [[Carlos Manuel Arana Osorio]] was elected president. By 1972, members of the guerrilla movement entered the country from Mexico and settled in the Western Highlands. In the [[Guatemalan general election, 1974|disputed election of 1974]], General [[Kjell Eugenio Laugerud García|Kjell Laugerud García]] defeated General [[Efraín Ríos Montt]], a candidate of the Christian Democratic Party, who claimed that he had been cheated out of a victory through fraud.

On 4 February 1976, a major earthquake destroyed several cities and caused more than 25,000 deaths, especially among the poor, whose housing was substandard. The government's failure to respond rapidly to the aftermath of the earthquake and to relieve homelessness gave rise to widespread discontent, which contributed to growing popular unrest. General [[Romeo Lucas García]] assumed power in 1978 in a fraudulent election.

The 1970s saw the rise of two new guerrilla organizations, the Guerrilla Army of the Poor (EGP) and the Organization of the People in Arms (ORPA). They began guerrilla attacks that included urban and rural warfare, mainly against the military and some civilian supporters of the army. The army and the paramilitary forces responded with a brutal counter-insurgency campaign that resulted in tens of thousands of civilian deaths.{{sfn|LaFeber|1993|p=165}} In 1979, the U.S. president, [[Jimmy Carter]], who had until then been providing public support for the government forces, ordered a ban on all military aid to the Guatemalan Army because of its widespread and systematic abuse of human rights.<ref name="Chomsky 1985 154–160" /> However, documents have since come to light that suggest that American aid continued throughout the Carter years, through clandestine channels.<ref>{{cite book

In 1982, the four guerrilla groups, EGP, ORPA, FAR and PGT, merged and formed the [[Guatemalan National Revolutionary Unity|URNG]], influenced by the [[El Salvador|Salvadoran]] guerrilla [[Farabundo Martí National Liberation Front|FMLN]], the [[Nicaragua]]n [[Sandinista National Liberation Front|FSLN]] and [[Cuba]]'s government, in order to become stronger. As a result of the Army's "scorched earth" tactics in the countryside, more than 45,000 Guatemalans fled across the border to Mexico.

During the first ten years of the civil war, the victims of the state-sponsored terror were primarily students, workers, professionals, and opposition figures, but in the last years they were thousands of mostly rural [[Maya peoples|Maya]] farmers and non-combatants. More than 450 Maya villages were destroyed and over 1 million people became refugees or displaced within Guatemala.

=== Since 2000 ===

Since the peace accords Guatemala has had both economic growth and successive democratic elections, most recently in 2019. In the 2019 elections, [[Alejandro Giammattei]] won the presidency. He assumed office in January 2020.

In January 2012 Efrain Rios Montt, the former dictator of Guatemala, appeared in a Guatemalan court on genocide charges. During the hearing, the government presented evidence of over 100 incidents involving at least 1,771 deaths, 1,445 rapes, and the displacement of nearly 30,000 Guatemalans during his 17-month rule from 1982 to 1983. The prosecution wanted him incarcerated because he was viewed as a flight risk but he remained free on bail, under house arrest and guarded by the Guatemalan National Civil Police (PNC). On 10 May 2013, Rios Montt was found guilty and sentenced to 80 years in prison. It marked the first time that a national court had found a former head of state guilty of genocide.<ref>

Retired general [[Otto Pérez Molina]] was elected president in 2011 along with [[Roxana Baldetti]], the first woman ever elected vice-president in Guatemala; they began their term in office on 14 January 2012. But on 16 April 2015, a United Nations (UN) anti-corruption agency report implicated several high-profile politicians including Baldetti's private secretary, Juan Carlos Monzón, and the director of the Guatemalan Internal Revenue Service (SAT).{{who|date=July 2016}}<ref name=veliz>{{cite news

A Facebook event using the hashtag ''#RenunciaYa'' (Resign Now) invited citizens to go downtown in [[Guatemala City]] to ask for Baldetti's resignation. Within days, over 10,000 people RSVPed that they would attend. Organisers made clear that no political party or group was behind the event, and instructed protesters at the event to follow the law.

She was forced to remain in Guatemala when the United States revoked her visa. The Guatemalan government arraigned her, since it had enough evidence to suspect her involvement in the "La Linea" scandal. The prominence of US Ambassador Todd Robinson in the Guatemalan political scene once the scandal broke led to the suspicion that the US government was behind the investigation, perhaps because it needed an honest government in Guatemala to counter the presence of China and Russia in the region.<ref name=porras2015>

Leaders of the political opposition have also been implicated in CICIG investigations: several legislators and members of Libertad Democrática Renovada party (LIDER) were formally accused of bribery-related issues, prompting a large decline in the electoral prospects of its presidential candidate, Manuel Baldizón, who until April had been almost certain to become the next Guatemalan president in the 6 September 2015 presidential elections. Baldizón's popularity steeply declined and he filed accusations with the Organization of American States against CICIG leader Iván Velásquez of international obstruction in Guatemalan internal affairs.<ref>{{cite news

CICIG reported its cases so often on Thursdays that Guatemalans coined the term "CICIG Thursdays". But a Friday press conference brought the crisis to its peak: on Friday 21 August 2015, the CICIG and Attorney General Thelma Aldana presented enough evidence to convince the public that both President Pérez Molina and former vice President Baldetti were the actual leaders of "La Línea". Baldetti was arrested the same day and an impeachment was requested for the president. Several cabinet members resigned and the clamor for the president's resignation grew after Perez Molina defiantly assured the nation in a televised message broadcast on 23 August 2015 that he was not going to resign.<ref name=periodico21a>{{cite news

Thousands of protesters took to the streets again, this time to demand the increasingly isolated president's resignation. Guatemala's Congress named a commission of five legislators to consider whether to remove the president's immunity from prosecution. The Supreme Court approved. A major day of action kicked off early on 27 August, with marches and roadblocks across the country. Urban groups who had spearheaded regular protests since the scandal broke in April, on the 27th sought to unite with the rural and indigenous organizations who orchestrated the road blocks.

The strike in Guatemala City was full of a diverse and peaceful crowd ranging from the indigenous poor to the well-heeled, and it included many students from public and private universities. Hundreds of schools and businesses closed in support of the protests. The ''Comité Coordinador de Asociaciones Agrícolas, Comerciales, Industriales y Financieras'' (CACIF) Guatemala's most powerful business leaders, issued a statement demanding that Pérez Molina step down, and urged Congress to withdraw his immunity from prosecution.<ref name=cacifMolina>

[[File:Guatemala Köppen.svg|thumb|Köppen climate types of Guatemala]]

Guatemala is mountainous with small patches of desert and sand dunes, all hilly valleys, except for the south coast and the vast northern lowlands of [[Petén (department)|Petén]] department. Two mountain chains enter Guatemala from west to east, dividing Guatemala into three major regions: the highlands, where the mountains are located; the Pacific coast, south of the mountains and the Petén region, north of the mountains.

All major cities are located in the highlands and Pacific coast regions; by comparison, Petén is sparsely populated. These three regions vary in climate, elevation, and landscape, providing dramatic contrasts between hot, humid tropical lowlands and colder, drier highland peaks. [[Volcán Tajumulco]], at {{convert|4220|m|abbr=off}}, is the highest point in the Central American countries.

The rivers are short and shallow in the Pacific drainage basin, larger and deeper in the Caribbean and the [[Gulf of Mexico]] drainage basins. These rivers include the [[Polochic River|Polochic]] and [[Dulce River (Guatemala)|Dulce Rivers]], which drain into [[Lake Izabal]], the [[Motagua River]], the [[Sarstoon River|Sarstún]], which forms the boundary with Belize, and the [[Usumacinta River]], which forms the boundary between Petén and [[Chiapas]], Mexico.

Guatemala's location between the Caribbean Sea and Pacific Ocean makes it a target for hurricanes such as [[Hurricane Mitch]] in 1998 and [[Hurricane Stan]] in October 2005, which killed more than 1,500 people. The damage was not wind-related, but rather due to significant [[flooding]] and resulting [[mudflow|mudslides]]. The most recent was [[Hurricane Eta]] in November 2020, which was responsible for more than 100 missing or killed with the final tally still uncertain.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Search Called Off For Hurricane Eta Landslide Victims in Guatemala {{!}} The Weather Channel - Articles from The Weather Channel {{!}} weather.com|url=https://weather.com/news/news/2020-11-09-hurricane-eta-central-america-guatemala-toll-rises|access-date=12 November 2020|website=The Weather Channel|language=en-US}}</ref>

Guatemala's highlands lie along the [[Motagua Fault]], part of the boundary between the [[Caribbean Plate|Caribbean]] and [[North American Plate|North American]] [[tectonic plates]]. This fault has been responsible for several major earthquakes in historic times, including a 7.5 magnitude tremor on 4 February 1976 which killed more than 25,000 people. In addition, the [[Middle America Trench]], a major [[subduction zone]] lies off the Pacific coast. Here, the [[Cocos Plate]] is sinking beneath the Caribbean Plate, producing volcanic activity inland of the coast. Guatemala has 37 volcanoes, four of them active: [[Pacaya]], [[Santiaguito]], [[Volcán de Fuego|Fuego]], and [[Volcán Tacaná|Tacaná]].

Natural disasters have a long history in this geologically active part of the world. For example, two of the three [[Antigua Guatemala#History|moves]] of the capital of Guatemala have been due to volcanic mudflows in 1541 and earthquakes in 1773.

Guatemala is the largest economy in Central America, with a GDP (PPP) per capita of US$5,200. However, Guatemala faces many social problems and is one of the poorest countries in Latin America. The income distribution is highly unequal with more than half of the population below the national poverty line and just over 400,000 (3.2%) unemployed. The CIA World Fact Book considers 54.0% of the population of Guatemala to be living in poverty in 2009.<ref name="cia" /><ref>{{cite web |title=Guatemala: An Assessment of Poverty |url=http://web.worldbank.org/WBSITE/EXTERNAL/TOPICS/EXTPOVERTY/EXTPA/0,,contentMDK:20207581~menuPK:443285~pagePK:148956~piPK:216618~theSitePK:430367,00.html |publisher=World Bank |access-date=9 January 2009 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100302150027/http://web.worldbank.org/WBSITE/EXTERNAL/TOPICS/EXTPOVERTY/EXTPA/0,,contentMDK:20207581~menuPK:443285~pagePK:148956~piPK:216618~theSitePK:430367,00.html |archive-date=2 March 2010 |url-status=live  }}</ref>

In 2010, the [[Guatemalan economy]] grew by 3%, recovering gradually from the 2009 crisis, as a result of the falling demands from the United States and other [[Central American]] markets and the slowdown in foreign investment in the middle of the [[Global recession of 2009|global recession]].<ref>[http://www.deguate.com/infocentros/ecofin/guatemala/economia/indicadores-economicos/producto-interno-bruto.php El Producto Interno Bruto de Guatemala] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150703215613/http://www.deguate.com/infocentros/ecofin/guatemala/economia/indicadores-economicos/producto-interno-bruto.php |date=3 July 2015 }} ''DeGuate''</ref>

[[Remittance]]s from Guatemalans living in United States now constitute the largest single source of foreign income (two-thirds of exports and one tenth of GDP).<ref name="cia" />

Some of Guatemala's main exports are fruits, vegetables, flowers, handicrafts, cloths and others. In the face of a rising demand for [[biofuel]]s, the country is growing and exporting an increasing amount of raw materials for biofuel production, especially [[sugar cane]] and [[palm oil]]. Critics say that this development leads to higher prices for [[staple food]]s like corn, a major ingredient in the Guatemalan diet. As a consequence of the subsidization of US American corn, Guatemala imports nearly half of its corn from the United States that is using 40 percent of its crop harvest for biofuel production.<ref>[https://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/06/science/earth/in-fields-and-markets-guatemalans-feels-squeeze-of-biofuel-demand.html As Biofuel Demands Grows, So Do Guatemala's Hunger Pangs] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130108075322/http://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/06/science/earth/in-fields-and-markets-guatemalans-feels-squeeze-of-biofuel-demand.html |date=8 January 2013 }}.

Gross Domestic Product (GDP) in [[purchasing power parity]] (PPP) in 2010 was estimated at US$70.15 billion. The service sector is the largest component of GDP at 63%, followed by the industry sector at 23.8% and the agriculture sector at 13.2% (2010 est.). Mines produce gold, silver, zinc, cobalt and nickel.<ref>Dan Oancea [http://magazine.mining.com/Issues/0901/MiningCentralAmerica.pdf Mining In Central America]. Mining Magazine.

Organic coffee, sugar, textiles, fresh vegetables, and bananas are the country's main exports. Inflation was 3.9% in 2010.

The 1996 peace accords that ended the decades-long civil war removed a major obstacle to foreign investment. Tourism has become an increasing source of revenue for Guatemala thanks to the new foreign investment.

In March 2006, Guatemala's congress ratified the [[Dominican Republic-Central America Free Trade Agreement|Dominican Republic&nbsp;– Central American Free Trade Agreement (DR-CAFTA)]] between several Central American nations and the United States.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://web.amnesty.org/report2006/gtm-summary-eng |title=Guatemala Report 2006: Summary Review |access-date=15 January 2007 |url-status=bot: unknown |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070208022731/http://web.amnesty.org/report2006/gtm-summary-eng |archive-date=8 February 2007 }} ''Amnesty International'', 2006.

=== Tourism ===
{{main|Tourism in Guatemala}}
Tourism has become one of the main drivers of the economy, with tourism estimated at $1.8 billion to the economy in 2008. Guatemala receives around two million tourists annually. In recent years, there has been an increase in the number of cruise ships visiting Guatemalan seaports, leading to higher tourist numbers. Tourist destinations include Mayan archaeological sites (e.g., [[Tikal]] in the Peten, Quiriguá in Izabal, Iximche in Tecpan Chimaltenango and [[Guatemala City]]), natural attractions (e.g., [[Lake Atitlán]] and [[Semuc Champey]]) and historical sites such as the colonial city of [[Antigua Guatemala]], which is recognized as a UNESCO Cultural Heritage site.

Guatemala is populated by a variety of ethnic, cultural, racial, and linguistic groups. According to the 2018 Census conducted by the [[National Institute of Statistics (Guatemala)|National Institute of Statistics (INE)]], 56% of the population is [[Ladino people|Ladino]] reflecting mixed indigenous and European heritage.<ref name="ReferenceA">https://www.censopoblacion.gt/dondeestamos</ref> Indigenous Guatemalans are 43.6% of the national population, which is one of the largest percentages in Latin America, behind only Peru and Bolivia. Most indigenous Guatemalans (41.7% of the national population) are of the [[Maya people]], namely [[K'iche' people|K'iche']] (11.0% of the total population), [[Q'eqchi' people|Q'eqchi]] (8.3%), [[Kaqchikel people|Kaqchikel]] (7.8%), [[Mam people|Mam]] (5.2%), and "other [[Maya peoples|Maya]]" (7.6%). 2% of the national population is indigenous non-Maya. 1.8% of the population is Xinca (mesoamerican), and 0.1% of the population is Garifuna (African/Carib mix).<ref name="ReferenceA"/>

[[White people|White]] Guatemalans of European descent, also called [[Criollo people|Criollo]], are not differentiated from Ladinos (mixed-race) individuals in the Guatemalan census.<ref name="ReferenceA"/> Most are descendants of German and Spanish settlers, and others derive from Italians, British, French, Swiss, Belgians, Dutch, Russians and Danish. German settlers are credited with bringing the tradition of Christmas trees to Guatemala.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.urbanext.uiuc.edu/trees/traditions-world.html|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060905053744/http://www.urbanext.uiuc.edu/trees/traditions-world.html|url-status=dead|title=History of the Christmas Tree|archive-date=5 September 2006}}</ref>

The population includes about 110,000 Salvadorans.

[[Afro-Guatemalan]]s and [[mulatto]]s descended primarily from banana plantation workers.

Guatemala's sole official language is Spanish, spoken by 93 percent of the population as either the first or second language.

Twenty-one [[Mayan languages]] are spoken, especially in rural areas, as well as two non-Mayan [[Amerindian]] languages: [[Xinca language|Xinca]], which is indigenous to the country, and [[Garifuna language|Garifuna]], an [[Arawakan]] language spoken on the Caribbean coast.

=== Indigenous integration and bilingual education ===

Throughout the 20th century there have been many developments in the integration of [[Mayan languages]] into the Guatemalan society and educational system. Originating from political reasons, these processes have aided the revival of some Mayan languages and advanced bilingual education in the country.

In 1945, in order to overcome "the Indian problem", the Guatemalan government founded The Institute Indigents ta National (NH), the purpose of which was to teach literacy to Mayan children in their mother tongue instead of Spanish, to prepare the ground for later assimilation of the latter. The teaching of literacy in the first language, which received support from the UN, significantly advanced in 1952, when the SIL (Summer Institute of Linguistics), located in Dallas, Texas, partnered with the Guatemalan Ministry of Education; within 2 years, numerous written works in Mayan languages had been printed and published, and vast advancement was done in the translation of the New Testament. Further efforts to integrate the indigenous into the Ladino<ref>Heimberger, Janet L. Language and Ethnicity: Multiple Literacies in Context, Language Education in Guatemala. ''Bilingual Research Journal''. Vol. 30, Issue 1, pp. 65–86, 2006.</ref> society were made in the following years, including the invention of a special alphabet to assist Mayan students transition to Spanish, and bilingual education in the Q'eqchi' area. When Spanish became the official language of Guatemala in 1965, the government started several programs, such as the Bilingual [[Castellanización|Castellanizacion]] Program and the Radiophonic Schools, to accelerate the move of Mayan students to Spanish. Unintentionally, the efforts to integrate the indigenous using language, especially the new alphabet, gave institutions tools to use Mayan tongues in schools, and while improving Mayan children's learning, they left them unequipped to learn in a solely Spanish environment. So, an additional expansion of bilingual education took place in 1980, when an experimental program in which children were to be instructed in their mother tongue until they are fluent enough in Spanish was created. The program proved successful when the students of the pilot showed higher academic achievements than the ones in the Spanish-only control schools. In 1987, when the pilot was to finish, bilingual education was made official in Guatemala.

[[Christianity]] continues to remain strong and vital for the life of [[Demographics of Guatemala|Guatemalan society]], but its composition has changed over generations of social and political unrest. [[Roman Catholicism]], introduced by the Spanish during the colonial era, remains the largest denomination or church, accounting for 48.4% of the population {{As of|2007|lc=y}}. [[Protestants]], most of them [[Evangelicalism|Evangelical]] (most Protestants are called ''Evangelicos'' in Latin America) in a wide number of different denominations, made up 33.7% of the population at that time, followed by 1.6% in other religions (such as [[Jews in Guatemala|Judaism]], [[Islam in Guatemala|Islam]], and [[Buddhism]]), and 16.1% claiming no religious affiliation. A more recent 2012 survey reveals Catholics at 47.6%, Protestants at 38.2%, other religions at 2.6%, and the non-religious at 11.6%.

Since the 1970s, and particularly since the 1990s, Guatemala has experienced the rapid growth of Evangelical Protestantism, whose adherents currently form more than 38% of the population, and still growing, in different denominations.

Over the past two decades, particularly since the end of the civil war, Guatemala has seen heightened missionary activity. Protestant denominations have grown markedly in recent decades, chiefly [[Evangelicalism|Evangelical]] and [[Pentecostal]] varieties; growth is particularly strong among the ethnic Maya population, with the [[National Evangelical Presbyterian Church of Guatemala]] maintaining 11 indigenous-language presbyteries. [[The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints]] has grown from 40,000 members in 1984 to 164,000 in 1998, and continues to expand.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/temples/list?lang=eng |title=Quetzaltenango Guatemala |publisher=churchofjesuschrist.org |access-date=3 February 2015 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://churchofjesuschristtemples.org/quetzaltenango-guatemala-temple/ |title=Quetzaltenango Guatemala LDS (Mormon) Temple |publisher=Ldschurchtemples.com |access-date=3 February 2015 }}</ref>

=== Immigration ===
{{main|Immigration to Guatemala}}
During the colonial era Guatemala received immigrants (settlers) only from Spain. Subsequently, Guatemala received waves of immigration from Europe in the mid 19th century and early 20th century.{{clarify|date=June 2015}} Primarily from Germany, these immigrants installed coffee and cardamom [[fincas]] in [[Alta Verapaz]], [[Zacapa]], [[Quetzaltenango]], [[Baja Verapaz]] and [[Izabal Department|Izabal]]. To a lesser extent people also arrived from Spain, France, Belgium, England, Italy, Sweden, etc.

Many European immigrants to Guatemala were politicians, refugees, and entrepreneurs as well as families looking to settle. Up to 1950 Guatemala was the Central American country that received the most immigrants, behind [[Costa Rica]], and large numbers of immigrants are still received today.{{clarify|date=June 2015}}
Since the 1890s there have been small communities of Asians (in particular from [[Korea]], China, Japan, [[Singapore]], and the [[Philippines]]) but in recent decades this has been growing. Also, beginning with the [[First World War]], the immigrant population is being strengthened by [[Jewish]] immigration.

During the second half of the twentieth century, Latin American immigration grew in Guatemala, particularly from other [[Central American]] countries, Mexico, Cuba, and Argentina, although most of these immigrants stayed only temporarily before going to their final destinations in the United States.{{citation needed|date=November 2018}}

=== Education ===
{{Main|Education in Guatemala}}
74.5% of the population aged 15 and over is literate, the lowest [[literacy]] rate in Central America. Guatemala has a plan to increase literacy over the next 20 years.<ref>[http://stats.uis.unesco.org/unesco/TableViewer/document.aspx?ReportId=121&IF_Language=eng&BR_Country=3200&BR_Region=40520 Education (all levels) profile&nbsp;– Guatemala] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120112213255/http://stats.uis.unesco.org/unesco/TableViewer/document.aspx?ReportId=121&IF_Language=eng&BR_Country=3200&BR_Region=40520 |date=12 January 2012 }}. UNESCO Institute for Statistics. Retrieved on 2 January 2012.</ref>

The government runs a number of public elementary and secondary-level schools, as [[youth in Guatemala]] do not fully participate in education. These schools are free, though the cost of uniforms, books, supplies, and transportation makes them less accessible to the poorer segments of society and significant numbers of poor children do not attend school.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.dandc.eu/en/article/poverty-corruption-and-racism-guatemalas-primary-schools-reflect-countrys-social-problems|title=Development + Cooperation: Guatemala's Social Problems - "Free - but still too expensive"|publisher=Development + Cooperation: D+C|access-date=6 January 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190106210451/https://www.dandc.eu/en/article/poverty-corruption-and-racism-guatemalas-primary-schools-reflect-countrys-social-problems|archive-date=6 January 2019|url-status=live}}</ref> Many middle and upper-class children go to private schools. Guatemala has one public university (USAC or [[Universidad de San Carlos de Guatemala]]), and fourteen private ones (see [[List of universities in Guatemala]]). USAC was the first university in Guatemala and one of the first Universities of America.

Organizations such as [[Child Aid]], [[Pueblo a Pueblo]], and [[Common Hope]], which train teachers in villages throughout the Central Highlands region, are working to improve educational outcomes for children. Lack of training for rural teachers is one of the key contributors to Guatemala's low literacy rates.

Guatemala City is home to many of the nation's libraries and museums, including the National Archives, the National Library, and the Museum of Archeology and Ethnology, which has an extensive collection of Maya artifacts. It also boasts private museums such as the [[Ixchel Museum of Indigenous Textiles and Clothing]] and the [[Museo Popol Vuh]], which focuses on Maya archaeology. Both these museums are housed on the [[Universidad Francisco Marroquín]] campus. Most of the 329 municipalities in the country have at least a small museum.

=== Art ===
Guatemala has produced many indigenous artists who follow centuries-old Pre-Columbian traditions. Reflecting Guatemala's colonial and post-colonial history, encounters with multiple global art movements also have produced a wealth of artists who have combined the traditional [[Primitivism|primitivist]] or [[Naïve art|naive aesthetic]] with European, North American, and other traditions.

The [[Escuela Nacional de Artes Plásticas "Rafael Rodríguez Padilla"]] is Guatemala's leading art school, and several leading indigenous artists, also graduates of that school, have work in the permanent collection of the [[Museo Nacional de Arte Moderno "Carlos Mérida"|Museo Nacional de Arte Moderno]] in the capital city.

Many traditional foods in Guatemalan cuisine are based on Mayan cuisine and prominently feature [[maize]], [[Chili pepper|chilies]] and [[Black turtle bean|black beans]] as key ingredients. Traditional dishes also include a variety of stews including Kak'ik ''(Kak-ik)'', which is a tomato-based stew with [[Turkey (bird)|turkey]], pepian, and [[cocido]]. Guatemala is also known for its ''[[Mexican street food|antojitos]]'', which include small [[tamale]]s called ''chuchitos'', fried [[Cooking banana|plantains]], and [[Tostada (tortilla)|tostadas]] with [[tomato sauce]], [[guacamole]] or black beans. Certain foods are also commonly eaten on certain days of the week; for example, a popular custom is to eat ''paches'' (a kind of tamale made from potatoes) on Thursday. Certain dishes are also associated with special occasions, such as [[fiambre]] for [[All Saints' Day]] on 1 November, or tamales and ''ponche'' ([[Punch (drink)|fruit punch]]), which are both very common around Christmas.

==== Football ====
{{Main|Football in Guatemala}}
[[Association football|Football]] is the most popular sport in Guatemala and its [[Guatemala national football team|national team]] has appeared in 18 editions of the [[CONCACAF Championship]], winning it once, in [[1967 CONCACAF Championship|1967]]. However, the team has failed to qualify to a [[FIFA World Cup]] so far. Established in 1919, the [[National Football Federation of Guatemala]] organizes the country's [[Liga Nacional de Fútbol de Guatemala|national league]] and its lower-level competitions.

==== Futsal ====

[[Futsal]] is probably the most successful [[team sport]] in Guatemala. Its [[Guatemala national futsal team|national team]] won the [[2008 CONCACAF Futsal Championship]] as hosts. It was also the runner-up in [[2012 CONCACAF Futsal Championship|2012]] as hosts and won the bronze medal in [[2016 CONCACAF Futsal Championship|2016]].

Guatemala participated for the first time in the [[FIFA Futsal World Cup]] in [[2000 FIFA Futsal World Cup|2000]], as hosts, and has played in every competition from [[2008 FIFA Futsal World Cup|2008]] onwards. It has never passed the first round. It has also participated in every [[Grand Prix de Futsal]] since [[2009 Grand Prix de Futsal|2009]], reaching the semifinals in [[2014 Grand Prix de Futsal|2014]].

==== Olympics ====
{{Further|Guatemala at the Olympics}}
The [[Guatemalan Olympic Committee]] was founded in 1947 and recognized by the [[International Olympic Committee]] that same year.

It takes up 97% of the Lucayan Archipelago's land area and is home to 88% of the archipelago's population. The [[archipelagic state]] consists of more than 700 [[island]]s, [[cay]]s, and [[islet]]s in the [[Atlantic Ocean]], and is located north of [[Cuba]] and northwest of the island of [[Hispaniola]] (split between [[Haiti]] and the [[Dominican Republic]]) and the [[Turks and Caicos Islands]], southeast of the [[United States|US]] state of [[Florida]], and east of the [[Florida Keys]]. The capital is [[Nassau, Bahamas|Nassau]] on the island of [[New Providence]]. The [[Royal Bahamas Defence Force]] describes The Bahamas' territory as encompassing {{convert|180000|sqmi|km2|order=flip|sigfig=2|abbr=on}} of ocean space.

The Bahamas were inhabited by the [[Lucayan people|Lucayans]], a branch of the [[Arawakan]]-speaking [[Taíno people]], for many centuries.<ref name="CIA World Factbook – The Bahamas">{{cite web |url=https://www.cia.gov/the-world-factbook/countries/bahamas-the/ |title=CIA World Factbook – The Bahamas|access-date= 21 July 2019}}</ref> [[Christopher Columbus|Columbus]] was the first European to see the islands, making his first landfall in the '[[New World]]' in 1492. Later, the [[Spain|Spanish]] shipped the native Lucayans to and enslaved them on [[Hispaniola]], after which the Bahama islands were mostly deserted from 1513 until 1648, when [[Kingdom of England|English]] colonists from [[Bermuda]] settled on the island of [[Eleuthera]].

The Bahamas became a [[Kingdom of Great Britain|British]] [[crown colony]] in 1718, when the British clamped down on [[piracy]]. After the [[American Revolutionary War]], the Crown resettled thousands of [[American Loyalists]] to The Bahamas; they took enslaved people with them and established [[plantation]]s on land grants. African enslaved people and their descendants constituted the majority of the population from this period on. The slave trade was abolished by the British in 1807; slavery in The Bahamas was abolished in 1834. Subsequently, The Bahamas became a haven for freed African slaves. Africans liberated from illegal slave ships were resettled on the islands by the [[Royal Navy]], while some [[Slavery in North America|North American slaves]] and [[Seminole]]s escaped to The Bahamas from Florida. Bahamians were even known to recognise the freedom of enslaved people carried by the ships of other nations which reached The Bahamas.

==Etymology==
The name ''Bahamas'' is most likely derived from either the [[Taíno language|Taíno]] ''{{lang|tnq|ba ha ma}}'' ("big upper middle land"), which was a term for the region used by the indigenous people,<ref>{{cite book |title=Bahama Saga: The epic story of The Bahama Islands |page=47 |author=Peter Barratt |year=2004 }}</ref> or possibly from the [[Spanish language|Spanish]] ''{{lang|es|baja mar}}'' ("shallow water or sea" or "low tide") reflecting the shallow waters of the area. Alternatively, it may originate from ''{{lang|tnq|[[Guanahani]]}}'', a local name of unclear meaning.<ref>{{OEtymD|bahamas}}</ref>

The word ''The'' constitutes an integral part of the short form of the name and is, therefore, capitalised. The Constitution of the Commonwealth of The Bahamas, the country's fundamental law, capitalises the "T" in "The Bahamas".<ref>Government of the Bahamas [https://www.bahamas.gov.bs/wps/portal/public/About%20The%20Bahamas/Constitution/!ut/p/b1/vVPLdqJAEP2WfMCEbugHLDvyEJXmjcCGoxjBR4MKavDrx8zMIplzJtlM0r3q07fqVt1bJeVSKuXN4rKpFv2mbRb713dOCgVYDmNIdSwMCLBjb8Y8OpZdiO-A7AMAAr_jLRc5xv3bNUcM2NBAY8XXFRACaS6lUSa_6J1dWXawPvjdlgUHmyQ1X-n2eXaGm8pDvWAjXngpfomxq0HlXHal4CdhWEorGw2hKaZN88RCoybHS83j56ZuT5d9lEZDuH7BnXIaYx5TS8jVFKXzOnPYygfE6IrjVQSJmFomrxVe50cnSkvNxEPVHkjdreJzTzLjDLq9eTTzJVi6bao6qfYMnnD18PCnf_CPw8Bn-k2kfLMUj9dSPIJHqEAKZUgRpVTDGJK7PPmHGabyJ4BXB34BPigxuwPomwxRAu4mARaE0Acqh1IkpQAV4XY42LfdLdiCq8xnJXD0wIM7AKNomfDIGhw-4eEpcGAMbmGUT5ybD7tdNfQ88lZJED8xnS1gfPmb0JUj7U44gmQa4_tQoK8mtLCr3jWikcewDCwXfjeh8q2SWp4LvrzDd0OD_P_v4btNUTUCMVWRphKAkEqlZJshqqv2VbejYtT240WndU_-bm6wXifZrOSbTSDaMtRUq5jgcG9Ul6gpf8wvqjOlsN1Re8QOYneMLHcG9-dKXmdnlqWtS0Zu_RwnpqmfmrBq5iNNmMeBzfr1FhU6r-LbnJiBzAmQJ7dCDCFZ9qG69NStKKnZ3PLsNk01OxO-j16AX-xXXbwD03mXljOvahWrXImegCr0lvU4qUBy2TY1OY2HfL4YljKie5Upsk0X6EHi41Y8SwcRX2Z4Yqz524sefgIOCsrJ/dl4/d5/L2dBISEvZ0FBIS9nQSEh/ "Constitution of The Commonwealth of The Bahamas"], ''[[Government of The Bahamas]]'', Nassau, 9 July 1973.

==History==
{{Main|History of The Bahamas}}

===Pre-colonial era===
The first inhabitants of The Bahamas were the [[Taíno people|Taino]] people, who moved into the uninhabited southern islands from [[Hispaniola]] and [[Cuba]] around the 800s–1000s AD, having migrated there from South America; they came to be known as the [[Lucayan people]].<ref name="Britannica, Bahamas">{{cite web |url=https://www.britannica.com/place/the-Bahamas |title=Encyclopedia Britannica – The Bahamas |access-date= 22 July 2019}}</ref> An estimated 30,000 Lucayans inhabited The Bahamas at the time of [[Christopher Columbus]]'s arrival in 1492.<ref>{{Cite book|title=The people who discovered Columbus : the prehistory of the Bahamas|last=Keegan, William F., 1955–|date=1992|publisher=University Press of Florida|others=Jay I.

===Arrival of the Spanish===

Columbus's first landfall in what was to Europeans a 'New World' was on an island he named San Salvador (known to the Lucayans as ''[[Guanahani]]''). Whilst there is a general consensus that this island lay within The Bahamas, precisely which island Columbus landed on is a matter of scholarly debate. Some researchers believe the site to be present-day [[San Salvador Island]] (formerly known as Watling's Island), situated in the southeastern Bahamas, whilst an alternative theory holds that Columbus landed to the southeast on [[Samana Cay]], according to calculations made in 1986 by ''[[National Geographic (magazine)|National Geographic]]'' writer and editor [[Joseph Judge]], based on Columbus's log. On the landfall island, Columbus made first contact with the Lucayans and exchanged goods with them, claiming the islands for the [[Crown of Castile]], before proceeding to explore the larger isles of the [[Greater Antilles]].<ref name="Britannica, Bahamas"/>

The 1494 [[Treaty of Tordesillas]] theoretically divided the new territories between the [[Kingdom of Castile]] and the [[Kingdom of Portugal]], placing The Bahamas in the Spanish sphere; however they did little to press their claim on the ground. The Spanish did however exploit the native Lucayan peoples, many of whom were enslaved and sent to Hispaniola for use as forced labour.<ref name="Britannica, Bahamas"/> The slaves suffered harsh conditions and most died from contracting [[Infectious disease|diseases]] to which they had no [[immunity (medical)|immunity]]; half of the Taino died from [[smallpox]] alone.<ref>[http://www.edweek.org/login.html?source=http://www.edweek.org/ew/articles/1991/10/09/06columb.h11.html&destination=http://www.edweek.org/ew/articles/1991/10/09/06columb.h11.html&levelId=2100 "Schools Grapple With Columbus's Legacy: Intrepid Explorer or Ruthless Conqueror?"], ''Education Week'', 9 October 1991</ref> As a result of these depredations the population of The Bahamas was severely diminished.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Dumene | first1 = Joanne E. | year = 1990 | title = Looking for Columbus | url = http://www.millersville.edu/~columbus/data/art/DUMENE01.ART | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20080919070618/http://www.millersville.edu/~columbus/data/art/DUMENE01.ART | url-status=dead | archive-date = 19 September 2008 | journal = Five Hundred Magazine | volume = 2 | issue = 1| pages = 11–15 }}</ref>

===Arrival of the English===
The English had expressed an interest in The Bahamas as early as 1629. However, it was not until 1648 that the first English settlers arrived on the islands. Known as the [[Eleutherian Adventurers]] and led by [[William Sayle]], they migrated to [[Bermuda]] seeking greater religious freedom. These English [[Puritans]] established the first permanent European settlement on an island which they named '[[Eleuthera]]', Greek for 'freedom'. They later settled [[New Providence]], naming it Sayle's Island. Life proved harder than envisaged however, and many – including Sayle – chose to return to Bermuda.<ref name="Britannica, Bahamas"/> To survive, the remaining settlers [[Wrecking (shipwreck)#The Bahamas|salvaged goods from wrecks]].

In 1670, [[Charles II of England|King Charles II]] granted the islands to the [[Lords Proprietors]] of the [[Province of Carolina|Carolinas]] in North America. They rented the islands from the king with rights of trading, tax, appointing [[Governor#British Empire and Commonwealth of Nations|governors]], and administering the country from their base on New Providence.<ref name="Anglican">{{cite web|year=2009 |url=http://bahamas.anglican.org/history.php |title=Diocesan History |publisher=Anglican Communications Department |access-date=7 May 2009 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090505100933/http://bahamas.anglican.org/history.php |archive-date=5 May 2009 }}</ref><ref name="Britannica, Bahamas"/> Piracy and attacks from hostile foreign powers were a constant threat.

During the [[American War of Independence]] in the late 18th century, the islands became a target for US naval forces. Under the command of Commodore [[Esek Hopkins]], [[United States Marine Corps|US Marines]], the US Navy occupied Nassau in 1776, before being evacuated a few days later. In 1782 a Spanish fleet appeared off the coast of Nassau, and the city [[Capture of The Bahamas (1782)|surrendered without a fight]]. Later, in April 1783, on a visit made by Prince William of the [[United Kingdom]] (later to become [[William IV of Great Britain|King William IV]]) to [[Luis de Unzaga]] at his residence in the Captaincy General of Havana, they made prisoner exchange agreements and also dealt with the preliminaries of the [[Treaty of Paris (1783)]], in which the recently conquered Bahamas would be exchanged for [[Spanish Florida|East Florida]], which would still have to conquer the city of [[St. Augustine, Florida]] in 1784 by order of Luis de Unzaga; after that, also in 1784, the Bahamas would be declared a British colony.<ref>Cazorla, Frank, Baena, Rose, Polo, David, Reder Gadow, Marion (2019) The Governor Louis de Unzaga (1717-1793) Pioneer in the birth of the United States and liberalism, Foundation Malaga, pages 21, 154-155, 163-165, 172, 188-191</ref>

===19th century===
The [[Slave Trade Act 1807]] abolished slave trading to British possessions, including the Bahamas.

These incidents, in which a total of 447 enslaved people belonging to US nationals were freed from 1830 to 1842, increased tension between the United States and the [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland|United Kingdom]]. They had been co-operating in patrols to suppress the international slave trade. However, worried about the stability of its large domestic slave trade and its value, the United States argued that the United Kingdom should not treat its domestic ships that came to its colonial ports under duress as part of the international trade. The United States worried that the success of the ''Creole'' slaves in gaining freedom would encourage more slave revolts on merchant ships.

Shortly after independence, The Bahamas joined the [[International Monetary Fund]] and the [[World Bank]] on 22 August 1973,<ref>{{cite news |title= Bahamas Joins IMF, World Bank |work= The Washington Post |date= 23 August 1973 |page= C2 |url= http://search.proquest.com/docview/148399257/}}</ref> and later the [[United Nations]] on 18 September 1973.<ref>{{cite news |title= 2 Germanys Join U.N. as Assembly Opens 28th Year |first= Robert |last= Alden |work= The New York Times |date= 19 September 1973 |page= 1 |url= http://search.proquest.com/docview/119811597/}}</ref>

Politically, the first two decades were dominated by Pindling's PLP, who went on to win a string of electoral victories. Allegations of corruption, links with drug cartels and financial malfeasance within the Bahamian government failed to dent Pindling's popularity. Meanwhile, the economy underwent a dramatic growth period fueled by the twin pillars of tourism and [[offshore finance]], significantly raising the standard of living on the islands. The Bahamas' booming economy led to it becoming a beacon for immigrants, most notably from [[Haiti]].<ref name="Britannica, Bahamas"/>

In September 2019, [[Hurricane Dorian]] struck the [[Abaco Islands]] and [[Grand Bahama]] at [[Saffir–Simpson scale#Category 5|Category 5]] intensity, devastating the northwestern Bahamas.

{{Main|Geography of the Bahamas}}
The Bahamas consists of a [[List of islands of The Bahamas|chain of islands]] spread out over some {{convert|500|mi|km|order=flip}} in the [[Atlantic Ocean]], located to the east of [[Florida]] in the United States, north of [[Cuba]] and [[Hispaniola]] and west of the British Overseas Territory of the [[Turks and Caicos Islands]] (with which it forms the [[Lucayan archipelago]]). It lies between latitudes [[20th parallel north|20°]] and [[28th parallel north|28°N]], and longitudes [[72nd meridian west|72°]] and [[80th meridian west|80°W]] and straddles the [[Tropic of Cancer]].<ref name="CIA World Factbook – The Bahamas"/> There are some 700 islands and 2,400 cays in total (of which 30 are inhabited) with a total land area of {{convert|10010|km2|abbr=on}}.<ref name="CIA World Factbook – The Bahamas"/><ref name="Britannica, Bahamas"/> 

[[Nassau, Bahamas|Nassau]], capital city of The Bahamas, lies on the island of [[New Providence]]; the other main inhabited islands are [[Grand Bahama]], [[Eleuthera]], [[Cat Island, Bahamas|Cat Island]], [[Rum Cay]], [[Long Island, Bahamas|Long Island]], [[San Salvador Island]], [[Ragged Island, Bahamas|Ragged Island]], [[Acklins]], [[Crooked Island (Bahamas)|Crooked Island]], [[Exuma]], [[Berry Islands]], [[Mayaguana]], the [[Bimini]] islands, [[Great Abaco]] and [[Great Inagua]]. The largest island is [[Andros, Bahamas|Andros]].<ref name="Britannica, Bahamas"/>

All the islands are low and flat, with ridges that usually rise no more than {{convert|15|to|20|m|ft|0|abbr=on}}. The highest point in the country is [[Mount Alvernia]] (formerly Como Hill) on Cat Island at {{convert|64|m|abbr=on}}.<ref name="CIA World Factbook – The Bahamas"/>

[[File:Koppen-Geiger_Map_BHS_present.svg|thumb|upright=1.45|The Bahamas map of Köppen climate classification.]] According to the [[Köppen climate classification]], the climate of The Bahamas is mostly [[tropical savannah climate]] or ''Aw'', with a hot and wet season and a warm and dry season. The low latitude, warm tropical [[Gulf Stream]], and low [[elevation]] give The Bahamas a warm and winterless climate.<ref>{{Cite journal|last1=Rabb|first1=George B.

As with most tropical climates, seasonal rainfall follows the sun, and summer is the wettest season. There is only a {{convert|7|C-change}} difference between the warmest month and coolest month in most of the Bahama islands. Every few decades low temperatures can fall below {{convert|10|°C}} for a few hours when a severe cold outbreak comes down from the North American mainland, however there has never been a frost or freeze recorded in the Bahamian Islands. Only once in recorded history has snow been seen in the air anywhere in The Bahamas, this occurred in Freeport on 19 January 1977, when snow mixed with rain was seen in the air for a short time.<ref>{{Cite web |title=40th Anniversary of Snow in South Florida |url=https://www.weather.gov/media/mfl/news/SnowArticleSouthFlorida40th.pdf |website=www.weather.gov |access-date=13 December 2018 }}</ref> The Bahamas are often sunny and dry for long periods of time, and average more than 3,000&nbsp;hours or 340&nbsp;days of sunlight annually. Much of the natural vegetation is tropical scrub and cactus and succulents are common in landscapes.<ref>{{cite web |title=Bahamas |website=Caribbean Islands |url=http://www.caribbeanislands.org/the-bahamas/ |access-date=4 December 2015 |date=4 December 2015 }}</ref>

Tropical storms and hurricanes occasionally impact The Bahamas. In 1992, [[Hurricane Andrew]] passed over the northern portions of the islands, and [[Hurricane Floyd]] passed near the eastern portions of the islands in 1999. [[Hurricane Dorian]] of 2019 passed over the archipelago at destructive [[Saffir–Simpson scale|Category&nbsp;5 strength]] with sustained winds of {{convert|185|mph|abbr=on|order=flip}} and wind gusts up to {{convert|220|mph|abbr=on|order=flip}}, becoming the strongest tropical cyclone on record to impact the northwestern islands of Grand Bahama and Great Abaco.<ref name=DorianBahamas>{{cite report |url=https://www.nhc.noaa.gov/archive/2019/al05/al052019.public.033.shtml? |title=Hurricane Dorian Advisory Number 33 |publisher=NHC}}</ref>

[[File:Blue Lagoon.JPG|thumb|The [[Blue Lagoon Island]], Bahamas.]]
The Bahamas is part of the [[Lucayan Archipelago]], which continues into the Turks and Caicos Islands, the [[Mouchoir Bank]], the [[Silver Bank]], and the [[Navidad Bank]].<ref name=Carew/>

The Bahamas Platform, which includes The Bahamas, Southern Florida, Northern Cuba, the Turks and Caicos, and the [[Blake Plateau]], formed about 150 [[megaannum|Ma]], not long after the formation of the [[North Atlantic]]. The {{convert|6.4|km||abbr=on|adj=on}} thick [[limestone]]s, which predominate in The Bahamas, date back to the [[Cretaceous]]. These limestones would have been deposited in shallow seas, assumed to be a stretched and thinned portion of the [[North American Plate|North American continental crust]]. Sediments were forming at about the same rate as the crust below was sinking due to the added weight. Thus, the entire area consisted of a large marine plain with some islands. Then, at about 80&nbsp;Ma, the area became flooded by the [[Gulf Stream]]. This resulted in the drowning of the Blake Plateau, the separation of The Bahamas from Cuba and Florida, the separation of the southeastern Bahamas into separate banks, the creation of the [[Cay Sal Bank]], plus the [[Bahama Banks|Little and Great Bahama Banks]]. Sedimentation from the "carbonate factory" of each bank, or [[atoll]], continues today at the rate of about {{convert|20|mm|abbr=on}} per [[kyr]]. [[Coral reef]]s form the "retaining walls" of these atolls, within which [[oolite]]s and [[pellets (petrology)|pellets]] form.<ref name="Sealey">{{cite book|last1=Sealey|first1=Neil|title=Bahamian Landscapes; An Introduction to the Geology and Physical Geography of The Bahamas|date=2006|publisher=Macmillan Education|location=Oxford|isbn=9781405064064|pages=1–24}}</ref>

Coral growth was greater through the [[Tertiary (geology)|Tertiary]], until the start of the [[ice ages]], and hence those deposits are more abundant below a depth of {{convert|36|m|abbr=on}}. In fact, an ancient extinct reef exists half a km seaward of the present one, {{convert|30|m|abbr=on}} below sea level. Oolites form when oceanic water penetrate the shallow banks, increasing the temperature about {{convert|3|C-change|abbr=on}} and the salinity by 0.5 per cent. [[Cementation (geology)|Cemented]] [[ooid]]s are referred to as grapestone. Additionally, giant [[stromatolite]]s are found off the [[Exuma Cays]].<ref name=Sealey/>{{rp|22,29–30}}

[[Sea level change]]s resulted in a drop in sea level, causing wind blown oolite to form [[sand dune]]s with distinct [[cross-bedding]]. Overlapping dunes form oolitic ridges, which become rapidly [[lithified]] through the action of rainwater, called [[eolianite]]. Most islands have ridges ranging from {{convert|30|to|45|m|abbr=on}}, though Cat Island has a ridge {{convert|60|m|abbr=on}} in height. The land between ridges is conducive to the formation of lakes and swamps.<ref name=Sealey/>{{rp|41–59,61–64}}

[[Solution weathering]] of the limestone results in a "Bahamian [[Karst]]" topography. This includes [[pothole (geology)|potholes]], [[blue hole]]s such as [[Dean's Blue Hole]], [[sinkhole]]s, [[beachrock]] such as the [[Bimini Road]] ("pavements of Atlantis"), [[caliche|limestone crust]], caves due to the lack of rivers, and [[sea caves]]. Several blue holes are aligned along the South Andros [[fault (geology)|Fault]] line. [[Tidal flat]]s and [[tidal creek]]s are common, but the more impressive drainage patterns are formed by troughs and canyons such as [[Great Bahama Canyon]] with the evidence of [[turbidity current]]s and [[turbidite]] deposition.<ref name=Sealey/>{{rp|33–40,65,72–84,86}}

The [[stratigraphy]] of the islands consists of the [[Middle Pleistocene]] Owl's Hole [[formation (geology)|Formation]], overlain by the [[Late Pleistocene]] Grotto Beach Formation, and then the [[Holocene]] Rice Bay Formation. However, these units are not necessarily stacked on top of each other but can be located laterally. The oldest formation, Owl's Hole, is capped by a [[terra rossa (soil)|terra rosa]] [[paleosoil]], as is the Grotto Beach, unless [[eroded]]. The Grotto Beach Formation is the most widespread.<ref name=Carew>{{cite book|last1=Carew|first1=James|last2=Mylroie|first2=John|editor1-last=Vacher|editor1-first=H.L.|editor2-last=Quinn|editor2-first=T.|title=Geology of Bahamas, in Geology and Hydrology of Carbonate Islands, Developments in Sedimentology 54|url=https://archive.org/details/geologyhydrogeol00vach_559|url-access=limited|date=1997|publisher=Elsevier Science B.V.|location=Amsterdam|isbn=9780444516442|pages=[https://archive.org/details/geologyhydrogeol00vach_559/page/n109 91]–139}}</ref>

===Administrative divisions===
{{Main|Local government in the Bahamas}}
The districts of The Bahamas provide a system of local government everywhere except [[New Providence]] (which holds 70 percent of the national population), whose affairs are handled directly by the central government. In 1996, the Bahamian Parliament passed the "Local Government Act" to facilitate the establishment of family island administrators, local government districts, local district councillors and local town committees for the various island communities. The overall goal of this act is to allow the various elected leaders to govern and oversee the affairs of their respective districts without the interference of the central government. In total, there are 32 districts, with elections being held every five years. There are 110 councillors and 281 town committee members elected to represent the various districts.<ref>[http://www.bahamas.gov.bs/bahamasweb2/home.nsf/vContentW/A5FB7665F3E4341306256F0000763055 Family Island District Councillors & Town Committee Members]. Bahamas.gov.bs. Retrieved on 20 April 2014.</ref>

Each councillor or town committee member is responsible for the proper use of public funds for the maintenance and development of their constituency.

[[File:Coat of arms of Bahamas.svg|thumb|upright|Bahamian Coat of Arms]]

The coat of arms of The Bahamas contains a shield with the national symbols as its focal point. The shield is supported by a [[marlin]] and a [[flamingo]], which are the national animals of The Bahamas. The flamingo is located on the land, and the marlin on the sea, indicating the geography of the islands.

On top of the shield is a conch shell, which represents the varied marine life of the island chain. The conch shell rests on a helmet. Below this is the actual shield, the main symbol of which is a ship representing the ''[[Santa Maria (ship)|Santa María]]'' of Christopher Columbus, shown sailing beneath the sun. Along the bottom, below the shield appears a banner upon which is the national motto:<ref>[https://archive.today/20120722015816/http://www.bahamasschools.com/National%20Coat%20of%20Arms.htm ASJ-Bahamas National Coat of Arms].

Selection of the yellow elder over many other flowers was made through the combined popular vote of members of all four of New Providence's garden clubs of the 1970s—the Nassau Garden Club, the Carver Garden Club, the International Garden Club and the [[YWCA]] Garden Club. They reasoned that other flowers grown there—such as the [[bougainvillea]], [[hibiscus]] and [[Delonix regia|poinciana]]—had already been chosen as the national flowers of other countries. The yellow elder, on the other hand, was unclaimed by other countries (although it is now also the national flower of the [[United States Virgin Islands]]) and also the yellow elder is native to the family islands.<ref>[https://archive.today/20120722015954/http://www.bahamasschools.com/Symbol%20-%20Flower.htm ASJ-Bahamas Symbol – Flower].

Since the colonial era of plantations, [[Africans]] or [[Afro-Bahamians]] have been the largest ethnic group in The Bahamas, whose primary ancestry was based in [[West Africa]].

The [[Haitians|Haitian]] community in The Bahamas is also largely of African descent and numbers about 80,000.

==Culture==
{{Main|Culture of the Bahamas|Music of the Bahamas}}

[[File:Junkanoo.jpg|thumb|[[Junkanoo]] celebration in [[Nassau, Bahamas|Nassau]]]]
The culture of the islands is a mixture of African (Afro-Bahamians being the largest ethnicity), British (as the former colonial power) and American (as the dominant country in the region and source of most tourists).<ref name="Britannica, Bahamas"/>

A form of African-based folk magic ([[obeah]]) is practised by some Bahamians, mainly in the Family Islands (out-islands) of The Bahamas.<ref>{{cite web|title=International Religious Freedom Report 2005 – Bahamas|url=https://2009-2017.state.gov/j/drl/rls/irf/2005/51625.htm|publisher=United States Department of State|access-date=22 July 2012}}</ref> The practice of obeah is illegal in The Bahamas and punishable in law.<ref>[http://laws.bahamas.gov.bs/cms/images/LEGISLATION/PRINCIPAL/1873/1873-0015/PenalCode_1.pdf "Practising Obeah, etc."], Ch. 84 Penal Code. laws.bahamas.gov.bs</ref>

In the less developed outer islands (or Family Islands), handicrafts include basketry made from palm fronds. This material, commonly called "straw", is plaited into hats and bags that are popular tourist items. Another use is for so-called "Voodoo dolls", even though such dolls are the result of foreign influences and not based in historic fact.<ref>[[Hurbon, Laennec]] (1995). "American Fantasy and Haitian Vodou." ''Sacred Arts of Haitian Vodou''. Ed. Donald J. Cosentino. Los Angeles: [[UCLA Fowler Museum of Cultural History]], pp. 181–97.</ref>

[[Junkanoo]] is a traditional Afro-Bahamian street parade of 'rushing', music, dance and art held in Nassau (and a few other settlements) every [[Boxing Day]] and [[New Year's Day]]. Junkanoo is also used to celebrate other holidays and events such as Emancipation Day.<ref name="Britannica, Bahamas"/>

[[Regatta]]s are important social events in many family island settlements. They usually feature one or more days of sailing by old-fashioned [[Boat|work boats]], as well as an onshore festival.<ref>{{cite web |title=Native Boat Regattas in The Bahamas |url=https://www.worldnomads.com/explore/caribbean/the-bahamas/native-boat-regattas-in-the-bahamas |website=World Nomads |access-date=4 February 2021}}</ref>

Many dishes are associated with [[Bahamian cuisine]], which reflects Caribbean, African and European influences. Some settlements have festivals associated with the traditional crop or food of that area, such as the "Pineapple Fest" in Gregory Town, [[Eleuthera]] or the "Crab Fest" on Andros. Other significant traditions include [[story telling]].

Bahamians have created a rich literature of poetry, short stories, plays and short fictional works. Common themes in these works are (1) an awareness of change, (2) a striving for sophistication, (3) a search for identity, (4) nostalgia for the old ways and (5) an appreciation of beauty. Some major writers are Susan Wallace, Percival Miller, Robert Johnson, Raymond Brown, O.M. Smith, William Johnson, Eddie Minnis and [[Winston Saunders]].<ref>Collinwood, Dean W. and Dodge, Steve (1989) ''Modern Bahamian Society'', Caribbean Books, {{ISBN|0931209013}}.</ref><ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Collinwood | first1 = Dean | last2 = Phillips | first2 = Rick | year = 1990 | title = The National Literature of the New Bahamas | journal = Weber Studies | volume = 7 | issue = 1| pages = 43–62 }}</ref>

Bahamas culture is rich with beliefs, traditions, folklore and legend. The best-known folklore and legends in The Bahamas include the [[lusca]] and [[chickcharney]] creatures of Andros, Pretty Molly on Exuma Bahamas and the Lost City of [[Atlantis]] on Bimini Bahamas.

The [[geography of Ireland]] comprises relatively low-lying mountains surrounding a central plain, with [[Rivers of Ireland|several navigable rivers]] extending inland. Its lush vegetation is a product of its mild but changeable climate which is free of extremes in temperature. Much of Ireland was woodland until the end of the [[Middle Ages]].

The island was Christianised from the 5th century onward. Following the 12th century [[Norman invasion of Ireland|Anglo-Norman invasion]], [[Kingdom of England|England]] claimed sovereignty. However, English rule did not extend over the whole island until the 16th–17th century [[Tudor conquest of Ireland|Tudor conquest]], which led to [[Plantation of Ireland|colonisation by settlers from Britain]]. In the 1690s, a system of [[Protestant Ascendancy|Protestant English rule]] was designed to materially disadvantage the [[Catholic Church|Catholic]] majority and Protestant [[dissenters]], and was extended during the 18th century. With the [[Acts of Union 1800|Acts of Union]] in 1801, Ireland became [[Countries of the United Kingdom|a part of]] the [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland|United Kingdom]]. A [[Irish War of Independence|war of independence]] in the early 20th century was followed by the [[Partition of Ireland|partition of the island]], creating the [[Irish Free State]], which became increasingly sovereign over the following decades, and Northern Ireland, which remained a part of the United Kingdom. Northern Ireland saw much [[The Troubles|civil unrest from the late 1960s until the 1990s]]. This subsided following [[Good Friday Agreement|a political agreement]] in 1998. In 1973 the Republic of Ireland joined the [[European Economic Community]] while the United Kingdom, and Northern Ireland, as part of it, did the same.

[[Irish culture]] has had a significant influence on other cultures, especially in the field of [[Irish literature|literature]]. Alongside mainstream [[Western culture]], a strong indigenous culture exists, as expressed through [[Gaelic games]], [[Irish music]] and the [[Irish language]]. The island's culture shares many features with that of Great Britain, including the [[English language]], and sports such as [[association football]], [[Rugby football|rugby]], [[horse racing]], and [[golf]].

==Etymology==
The names ''Ireland'' and {{lang|ga|Éire}} derive from [[Old Irish]] ''[[Ériu]]'', a goddess in [[Irish mythology]] first recorded in the ninth century. The etymology of Ériu is disputed but may derive from the [[Proto-Indo-European]] root *''{{PIE|h2uer}}'', referring to flowing water.<ref>{{cite encyclopedia |last1=Ní Mhurchú |first1=Síle |editor1-last=Echard |editor1-first=Sian |editor2-last=Rouse |editor2-first=Robert |title=Ériu|encyclopedia=The Encyclopedia of Medieval Literature in Britain, 4 Volume Set |date=2017 |publisher=John Wiley & Sons |isbn=978-1-118-39698-8 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=UXoqDwAAQBAJ&q=Eriu+etymology&pg=PA750|location=Chichester |language=en|page=750}}</ref>

During the [[last glacial period]], and until about 10,000 BC, most of Ireland was periodically covered in ice. [[Sea levels]] were lower and Ireland, like Great Britain, formed part of continental Europe. By 16,000 BC, rising sea levels caused by ice melting caused Ireland to become separated from Great Britain.<ref name=drowning>Edwards, Robin & al.

====Emergence of Celtic Ireland====
How and when the island became Celtic has been debated for close to a century, with the migrations of the Celts being one of the more enduring themes of archaeological and linguistic studies. The most recent genetic research strongly associates the spread of Indo-European languages (including Celtic) through Western Europe with a people bringing a composite [[Beaker culture]], with its arrival in Britain and Ireland dated to around the middle of the third millennium&nbsp;BC.<ref name="Reich 2018 115">{{cite book |last=Reich |first=David |title=Who We Are and How We Got Here: Ancient DNA and the New Science of the Human Past |year=2018 |publisher=[[Oxford University Press]] |location=Oxford |isbn=978-0-19-882125-0 |page=115}}</ref> According to [[John T.

The long-standing traditional view is that the Celtic language, [[Ogham]] script and culture were brought to Ireland by waves of invading or migrating [[Celts]] from mainland Europe. This theory draws on the ''[[Lebor Gabála Érenn]]'', a medieval Christian pseudo-history of Ireland, along with the presence of Celtic culture, language and artifacts found in Ireland such as Celtic bronze spears, shields, torcs and other finely crafted Celtic associated possessions. The theory holds that there were four separate Celtic invasions of Ireland. The [[Priteni]] were said to be the first, followed by the [[Belgae]] from northern Gaul and Britain. Later, Laighin tribes from Armorica (present-day Brittany) were said to have invaded Ireland and Britain more or less simultaneously. Lastly, the [[Milesians (Irish)|Milesians]] ([[Gaels]]) were said to have reached Ireland from either northern Iberia or southern Gaul.<ref>''The Celts: A History'', by Dáithí Ó hÓgáin</ref> It was claimed that a second wave named the Euerni, belonging to the Belgae people of northern Gaul, began arriving about the sixth century BC. They were said to have given their name to the island.<ref>Early Peoples of Britain and Ireland: A-G Christopher Allen Snyder</ref><ref>"A History of Ireland: From the Earliest Times to 1922" By Edmund Curtis</ref>

The theory was advanced in part because of lack of archaeological evidence for large-scale Celtic [[immigration]], though it is accepted that such movements are notoriously difficult to identify. Historical linguists are skeptical that this method alone could account for the absorption of Celtic language, with some saying that an assumed processional view of Celtic linguistic formation is 'an especially hazardous exercise'.<ref>{{cite book |last=Waddell |first=John |title=Ireland in the Bronze Age |publisher=Irish Government Stationery Office |date=April 1995 |location=Dublin |url=http://www.nuigalway.ie/archaeology/oldsite/documents/jw_celts.pdf |archive-date=19 March 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150319230912/http://www.nuigalway.ie/archaeology/oldsite/documents/jw_celts.pdf}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |last=Waddell |first=John |title=The Question of the Celticization of Ireland |publisher=Emania |date=September 1992 |url=http://www.nuigalway.ie/archaeology/oldsite/documents/jw_celticization_of_ire.pdf |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150721151900/http://www.nuigalway.ie/archaeology/oldsite/documents/jw_celticization_of_ire.pdf |archive-date=21 July 2015}}</ref> Genetic lineage investigation into the area of Celtic migration to Ireland has led to findings that showed no significant differences in [[mitochondrial DNA]] between Ireland and large areas of continental Europe, in contrast to parts of the Y-chromosome pattern. When taking both into account, a study concluded that modern Celtic speakers in Ireland could be thought of as European "Atlantic Celts" showing a shared ancestry throughout the Atlantic zone from northern Iberia to western Scandinavia rather than substantially central European.<ref>{{cite journal |pmc=1182057 |title=The Longue Durée of Genetic Ancestry: Multiple Genetic Marker Systems and Celtic Origins on the Atlantic Facade of Europe |pmid=15309688 |doi=10.1086/424697 |volume=75 |issue=4 |date=October 2004 |journal=[[American Journal of Human Genetics]] |pages=693–702 |last1=McEvoy |first1=B. |last2=Richards |first2=M. |last3=Forster |first3=P. |last4=Bradley |first4=D.G.}}</ref>

In 2012, research showed that occurrence of genetic markers for the earliest farmers was almost eliminated by Beaker-culture immigrants: they carried what was then a new Y-chromosome R1b marker, believed to have originated in Iberia about 2500 BC. The prevalence amongst modern Irish men of this mutation is a remarkable 84%, the highest in the world, and closely matched in other populations along the Atlantic fringes down to Spain. A similar genetic replacement happened with lineages in mitochondrial DNA.<ref name="Ireland's DNA"/><ref>{{cite web |last1=Hay |first1=Maciamo |title=Haplogroup R1b (Y-DNA) |url=http://www.eupedia.com/europe/Haplogroup_R1b_Y-DNA.shtml |website=Eupedia |access-date=1 August 2015}}</ref> This conclusion is supported by recent research carried out by the geneticist [[David Reich (geneticist)|David Reich]], who says: “British and Irish skeletons from the Bronze Age that followed the Beaker period had at most 10 percent ancestry from the first farmers of these islands, with other 90 percent from people like those associated with the Bell Beaker culture in the Netherlands.” He suggests that it was Beaker users who introduced an Indo-European language, represented here by Celtic (i.e. a new language and culture introduced directly by migration and genetic replacement).<ref name="Reich 2018 115"/>

The earliest written records of Ireland come from classical [[Greco-Roman world|Greco-Roman]] geographers. [[Ptolemy]] in his ''[[Almagest]]'' refers to Ireland as ''Mikra Brettania'' ("Little Britain"), in contrast to the larger island, which he called ''Megale Brettania'' ("Great Britain").<ref>{{cite book |last=Freeman |first=Philip |title=Ireland and the classical world |publisher=[[University of Texas Press]] |date=2001 |location=Austin, Texas |page=65 |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=ZSHhfOM-5AEC&pg=PA65 |isbn=978-0-292-72518-8}}</ref> In his later work, ''[[Geography (Ptolemy)|Geography]]'', Ptolemy refers to Ireland as ''[[Hibernia|Iouernia]]'' and to Great Britain as ''Albion''. These 'new' names were likely to have been the local names for the islands at the time.

Ireland continued as a patchwork of rival kingdoms; however, beginning in the 7th century, a concept of national kingship gradually became articulated through the concept of a [[High King of Ireland]]. [[Medieval Irish literature]] portrays an almost unbroken sequence of high kings stretching back thousands of years, but modern historians believe the scheme was constructed in the 8th century to justify the status of powerful political groupings by projecting the origins of their rule into the remote past.<ref name="DOC">{{lang|ga|[[Dáibhí Ó Cróinín]]}}, "Ireland, 400–800", in {{lang|ga|Dáibhí Ó Cróinín}} (ed.), ''A New History of Ireland 1: Prehistoric and Early Ireland'', Oxford University Press, 2005, pp. 182–234.</ref>

All of the Irish kingdoms had their own kings but were nominally subject to the high king. The high king was drawn from the ranks of the provincial kings and ruled also the royal [[kingdom of Meath]], with a ceremonial capital at the [[Hill of Tara]].

In 1166, Mac Murrough had fled to [[Anjou]], France, following a war involving [[Tighearnán Ua Ruairc]], of [[Breifne]], and sought the assistance of the [[Angevin Empire|Angevin]] King [[King Henry II of England|Henry II]], in recapturing his kingdom. In 1171, Henry arrived in Ireland in order to review the general progress of the expedition. He wanted to re-exert royal authority over the invasion which was expanding beyond his control. Henry successfully re-imposed his authority over Strongbow and the Cambro-Norman warlords and persuaded many of the Irish kings to accept him as their overlord, an arrangement confirmed in the 1175 [[Treaty of Windsor 1175|Treaty of Windsor]].

The invasion was legitimised by the provisions of the [[Papal Bull]] ''[[Laudabiliter]]'', issued by an Englishman, [[Pope Adrian IV|Adrian IV]], in 1155.

In 1172, Pope [[Pope Alexander III|Alexander III]] further encouraged Henry to advance the integration of the Irish Church with Rome. Henry was authorised to impose a tithe of one penny per hearth as an annual contribution. This church levy, called [[Peter's Pence]], is extant in Ireland as a voluntary donation. In turn, Henry accepted the title of [[Lord of Ireland]] which Henry conferred on his younger son, [[John Lackland]], in 1185. This defined the Irish state as the [[Lordship of Ireland]].{{citation needed|date=February 2016}} When Henry's successor died unexpectedly in 1199, [[John of England|John]] inherited the crown of England and retained the Lordship of Ireland.

Over the century that followed, Norman feudal law gradually replaced the Gaelic Brehon Law so that by the late 13th century the [[Hiberno-Norman|Norman-Irish]] had established a feudal system throughout much of Ireland. Norman settlements were characterised by the establishment of baronies, manors, towns and the seeds of the modern county system. A version of the [[Magna Carta]] (the [[Great Charter of Ireland]]), substituting ''Dublin'' for ''London'' and the ''Irish Church'' for, the English church at the time, the ''Catholic Church'', was published in 1216 and the [[Parliament of Ireland]] was founded in 1297.

From the mid-14th century, after the [[Black Death]], Norman settlements in Ireland went into a period of decline. The Norman rulers and the Gaelic Irish elites intermarried and the areas under Norman rule became [[Gaelicisation|Gaelicised]]. In some parts, a hybrid Hiberno-Norman culture emerged. In response, the [[Parliament of Ireland#Middle Ages|Irish parliament]] passed the [[Statutes of Kilkenny]] in 1367. These were a set of laws designed to prevent the assimilation of the Normans into Irish society by requiring English subjects in Ireland to speak English, follow English customs and abide by English law.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.jrbooksonline.com/PDF_Books/irish.pdf |title=The Great Irish Famine: Laws that Isolated and Impoverished the Irish |publisher=New Jersey Commission on Holocaust Education |date=1998 |website=Irish Famine Curriculum Committee |access-date=9 September 2011}}</ref>

By the end of the 15th century, central English authority in Ireland had all but disappeared, and a renewed Irish culture and language, albeit with Norman influences, was dominant again. English Crown control remained relatively unshaken in an amorphous foothold around Dublin known as [[The Pale]], and under the provisions of [[Poynings' Law (on certification of acts)|Poynings' Law]] of 1494, the Irish Parliamentary legislation was subject to the approval of the [[English Privy Council]].<ref>{{cite journal |last=Pack |first=Mark |title=Charles James Fox, the Repeal of Poynings Law, and the Act of Union: 1782–1801 |journal=Journal of Liberal History |volume=33 |date=2001 |page=6 |url= http://www.markpack.org.uk/1288/charles-james-fox-the-repeal-of-poynings-law-and-the-act-of-union/ |access-date=23 March 2015}}</ref>

The title of [[King of Ireland]] was re-created in 1542 by [[Henry VIII]], the then [[King of England]], of the [[Tudor dynasty]]. English rule was reinforced and expanded in Ireland during the latter part of the 16th century, leading to the [[Tudor conquest of Ireland]]. A near-complete conquest was achieved by the turn of the 17th century, following the [[Nine Years' War (Ireland)|Nine Years' War]] and the [[Flight of the Earls]].

This control was consolidated during the wars and conflicts of the 17th century, including the English and Scottish colonisation in the [[Plantations of Ireland]], the [[Wars of the Three Kingdoms]] and the [[Williamite War in Ireland|Williamite War]].

The religious struggles of the 17th century left a deep sectarian division in Ireland. Religious allegiance now determined the perception in law of loyalty to the Irish King and Parliament. After the passing of [[Test Act#1672 Act|the Test Act 1672]], and the victory of the forces of the dual monarchy of [[William III of England|William]] and [[Mary II of England|Mary]] over the [[Jacobitism|Jacobites]], Roman Catholics and nonconforming Protestant Dissenters were barred from sitting as members in the [[Parliament of Ireland|Irish Parliament]]. Under the emerging [[Penal Laws (Ireland)|Penal Laws]], Irish Roman Catholics and Dissenters were increasingly deprived of various and sundry civil rights even to the ownership of hereditary property. Additional regressive punitive legislation followed in 1703, 1709 and 1728. This completed a comprehensive systemic effort to materially disadvantage Roman Catholics and Protestant Dissenters, while enriching a new ruling class of Anglican conformists.<ref>{{cite web |title=Laws in Ireland for the Suppression of Popery |publisher=University of Minnesota Law School |url= http://library.law.umn.edu/irishlaw/offices.html |access-date=23 January 2009}}</ref> The new Anglo-Irish ruling class became known as the [[Protestant Ascendancy]].

The "[[Irish Famine (1740–1741)#Cause|Great Frost]]" struck Ireland and the rest of Europe between December 1739 and September 1741, after a decade of relatively mild winters. The winters destroyed stored crops of potatoes and other staples, and the poor summers severely damaged harvests.<ref>{{cite book |first=David |last=Dickson |title=Arctic Ireland: The Extraordinary Story of the Great Frost and Forgotten Famine of 1740–41 |publisher=White Row Press |location=Belfast |date=1997 |isbn=978-1-870132-85-5}}</ref>{{page needed|date=October 2019}} This resulted in the [[Irish Famine (1740–1741)|famine of 1740]].

In the aftermath of the famine, an increase in industrial production and a surge in trade brought a succession of construction booms. The population soared in the latter part of this century and the [[Georgian architecture|architectural legacy of Georgian]] Ireland was built. In 1782, [[Poynings' Law (on certification of acts)|Poynings' Law]] was repealed, giving Ireland legislative independence from Great Britain for the first time since 1495. The British government, however, still retained the right to nominate the government of Ireland without the consent of the Irish parliament.

In 1798, members of the Protestant Dissenter tradition (mainly [[Presbyterianism|Presbyterian]]) made common cause with Roman Catholics in a republican rebellion inspired and led by the [[Society of United Irishmen]], with the aim of creating an independent Ireland. Despite assistance from France the [[Irish Rebellion of 1798|rebellion]] was put down by British and Irish government and yeomanry forces. In 1800, the British and Irish parliaments both passed [[Acts of Union 1800|Acts of Union]] that, with effect from 1 January 1801, merged the [[Kingdom of Ireland]] and the [[Kingdom of Great Britain]] to create a [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland]].<ref name="Ward 1994 28">{{cite book |last=Ward |first=Alan J. |title=The Irish Constitutional Tradition: Responsible Government and Modern Ireland, 1782–1992 |publisher=Catholic University of America Press |date=1994 |location=Washington, DC |page=28 |isbn=978-0-8132-0784-1}}</ref>

The passage of the Act in the Irish Parliament was ultimately achieved with substantial majorities, having failed on the first attempt in 1799. According to contemporary documents and historical analysis, this was achieved through a considerable degree of bribery, with funding provided by the British Secret Service Office, and the awarding of peerages, places and honours to secure votes.<ref name="Ward 1994 28"/> Thus, the parliament in Ireland was abolished and replaced by a [[Parliament of the United Kingdom|united parliament at Westminster]] in [[London]], though resistance remained, as evidenced by [[Robert Emmet]]'s failed [[Irish Rebellion of 1803]].

Aside from the development of the [[linen]] industry, Ireland was largely passed over by the [[industrial revolution]], partly because it lacked coal and iron resources<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.worldtimelines.org.uk/world/british_isles/ireland/AD1750-1900 |title=Ireland AD 1750–1900 The Industrial Age |website=WorldTimelines.org.uk |publisher=The British Museum |access-date=28 March 2010 |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20101226180112/http://worldtimelines.org.uk/world/british_isles/ireland/AD1750-1900 |archive-date=26 December 2010}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=LamjgLbhTvwC&q=ireland+failed+to+industrialize+due+to+lack+of+coal+and+iron&pg=PA314 |first=Cormac |last=O'Grada |title=Ireland: A New Economic History, 1780–1939 |publisher=Oxford University Press |date=1994 |pages=314–330 |isbn=978-0-19-820598-2}}</ref> and partly because of the impact of the sudden union with the structurally superior economy of England,<ref>{{cite book |title=Culture and Capitalism in Contemporary Ireland |first1=Paul |last1=Keating |first2=Derry |last2=Desmond |publisher=Avebury Press |location=Hampshire, UK |date=1993 |isbn=978-1-85628-362-5 |page=119}}</ref> which saw Ireland as a source of agricultural produce and capital.<ref>{{cite journal |first=John |last=Jacobsen |title=Chasing Progress in the Irish Republic |publisher=Cambridge University Press |date=1994 |page=47}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |first=Joel |last=Mokyr |title=Why Ireland Starved: A Quantitative and Analytical History of the Irish Economy, 1800–1850 |publisher=Taylor and Francis |location=Oxon |date=1983 |page=152}}</ref>

The [[Great Famine (Ireland)|Great Famine]] of 1845–1851 devastated Ireland, as in those years Ireland's population fell by one-third. More than one million people died from starvation and disease, with an additional million people emigrating during the famine, mostly to the [[United States]] and [[Canada]].<ref>{{cite web |title=The Irish Potato Famine |website=Digital History |publisher=University of Houston |date=7 November 2008 |url= http://www.digitalhistory.uh.edu/voices/irish_potato_famine.cfm |access-date=8 November 2008}}</ref> In the century that followed, an economic depression caused by the famine resulted in a further million people emigrating.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.wesleyjohnston.com/users/ireland/past/famine/emigration.html|title=Effects of the Famine: Emigration|website=www.wesleyjohnston.com|access-date=18 December 2019}}</ref> By the end of the decade, half of all [[immigration to the United States]] was from Ireland. The period of civil unrest that followed until the end of the 19th century is referred to as the [[Land War]]. Mass emigration became deeply entrenched and the population continued to decline until the mid-20th century. Immediately prior to the famine the population was recorded as 8.2 million by the [[United Kingdom census, 1841|1841 census]].<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/this-britain/1841-a-window-on-victorian-britain-475516.html |title=1841: A window on Victorian Britain – This Britain |work=[[The Independent]] |date=25 April 2006 |access-date=16 April 2009 |last=Vallely |first=Paul |location=London |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20150617075008/http://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/this-britain/1841-a-window-on-victorian-britain-475516.html |archive-date=17 June 2015}}</ref> The population has never returned to this level since.<ref>{{cite news |last=Quinn |first=Eamon |title=Ireland Learns to Adapt to a Population Growth Spurt |work=[[The New York Times]] |date=19 August 2007 |url= https://www.nytimes.com/2007/08/19/world/europe/19ireland.html?ex=1345176000&en=ab2b49203b6fb511&ei=5088&partner=rssnyt&emc=rss |access-date=8 November 2008}}</ref> The population continued to fall until 1961; [[County Leitrim]] was the final Irish county to record a population increase post-famine, in 2006.

The 19th and early 20th centuries saw the rise of modern [[Irish nationalism]], primarily among the Roman Catholic population. The pre-eminent Irish political figure after the Union was [[Daniel O'Connell]]. He was elected as Member of Parliament for [[Ennis (UK Parliament constituency)|Ennis]] in a surprise result and despite being unable to take his seat [[The Test Act|as a Roman Catholic]]. O'Connell spearheaded a vigorous campaign that was taken up by the Prime Minister, the Irish-born soldier and statesman, the [[Arthur Wellesley, 1st Duke of Wellington|Duke of Wellington]]. Steering the [[Roman Catholic Relief Act 1829|Catholic Relief Bill]] through Parliament, aided by future prime minister [[Robert Peel]], Wellington prevailed upon a reluctant [[George IV of the United Kingdom|George IV]] to sign the Bill and proclaim it into law. [[George III of the United Kingdom|George's father]] had opposed the plan of the earlier Prime Minister, [[William Pitt the Younger|Pitt the Younger]], to introduce such a bill following the Union of 1801, fearing [[Catholic Emancipation]] to be in conflict with the [[Act of Settlement 1701]].

Daniel O'Connell led a subsequent campaign, for the repeal of the Act of Union, which failed. Later in the century, [[Charles Stewart Parnell]] and others campaigned for autonomy within the Union, or "[[Irish Home Rule Bills|Home Rule]]". Unionists, especially those located in Ulster, were strongly opposed to Home Rule, which they thought would be dominated by Catholic interests.<ref>{{cite book |last=Kee |first=Robert |title=The Green Flag: A History of Irish Nationalism |publisher=Weidenfeld & Nicolson |date=1972 |location=London |pages=376–400 |isbn=978-0-297-17987-0}}</ref> After several attempts to pass a Home Rule bill through parliament, it looked certain that one would finally pass in 1914. To prevent this from happening, the [[Ulster Volunteers]] were formed in 1913 under the leadership of [[Edward Carson]].<ref name="Kee 1972 478–530">{{cite book |last=Kee |first=Robert |title=The Green Flag: A History of Irish Nationalism |publisher=Weidenfeld & Nicolson |date=1972 |location=London |pages=478–530 |isbn=978-0-297-17987-0}}</ref>

Their formation was followed in 1914 by the establishment of the [[Irish Volunteers]], whose aim was to ensure that the [[Third Home Rule Act|Home Rule Bill]] was passed. The Act was passed but with the "temporary" exclusion of the six counties of Ulster that would become Northern Ireland. Before it could be implemented, however, the Act was suspended for the duration of the [[World War I|First World War]]. The Irish Volunteers split into two groups. The majority, approximately 175,000 in number, under [[John Redmond]], took the name [[National Volunteers]] and supported [[Ireland and World War I|Irish involvement]] in the war. A minority, approximately 13,000, retained the Irish Volunteers' name and opposed Ireland's involvement in the war.<ref name="Kee 1972 478–530"/>

[[File:Sackville Street (Dublin) after the 1916 Easter Rising.JPG|thumb|Sackville Street (now [[O'Connell Street]]), Dublin, after the 1916 [[Easter Rising]]]]
The [[Easter Rising]] of 1916 was carried out by the latter group together with a smaller socialist militia, the [[Irish Citizen Army]]. The British response, executing fifteen leaders of the Rising over a period of ten days and imprisoning or interning more than a thousand people, turned the mood of the country in favour of the rebels. Support for [[Physical force Irish republicanism|Irish republicanism increased]] further due to the ongoing war in Europe, as well as the [[Conscription Crisis of 1918]].<ref name="autogenerated34">{{cite journal |last=Morough |first=Michael |title=History Review |date=December 2000 |pages=34–36}}</ref>

The pro-independence republican party, [[Sinn Féin]], received overwhelming endorsement in the [[1918 Irish general election|general election of 1918]], and in 1919 proclaimed an [[Irish Republic]], setting up its own parliament ({{lang|ga|[[First Dáil|Dáil Éireann]]}}) and government. Simultaneously the Volunteers, which became known as the [[Irish Republican Army]] (IRA), launched a [[Irish War of Independence|three-year guerrilla war]], which ended in a truce in July 1921 (although violence continued until June 1922, mostly in Northern Ireland).<ref name="autogenerated34" />

===Partition===
{{Main|Partition of Ireland}}

In December 1921, the [[Anglo-Irish Treaty]] was concluded between the British government and representatives of the [[Second Dáil]]. It gave Ireland complete independence in its home affairs and practical independence for foreign policy, but an opt-out clause allowed [[Northern Ireland]] to remain within the United Kingdom, which (as expected) it immediately exercised. Additionally, Members of the [[Third Dáil|Free State Parliament]] were required to swear [[Oath of Allegiance (Ireland)|an oath of allegiance to the Constitution of the Irish Free State]] and make a statement of faithfulness to the King.<ref>{{cite book |last=Kee |first=Robert |title=The Green Flag: A History of Irish Nationalism |publisher=Weidenfeld & Nicolson |date=1972 |location=London |pages=719–748 |isbn=978-0-297-17987-0}}</ref> Disagreements over these provisions led to a split in the nationalist movement and a subsequent [[Irish Civil War]] between the new government of the [[Irish Free State]] and those opposed to the treaty, led by [[Éamon de Valera]]. The civil war officially ended in May 1923 when de Valera issued a cease-fire order.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Gwynn |first=Stephen |title=Ireland Since the Treaty |journal=Foreign Affairs |volume=12 |issue=2 |date=January 1934 |page=322 |doi=10.2307/20030588|jstor=20030588}}</ref>

During its first decade, the newly formed [[Irish Free State]] was governed by the victors of the civil war. When de Valera achieved power, he took advantage of the [[Statute of Westminster 1931|Statute of Westminster]] and [[Edward VIII abdication crisis|political circumstances]] to build upon inroads to greater sovereignty made by the previous government. The oath was abolished and in 1937 a new constitution was adopted.<ref name="autogenerated34"/> This completed a process of gradual separation from the British Empire that governments had pursued since independence. However, it was not until 1949 that the state was declared, officially, to be the [[Republic of Ireland]].

To the authorities, counterintelligence was a fundamental line of defence.

Large-scale emigration marked most of the post-WWII period (particularly during the 1950s and 1980s), but beginning in 1987 the economy improved, and the 1990s saw the beginning of substantial economic growth.

F. Foster (historian)|R. F. Foster]]  argues the cause was a combination of a new sense of initiative and the entry of American corporations. He concludes the chief factors were low taxation, pro-business regulatory policies, and a young, tech-savvy workforce. For many multinationals, the decision to do business in Ireland was made easier still by generous incentives from the [[IDA Ireland|Industrial Development Authority]]. In addition [[European Union]] membership was helpful, giving the country lucrative access to markets that it had previously reached only through the United Kingdom, and pumping huge subsidies and investment capital into the Irish economy.<ref>R. F. Foster, ''Luck and the Irish: A Brief History of Change 1970-2000'' (2007), pp 7-36.</ref>

Modernisation brought secularisation in its wake. The traditionally high levels of religiosity have sharply declined. Foster points to three factors: Irish feminism, largely imported from America with liberal stances on contraception, abortion, and divorce undermined the authority of bishops and priests. Second, the mishandling of the pedophile scandals humiliated the Church, whose bishops seemed less concerned with the victims and more concerned with covering up for errant priests. Third, prosperity brought hedonism and materialism that undercut the ideals of saintly poverty.<ref>Foster, ''Luck and the Irish'' pp 37-66.</ref>

The [[Post-2008 Irish economic downturn|financial crisis]] that began in 2008 dramatically ended this period of boom. GDP fell by 3% in 2008 and by 7.1% in 2009, the worst year since records began (although earnings by foreign-owned businesses continued to grow).<ref>{{cite news |first=Shawn |last=Pogatchnik |title=Ireland's Economy Suffered Record Slump in 2009 |work=[[Business Week]] |date=25 March 2010 |access-date=6 April 2010 |url= http://www.businessweek.com/ap/financialnews/D9ELOCOG1.htm |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20150208020158/http://www.businessweek.com/ap/financialnews/D9ELOCOG1.htm |archive-date=8 February 2015}}</ref> The state has since experienced deep recession, with unemployment, which doubled during 2009, remaining above 14% in 2012.<ref>{{cite web |title=Measuring Ireland's Progress 2011 |website=CSO.ie |publisher=[[Central Statistics Office (Ireland)|Central Statistics Office]] |date=October 2012 |page=36 |url= http://www.cso.ie/en/media/csoie/releasespublications/documents/otherreleases/2011/measuringirelandsprogress2011.pdf |issn=1649-6728 |access-date=30 August 2015}}</ref>

====Northern Ireland====
{{Main|History of Northern Ireland|Economy of Northern Ireland}}
Northern Ireland resulted from the division of the United Kingdom by the [[Government of Ireland Act 1920]], and until 1972 was a self-governing jurisdiction within the United Kingdom with its own parliament and prime minister. Northern Ireland, as part of the United Kingdom, was not neutral during the Second World War, and [[Belfast Blitz|Belfast suffered four bombing raids]] in 1941. [[Conscription]] was not extended to Northern Ireland, and roughly an equal number volunteered from Northern Ireland as volunteered from the south.

Although Northern Ireland was largely spared the strife of the civil war, in decades that followed partition there were sporadic episodes of inter-communal violence. Nationalists, mainly Roman Catholic, wanted to unite Ireland as an independent republic, whereas unionists, mainly Protestant, wanted Northern Ireland to remain in the United Kingdom. The Protestant and Catholic communities in Northern Ireland voted largely along [[sectarian]] lines, meaning that the government of Northern Ireland (elected by [[Plurality electoral system|"first-past-the-post"]] from 1929) was controlled by the [[Ulster Unionist Party]]. Over time, the minority Catholic community felt increasingly alienated with further disaffection fuelled by practices such as [[gerrymandering]] and discrimination in housing and employment.<ref name=whyte>{{cite book |chapter-url=http://cain.ulst.ac.uk/issues/discrimination/whyte.htm |chapter=How much discrimination was there under the Unionist regime, 1921–1968? |last=Whyte |first=John |editor-first1=Tom |editor-last1=Gallagher |editor-first2=James |editor-last2=O'Connell |title=Contemporary Irish Studies |isbn=0-7190-0919-7 |publisher=[[Manchester University Press]] |via=[[Conflict Archive on the Internet]] |year=1983 |access-date=30 April 2019}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |url= http://cain.ulst.ac.uk/hmso/cmd380.htm |title=Fair Employment in Northern Ireland |isbn=0-10-103802-X |year= 1988 |access-date=23 October 2008 |author=Northern Ireland Office |publisher=Her Majesty's Stationery Office |via=Conflict Archive on the Internet|author-link=Northern Ireland Office }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://cain.ulst.ac.uk/events/crights/nicra/nicra78.htm |title='We Shall Overcome' ...

Other groups, on both the unionist side and the nationalist side, participated in violence and a period known as [[the Troubles]] began. Over 3,600 deaths resulted over the subsequent three decades of conflict.<ref>{{Cite news |url= http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/northern_ireland/467904.stm |title=Turning the pages on lost lives |work=BBC News Online |access-date=4 January 2010 |date=8 October 1999}}</ref> Owing to the civil unrest during the Troubles, the British government suspended home rule in 1972 and imposed [[Direct rule over Northern Ireland|direct rule]]. There were several unsuccessful attempts to end the Troubles politically, such as the [[Sunningdale Agreement]] of 1973. In 1998, following a ceasefire by the Provisional IRA and multi-party talks, the [[Good Friday Agreement]] was concluded as a treaty between the British and Irish governments, annexing the text agreed in the multi-party talks.

The substance of the Agreement (formally referred to as the Belfast Agreement) was later endorsed by referendums in both parts of Ireland. The Agreement restored self-government to Northern Ireland on the basis of power-sharing in a regional [[Northern Ireland Executive|Executive]] drawn from the major parties in a new [[Northern Ireland Assembly]], with entrenched protections for the two main communities. The Executive is jointly headed by a [[First Minister and deputy First Minister]] drawn from the unionist and nationalist parties. Violence had decreased greatly after the Provisional IRA and loyalist ceasefires in 1994 and in 2005 the Provisional IRA announced the end of its armed campaign and an [[Independent International Commission on Decommissioning|independent commission]] supervised its disarmament and that of other nationalist and unionist paramilitary organisations.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://cain.ulst.ac.uk/events/peace/decommission/iicd190106.pdf |first1=Tauno |last1=Nieminen |first2=John |last2=de Chastelain |author3=Andrew D. Sens |title=Independent International Commission on Decommissioning |access-date=15 October 2008}}</ref>

The Assembly and power-sharing Executive were suspended several times but were restored again in 2007. In that year the British government officially ended its military support of the police in Northern Ireland ([[Operation Banner]]) and began withdrawing troops.
On 27 June 2012, Northern Ireland's deputy first minister and former IRA commander, [[Martin McGuinness]], shook hands with Queen Elizabeth II in Belfast, symbolising reconciliation between the two sides.

==Politics==
{{main|Politics of Ireland}}
[[File:Map of Ireland's capitals.png|thumb|upright|Political entities on the island of Ireland]]
The island is divided between the Republic of Ireland, an independent [[Sovereign state|state]], and Northern Ireland (a constituent country of the [[United Kingdom]]). They share an [[Irish border|open border]] and both are part of the [[Common Travel Area]].

The Republic of Ireland is a member of the [[European Union]] while the United Kingdom is a former member, having both acceded to its precursor entity, the European Economic Community [EEC], in 1973, and as a consequence there is [[internal market|free movement of people, goods, services and capital]] across the border.

===Republic of Ireland===
[[File:Áras an Uachtaráin 2010.jpg|thumb|{{lang|ga|[[Áras an Uachtaráin]]}}, the official residence of the [[President of Ireland]]]]
The [[Republic of Ireland]] is a [[parliamentary democracy]] based on the British model, with a [[Constitution of Ireland|written constitution]] and a popularly elected president who has mostly ceremonial powers. The [[Government of Ireland|government]] is headed by a prime minister, the [[Taoiseach]], who is appointed by the [[President of Ireland|President]] on the nomination of the lower house of parliament, the [[Dáil Éireann|''Dáil'']]. Members of the government are chosen from both the {{lang|ga|Dáil}} and the upper house of parliament, the [[Seanad Éireann|''Seanad'']]. Its capital is [[Dublin]].

The republic today ranks amongst the wealthiest countries in the world in terms of [[GDP per capita]]<ref>{{cite web |title=Country Comparison: GDP&nbsp;– per capita (PPP) |url= https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/rankorder/2004rank.html?countryName=Ireland&countryCode=ei&regionCode=eur&rank=27#ei |website=World Factbook |publisher=Central Intelligence Agency |access-date=29 August 2011}}</ref> and in 2015 was ranked the sixth most developed nation in the world by the United Nations' [[Human Development Index]].<ref>{{cite web |url= http://hdr.undp.org/sites/default/files/2015_human_development_report.pdf |page=47 |title=Human Development Report 2015: Table A1.1 |publisher=[[United Nations Development Programme]] (UNDP) |date=2015 |website=Human Development Index and its components |access-date=30 November 2016}}</ref> A period of rapid economic expansion from 1995 onwards became known as the [[Celtic Tiger]] period, was brought to an end in 2008 with an unprecedented [[Post-2008 Irish economic downturn|financial crisis]] and an economic depression in 2009.

===Northern Ireland===
[[File:StormontCarson.jpg|thumb|[[Parliament Buildings (Northern Ireland)|Parliament Buildings]], in [[Stormont Estate]], seat of the [[Northern Ireland Assembly]]]]
[[Northern Ireland]] is a part of the [[United Kingdom]] with a local [[Northern Ireland Executive|executive]] and [[Northern Ireland Assembly|assembly]] which exercise devolved powers. The executive is jointly headed by the first and deputy first minister, with the ministries being allocated in proportion with each party's representation in the assembly. Its capital is [[Belfast]].

Ultimately political power is held by the [[UK government]], from which Northern Ireland has gone through intermittent periods of direct rule during which devolved powers have been suspended. Northern Ireland elects 18 of the UK [[House of Commons of the United Kingdom|House of Commons]]' 650 MPs. The [[Northern Ireland Secretary]] is a cabinet-level post in the British government.

Along with [[England and Wales]] and with Scotland, Northern Ireland forms one of the three separate legal jurisdictions of the UK, all of which share the [[Supreme Court of the United Kingdom]] as their court of final appeal.

===All-island institutions===
As part of the Good Friday Agreement, the British and Irish governments agreed on the creation of all-island institutions and areas of cooperation. The [[North/South Ministerial Council]] is an institution through which ministers from the Government of Ireland and the Northern Ireland Executive agree all-island policies. At least six of these policy areas must have an associated all-island "implementation bodies," and at least six others must be implemented separately in each jurisdiction. The implementation bodies are: [[Waterways Ireland]], the [[Food Safety Promotion Board]], [[InterTradeIreland]], the [[Special European Union Programmes Body]], [[the North/South Language Body]] and the [[Commissioners of Irish Lights|Foyle, Carlingford and Irish Lights Commission]].

The [[British–Irish Intergovernmental Conference]] provides for co-operation between the Government of Ireland and the Government of the United Kingdom on all matters of mutual interest, especially Northern Ireland. In light of the Republic's particular interest in the governance of Northern Ireland, "regular and frequent" meetings co-chaired by the ROI Minister for Foreign Affairs and the UK Secretary of State for Northern Ireland, dealing with non-devolved matters to do with Northern Ireland and non-devolved [[all-Ireland]] issues, are required to take place under the establishing treaty.

The [[North/South Inter-Parliamentary Association]] is a joint parliamentary forum for the island of Ireland. It has no formal powers but operates as a forum for discussing matters of common concern between the respective legislatures.

==Economy==
{{Main|Economy of the Republic of Ireland|Economy of Northern Ireland}}
{{See also|International Financial Services Centre}}
Despite the two jurisdictions using two distinct currencies (the [[euro]] and [[pound sterling]]), a growing amount of commercial activity is carried out on an all-Ireland basis. This has been facilitated by the two jurisdictions' shared membership of the European Union, and there have been calls from members of the business community and policymakers for the creation of an "all-Ireland economy" to take advantage of [[economies of scale]] and boost competitiveness.<ref>{{cite web |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20081028204341/http://www.forfas.ie/ncc/reports/ncc_ndp_submission/ncc061114_ndp_submission_dept_finance_webopt.pdf |archive-date=28 October 2008 |url= http://www.forfas.ie/ncc/reports/ncc_ndp_submission/ncc061114_ndp_submission_dept_finance_webopt.pdf |date=2006 |title=National Competitiveness Council Submission on the National Development Plan 2007–2013 |publisher=National Competitiveness Council |url-status=dead |access-date=28 October 2016}}</ref>

===Energy===

]]
Ireland has an ancient industry based on [[peat]] (known locally as "turf") as a source of energy for home fires. A form of [[biomass]] energy, this source of heat is still widely used in [[rural]] areas. However, because of the ecological importance of peatlands in storing carbon and their rarity, the EU is attempting to protect this habitat by fining Ireland for digging up peat. In cities, heat is generally supplied by [[natural gas]] or [[heating oil]], although some urban suppliers distribute sods of turf as "smokeless fuel" for domestic use.

The island operates as a single market for electricity.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.sem-o.com/AboutSEMO/Pages/default.aspx |title= About SEMO: The Single Electricity Market |publisher= Single Electricity Market Operator (SEMO) |access-date= 13 January 2011 |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20101130095246/http://www.sem-o.com/AboutSEMO/Pages/default.aspx |archive-date= 30 November 2010 |url-status= dead }}</ref> For much of their existence, electricity networks in the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland were entirely separate. Both networks were designed and constructed independently post-partition. However, they are now connected with three interlinks<ref>{{cite web | url= http://www.cer.ie/en/electricity-transmission-network-interconnection.aspx |title= Interconnection |publisher= Commission for Energy Regulation |date= 28 January 2011 | archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20110128172244/http://www.cer.ie/en/electricity-transmission-network-interconnection.aspx |archive-date= 28 January 2011 |access-date= 30 March 2010}}</ref> and also connected through Great Britain to mainland Europe. The situation in Northern Ireland is complicated by the issue of private companies not supplying [[Northern Ireland Electricity]] with enough power. In the Republic of Ireland, the [[ESB Group|ESB]] has failed to modernise its power stations, and the availability of power plants has recently averaged only 66%, one of the worst such rates in Western Europe. [[EirGrid]] has started building a [[High-voltage direct current|HVDC]] transmission line between Ireland and Great Britain with a capacity of 500 MW,<ref>{{cite web |title= Interconnection: East-West Interconnector |publisher= [[EirGrid]] |url= http://www.eirgridgroup.com/customer-and-industry/interconnection/ |access-date= 19 September 2016}}</ref> about 10% of Ireland's peak demand.

=== Geology ===
The island consists of varied [[geologic province|geological provinces]]. In the west, around County Galway and [[County Donegal]], is a medium to high grade metamorphic and igneous complex of [[Caledonides|Caledonide]] affinity, similar to the [[Scottish Highlands]]. Across southeast Ulster and extending southwest to [[Longford]] and south to [[Navan]] is a province of [[Ordovician]] and [[Silurian]] rocks, with similarities to the [[Southern Uplands]] province of Scotland. Further south, along the [[County Wexford]] coastline, is an area of granite [[intrusion|intrusives]] into more Ordovician and Silurian rocks, like that found in Wales.<ref>{{cite web |title=Geology of Ireland |website=Geology for Everyone |publisher=Geological Survey of Ireland |url= http://www.gsi.ie/Education/Geology+for+Everyone/Geology+of+Ireland.htm |access-date=5 November 2008 |url-status=dead |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20080327113851/http://www.gsi.ie/Education/Geology%2Bfor%2BEveryone/Geology%2Bof%2BIreland.htm |archive-date=27 March 2008 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=Bedrock Geology of Ireland |website=Geology for Everyone |publisher=Geological Survey of Ireland |url= http://www.gsi.ie/NR/rdonlyres/0302F251-C4ED-4938-BCF0-CF228A3E8F6A/0/GSI_GeolIreland_A4.pdf |access-date=5 November 2008}}</ref>

===Climate===
{{Main|Climate of Ireland}}

The island's lush vegetation, a product of its mild climate and frequent rainfall, earns it the sobriquet ''the Emerald Isle''. Overall, Ireland has a mild but changeable [[oceanic climate]] with few extremes. The climate is typically insular and is [[Temperate climate|temperate]], avoiding the extremes in temperature of many other areas in the world at similar latitudes.<ref name="MEclimate">{{cite web |title=Climate of Ireland |website=Climate |publisher={{lang|ga|Met Éireann}}|url= http://www.met.ie/climate/climate-of-ireland.asp |access-date=11 November 2008}}</ref> This is a result of the moderating moist winds which ordinarily prevail from the southwestern Atlantic.

Precipitation falls throughout the year but is light overall, particularly in the east. The west tends to be wetter on average and prone to Atlantic storms, especially in the late autumn and winter months. These occasionally bring destructive winds and higher total rainfall to these areas, as well as sometimes snow and hail. The regions of north County Galway and east County Mayo have the highest incidents of recorded lightning annually for the island, with lightning occurring approximately five to ten days per year in these areas.<ref name="MErainfall">{{cite web |title=Rainfall |website=Climate |publisher={{lang|ga|Met Éireann}} |url= http://www.met.ie/climate/rainfall.asp |access-date=5 November 2008}}</ref> [[Munster]], in the south, records the least snow whereas [[Ulster]], in the north, records the most.

Inland areas are warmer in summer and colder in winter. Usually around 40 days of the year are below freezing {{nowrap|0&nbsp;°C}} {{nowrap|(32&nbsp;°F)}} at inland [[weather station]]s, compared to 10 days at coastal stations. Ireland is sometimes affected by heatwaves, most recently in 1995, [[2003 European heat wave|2003]], [[2006 European heat wave#Ireland|2006]], 2013 and [[2018 British Isles heat wave|2018]]. In common with the rest of Europe, Ireland experienced unusually cold weather during [[Winter of 2010–11 in Great Britain and Ireland|the winter of 2010-11]]. Temperatures fell as low as −17.2&nbsp;°C (1&nbsp;°F) in County Mayo on 20 December<ref>{{cite news |url= http://www.independent.ie/irish-news/subzero-temperatures-make-2010-a-recordbreaking-year-26609480.html |title=Sub-zero temperatures make 2010 a record-breaking year |first=Kevin |last=Keane |work=[[Irish Independent]] |date=28 December 2010 |access-date=21 July 2011}}</ref> and up to a metre (3&nbsp;ft) of snow fell in mountainous areas.

Because Ireland became isolated from [[mainland Europe]] by rising sea levels before the [[Last Glacial Period|last ice age]] had completely finished, it has fewer land animal and plant species than Great Britain or mainland Europe. There are [[List of mammals of Ireland|55 mammal species]] in Ireland, and of them only 26 land mammal species are considered native to Ireland.<ref name="Costello, M.J 93" >Costello, M.J. and Kelly, K.S., 1993 ''Biogeography of Ireland: past, present and future'' Irish Biogeographic Society Occasional Publications Number 2</ref> Some species, such as, the [[red fox]], [[European hedgehog|hedgehog]] and [[European badger|badger]], are very common, whereas others, like the [[Mountain hare|Irish hare]], [[red deer]] and [[pine marten]] are less so. Aquatic wildlife, such as species of sea turtle, shark, seal, whale, and dolphin, are common off the coast. About 400 species of birds have been recorded in Ireland. Many of these are migratory, including the [[barn swallow]].

Several different habitat types are found in Ireland, including farmland, open woodland, [[temperate broadleaf and mixed forests]], [[conifer]] plantations, [[peat]] bogs and a variety of coastal habitats. However, agriculture drives current land use patterns in Ireland, limiting natural habitat preserves,<ref name="www2000">{{cite web |title=Land cover and land use |website=Environmental Assessment |publisher=Environmental Protection Agency [Ireland] |location=Wexford |date=2011 |url= http://www.epa.ie/whatwedo/assessment/land/ |access-date=15 August 2011}}</ref> particularly for larger wild mammals with greater territorial needs. With no large [[apex predator]]s in Ireland other than humans and dogs, such populations of animals as semi-wild deer that cannot be controlled by smaller predators, such as the fox, are controlled by annual [[culling]].

There are no snakes in Ireland, and only one species of reptile (the [[Viviparous lizard|common lizard]]) is native to the island. Extinct species include the [[Irish elk]], the [[great auk]], [[brown bear]] and the [[Wolves in Ireland|wolf]]. Some previously extinct birds, such as the [[golden eagle]], have been reintroduced after decades of [[Local extinction|extirpation]].<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.epa.ie/pubs/reports/indicators/epa_indicators_2002.pdf |title=Environment in Focus 2002: Key Environmental Indicators for Ireland |editor1=M Lehane |editor2=O Le Bolloch |editor3=P Crawley |access-date=28 October 2016}}</ref>

Much of the land is now covered with pasture and there are many species of wild-flower. Gorse (''[[Ulex europaeus]]''), a wild [[furze]], is commonly found growing in the uplands and ferns are plentiful in the more moist regions, especially in the western parts. It is home to hundreds of plant species, some of them unique to the island, and has been "invaded" by some grasses, such as ''[[Spartina anglica]]''.<ref>{{cite web |last=Hackney |first=Paul |url=http://www.habitas.org.uk/invasive/species.asp?item=2680 |title=Spartina Anglica |website=Invasive Alien Species in Northern Ireland |access-date=1 January 2009 |publisher=National Museums Northern Ireland |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110519055358/http://www.habitas.org.uk/invasive/species.asp?item=2680 |archive-date=19 May 2011 |url-status=dead  }}</ref>

Because of its mild climate, many species, including [[subtropics|sub-tropical]] species such as [[Arecaceae|palm trees]], are grown in Ireland. [[Phytogeography|Phytogeographically]], Ireland belongs to the Atlantic European province of the [[Circumboreal Region]] within the [[Boreal Kingdom]]. The island can be subdivided into two [[ecoregion]]s: the Celtic broadleaf forests and North Atlantic moist mixed forests.

===Impact of agriculture===
[[File:Pasture at the Viewpoint - geograph.org.uk - 15065.jpg|thumb|[[Bantry]], [[County Cork]]]]
The long history of agricultural production, coupled with modern intensive agricultural methods such as pesticide and fertiliser use and runoff from contaminants into streams, rivers and lakes, has placed pressure on biodiversity in Ireland.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.clarecoco.ie/water-waste-environment/biodiversity/ |title=Biodiversity |publisher=Clare County Council |access-date=26 March 2010}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.belfasthills.org/minisite/adult_version/draftottersapmar07-2.pdf |title=Otter Lutra Lutra |website=Northern Ireland Species Action Plan |publisher=Environment and Heritage Service |date=2007 |access-date=1 January 2010 |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20110205005310/http://www.belfasthills.org/minisite/adult_version/draftottersapmar07-2.pdf |url-status=dead |archive-date=5 February 2011}}</ref> A land of green fields for crop cultivation and cattle rearing limits the space available for the establishment of native wild species. Hedgerows, however, traditionally used for maintaining and demarcating land boundaries, act as a refuge for native wild flora. This ecosystem stretches across the countryside and acts as a network of connections to preserve remnants of the ecosystem that once covered the island. Subsidies under the [[Common Agricultural Policy]], which supported agricultural practices that preserved hedgerow environments, are undergoing reforms. The Common Agricultural Policy had in the past subsidised potentially destructive agricultural practices, for example by emphasising production without placing limits on indiscriminate use of fertilisers and pesticides; but reforms have gradually decoupled subsidies from production levels and introduced environmental and other requirements.<ref name="cap_reforms">{{cite web |title=CAP Reform – A Long-term Perspective for Sustainable Agriculture |website=Agriculture and Rural Development |publisher=European Commission |url= http://ec.europa.eu/agriculture/cap-post-2013/index_en.htm |access-date=30 July 2007}}</ref> 32% of Ireland's greenhouse gas emissions are correlated to agriculture.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.epa.ie/irelandsenvironment/climate/|title=Climate Change Causes|date=2014|publisher=[[Environmental Protection Agency (Ireland)]]|access-date=4 December 2017}}</ref>[[File:Population density of Ireland map2002.svg|thumb|upright=1|A [[Population density]] map of Ireland 2002 showing the heavily weighted eastern seaboard and Ulster]]Forested areas typically consist of monoculture plantations of non-native species, which may result in habitats that are not suitable for supporting native species of invertebrates.

People have lived in Ireland for over 9,000 years. Early historical and genealogical records note the existence of major groups such as the {{lang|ga|[[Cruthin]]}}, {{lang|ga|[[Corcu Loígde]]}}, {{lang|ga|[[Dál Riata]]}}, {{lang|ga|[[Dáirine]]}}, {{lang|ga|[[Deirgtine]]}}, {{lang|ga|[[Delbhna]]}}, {{lang|ga|[[Érainn]]}}, {{lang|ga|[[Laigin]]}}, {{lang|ga|[[Ulaid]]}}. Later major groups included the {{lang|ga|[[Connachta]]}}, {{lang|ga|[[Ciannachta]]}}, {{lang|ga|[[Eóganachta]]}}. Smaller groups included the {{lang|ga|aithechthúatha}} (see {{lang|ga|[[Attacotti]]}}), {{lang|ga|[[Cálraighe]]}}, {{lang|ga|[[Cíarraige]]}}, {{lang|ga|[[Conmaicne]]}}, {{lang|ga|[[Dartraighe]]}}, {{lang|ga|[[Déisi]]}}, {{lang|ga|[[Éile]]}}, {{lang|ga|[[Fir Bolg]]}}, {{lang|ga|[[Fortuatha]]}}, {{lang|ga|[[Gailenga]]}}, {{lang|ga|[[Gamanraige]]}}, {{lang|ga|[[Mairtine]]}}, {{lang|ga|[[Múscraige]]}}, {{lang|ga|[[Partraige]]}}, {{lang|ga|[[Soghain]]}}, {{lang|ga|[[Uaithni]]}}, {{lang|ga|[[Uí Maine]]}}, {{lang|ga|[[Uí Liatháin]]}}. Many survived into late medieval times, others vanished as they became politically unimportant. Over the past 1,200 years, [[Vikings]], [[Normans]], [[Welsh people|Welsh]], [[Flemings]], [[Scottish people|Scots]], [[English people|English]], [[Africans]], [[Eastern Europeans]] and [[South Americans]] have all added to the population and have had significant influences on Irish culture.

The population of Ireland rose rapidly from the 16th century until the mid-19th century, interrupted briefly by the [[Irish Famine (1740–41)|Famine of 1740–41]], which killed roughly two fifths of the island's population. The population rebounded and multiplied over the next century, but the [[Great Famine (Ireland)|Great Famine]] of the 1840s caused one million deaths and forced over one million more to emigrate in its immediate wake. Over the following century, the population was reduced by over half, at a time when the general trend in European countries was for populations to rise by an average of three-fold.

Ireland's largest religious group is [[Christianity]]. The largest denomination is [[Roman Catholicism]], representing over 73% for the island (and about 87% of the Republic of Ireland). Most of the rest of the population adhere to one of the various [[Protestant]] denominations (about 48% of Northern Ireland).<ref name="niprotestants">{{Cite news |last=McKittrick |first=David |title=Census Reveals Northern Ireland's Protestant Population is at Record Low |work=[[The Independent]] |date=19 December 2002 |url= https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/home-news/census-reveals-northern-irelands-protestant-population-is-at-record-low-611500.html |access-date=30 December 2009 |location=London |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20110624101635/http://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/home-news/census-reveals-northern-irelands-protestant-population-is-at-record-low-611500.html |archive-date=24 June 2011}}</ref> The largest is the [[Anglicanism|Anglican]] [[Church of Ireland]].

City status in Ireland is decided by [[legislation|legislative]] or [[royal charter]]. [[Dublin]], with over 1 million residents in the [[Greater Dublin Area]], is the largest city on the island. Belfast, with 579,726 residents, is the largest city in Northern Ireland. City status does not directly equate with population size. For example, [[Armagh]], with 14,590 is the seat of the [[Church of Ireland]] and the [[Roman Catholic]] [[Primate of All Ireland]] and was re-granted [[City status in the United Kingdom#Northern Ireland|city status]] by [[Elizabeth II of the United Kingdom|Queen Elizabeth II]] in 1994 (having lost that status in [[Municipal Corporations (Ireland) Act 1840|local government reforms of 1840]]). In the Republic of Ireland, [[Kilkenny]], seat of the [[Butler dynasty]], while no longer a city for administrative purposes (since the 2001 [[Local Government Act 2001|Local Government Act]]), is entitled by law to continue to use the description.

===Migration===
[[File:Population of Ireland since 1500.png|thumb|upright=1.5|The population of Ireland since 1603 showing the consequence of the [[Great Famine (Ireland)|Great Famine (1845–52)]] (Note: figures before 1841 are contemporary estimates)]]

The population of Ireland collapsed dramatically during the second half of the 19th century. A population of over 8 million in 1841 was reduced to slightly more than 4 million by 1921. In part, the fall in population was caused by death from the [[Great Famine (Ireland)|Great Famine]] of 1845 to 1852, which took about 1 million lives. However, by far the greater cause of population decline was the dire economic state of the country which led to an entrenched culture of emigration lasting until the 21st century.

Emigration from Ireland in the 19th century contributed to the populations of England, the United States, Canada and Australia, in all of which a large [[Irish diaspora]] lives. {{As of|2006}}, 4.3 million Canadians, or 14% of the population, were of Irish descent,<ref>"[http://www12.statcan.ca/census-recensement/2006/dp-pd/hlt/97-562/pages/page.cfm?Lang=E&Geo=PR&Code=01&Table=2&Data=Count&StartRec=1&Sort=3&Display=All&CSDFilter=5000 Ethnic origins, 2006 counts, for Canada, provinces and territories – 20% sample data]".

===Languages===
{{main|Languages of Ireland}}
[[File:Irish speakers in 2011.png|thumb|upright=1.15|Proportion of respondents who said they could speak Irish in the Ireland census in 2011 or the Northern Ireland census in 2011]]
The two official languages of the Republic of Ireland are Irish and English. Each language has produced noteworthy literature. Irish, though now only the language of a minority, was the vernacular of the Irish people for thousands of years and was possibly introduced during the [[Iron Age]]. It began to be written down after Christianisation in the 5th century and spread to Scotland and the Isle of Man, where it evolved into the [[Scottish Gaelic]] and [[Manx Language|Manx]] languages respectively.

The Irish language has a vast treasury of written texts from many centuries and is divided by linguists into [[Old Irish]] from the 6th to 10th century, [[Middle Irish]] from the 10th to 13th century, Early Modern Irish until the 17th century, and the Modern Irish spoken today. It remained the dominant language of Ireland for most of those periods, having influences from [[Latin Language|Latin]], [[Old Norse]], [[Anglo-Norman language|French]] and English. It declined under British rule but remained the majority tongue until the early 19th century, and since then has been a minority language.

The [[Gaelic Revival]] of the early 20th century has had a long-term influence. Irish is taught in mainstream Irish schools as a compulsory subject, but teaching methods have been criticised for their ineffectiveness, with the lack of level of ability after, typically, fourteen years of instruction cited.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://universitytimes.ie/?p=1707 |title=Head-to-Head: The Irish Language Debate |work=UniversityTimes.ie |date=21 February 2011 |access-date=31 March 2015}}</ref>

There is now a network of urban Irish speakers in both the Republic and Northern Ireland, especially in Dublin and Belfast,{{citation needed|date=January 2019}} with the children of such Irish speakers sometimes attending Irish-medium schools ({{lang|ga|[[Gaelscoil]]|Gaelscoileanna}}). It has been argued that they tend to be more highly educated than monolingual English speakers.<ref name="cso.ie">{{cite web |url=http://www.cso.ie/en/media/csoie/census/documents/census2011profile9/Profile,9,What,we,know,Press,Statement.pdf |title=Press Statement: Census 2011 Results |website=CSO.ie |publisher=Central Statistics Office |date=22 November 2012 |location=Dublin |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160328211550/http://www.cso.ie/en/media/csoie/census/documents/census2011profile9/Profile,9,What,we,know,Press,Statement.pdf |archive-date=28 March 2016 |url-status=dead |access-date=6 October 2017  }}</ref> Recent research suggests that urban Irish is developing in a direction of its own, both in pronunciation and grammar.<ref name="irishtimes.com">{{cite news |first==Brian |last=Ó Broin |title=Schism fears for Gaeilgeoirí |url= http://www.irishtimes.com/newspaper/weekend/2010/0116/1224262447899.html |work=[[Irish Times]] |access-date=31 March 2015}}</ref>

Traditional rural Irish-speaking areas, known collectively as the {{lang|ga|[[Gaeltacht]]}}, are in linguistic decline. The main {{lang|ga|Gaeltacht}} areas are in the west, south-west and north-west. They are to be found in Donegal, Mayo, Galway, western Cork and Kerry with smaller {{lang|ga|Gaeltacht}} areas near [[Dungarvan]] in Waterford, [[Navan]] in Meath.<ref>{{cite web |title=Where are Ireland's Gaeltacht areas? |website=FAQ |publisher={{lang|ga|[[Údarás na Gaeltachta]]}} |date=2015 |url= http://www.udaras.ie/en/faoin-laithrean-seo/ceisteanna-coitianta |access-date=9 September 2015}}</ref>

[[Hiberno-English|English in Ireland]] was first introduced during the Norman invasion. It was spoken by a few peasants and merchants brought over from England, and was largely replaced by Irish before the Tudor conquest of Ireland. It was introduced as the official language with the Tudor and Cromwellian conquests. The Ulster plantations gave it a permanent foothold in Ulster, and it remained the official and upper-class language elsewhere, the Irish-speaking chieftains and nobility having been deposed. Language shift during the 19th century replaced Irish with English as the first language for a vast majority of the population.<ref>{{cite book |last=Spolsky |first=Bernard |title=Language policy |publisher=Cambridge University Press |date=2004 |page=191 |isbn=978-0-521-01175-4}}</ref>

Less than 10% of the population of the Republic of Ireland today speak Irish regularly outside of the education system<ref>{{cite web |title=Table 15: Irish speakers aged 3 years and over in each Province, County and City, classified by frequency of speaking Irish, 2006 |website=Census 2006 |volume=Volume 9 – Irish Language |publisher=Central Statistics Office |url=http://beyond2020.cso.ie/Census/TableViewer/tableView.aspx?ReportId=75639 |access-date=9 November 2008 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090227165829/http://beyond2020.cso.ie/Census/TableViewer/tableView.aspx?ReportId=75639 |archive-date=27 February 2009  }}</ref> and 38% of those over 15 years are classified as "Irish speakers". In Northern Ireland, English is the de facto official language, but official recognition is afforded to Irish, including specific protective measures under Part III of the [[European Charter for Regional or Minority Languages]]. A lesser status (including recognition under Part II of the Charter) is given to [[Ulster Scots dialects]], which are spoken by roughly 2% of Northern Ireland residents, and also spoken by some in the Republic of Ireland.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.ark.ac.uk/nilt/1999/Community_Relations/USPKULST.html |title=Northern Ireland Life and Times Survey, 1999 |publisher=Access Research Knowledge Northern Ireland (Queen's University Belfast / Ulster University) |date=9 May 2003 |access-date=20 October 2013}}</ref> Since the 1960s with the increase in immigration, many more languages have been introduced, particularly deriving from Asia and Eastern Europe.

Ireland's culture comprises elements of the culture of ancient peoples, later immigrant and broadcast cultural influences (chiefly [[Gaels|Gaelic culture]], [[Anglicisation]], [[Americanisation]] and aspects of broader [[European culture]]). In broad terms, Ireland is regarded as one of the [[Celtic nations]] of Europe, alongside Scotland, Wales, Cornwall, [[Isle of Man]] and [[Brittany]]. This combination of cultural influences is visible in the intricate designs termed ''Irish [[Interlace (visual arts)|interlace]]'' or ''[[Celtic knot]]work.'' These can be seen in the ornamentation of medieval religious and secular works. The style is still popular today in jewellery and graphic art,<ref name="BBC 1">{{cite news |title=Tionchar na gCeilteach |url= http://www.bbc.co.uk/irish/articles/view/720/english/ |access-date=23 January 2010 |date=23 May 2009 |work=BBC News Online}}</ref> as is the distinctive style of [[traditional Irish music]] and dance, and has become indicative of modern "Celtic" culture in general.

[[Religion in Ireland|Religion]] has played a significant role in the cultural life of the island since ancient times (and since the 17th century [[Plantations of Ireland|plantations]], has been the focus of political identity and divisions on the island). Ireland's pre-Christian heritage fused with the [[Celtic Church]] following the missions of [[Saint Patrick]] in the 5th century. The [[Hiberno-Scottish mission]]s, begun by the Irish monk Saint [[Columba]], spread the [[Celtic Christianity|Irish vision of Christianity]] to [[pagan]] [[Anglo-Saxon England|England]] and the [[Frankish Empire]]. These missions brought written language to an illiterate population of Europe during the Dark Ages that followed the [[fall of Rome]], earning Ireland the sobriquet, "the island of saints and scholars".

Since the 20th century [[Irish pub]]s worldwide have become outposts of Irish culture, especially those with a full range of cultural and gastronomic offerings.

The Republic of Ireland's national theatre is the [[Abbey Theatre]], which was founded in 1904, and the national Irish-language theatre is {{lang|ga|[[An Taibhdhearc]]}}, which was established in 1928 in [[Galway]].<ref>{{cite web |title=Stair na Taibhdheirce |publisher={{lang|ga|An Taibhdheirce}} |date=2014 |url= http://antaibhdhearc.com/theatre-info/fuinn/ |access-date= 28 May 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=An Taibhdhearc |publisher=Fodor's |url= http://www.fodors.com/world/europe/ireland/county-clare-galway-and-the-aran-islands |access-date=4 October 2014 |url-status=dead |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20141002060446/http://www.fodors.com/world/europe/ireland/county-clare-galway-and-the-aran-islands/ |archive-date=2 October 2014}}</ref> Playwrights such as [[Seán O'Casey]], [[Brian Friel]], [[Sebastian Barry]], [[Conor McPherson]] and [[Billy Roche]] are internationally renowned.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Houston |first=Eugenie |title=Working and Living in Ireland |publisher=Working and Living Publications |date=2001 |isbn=978-0-9536896-8-2 |page=[https://archive.org/details/workinglivingini00euge/page/253 253] |url=https://archive.org/details/workinglivingini00euge/page/253 }}</ref>

====Literature====
Ireland has made a large contribution to world literature in all its branches, both in Irish and English. Poetry in Irish is among the oldest [[vernacular literature|vernacular poetry]] in Europe, with the earliest examples dating from the 6th century.
Irish remained the dominant literary language down to the nineteenth century, despite the spread of English from the seventeenth century on. Prominent names from the medieval period and later include {{lang|ga|[[Gofraidh Fionn Ó Dálaigh]]}} (fourteenth century), {{lang|ga|[[Dáibhí Ó Bruadair]]}} (seventeenth century) and [[Aogán Ó Rathaille]] (eighteenth century). {{lang|ga|[[Eibhlín Dubh Ní Chonaill]]}} (c. 1743 – c. 1800) was an outstanding poet in the oral tradition. The latter part of the nineteenth century saw a rapid replacement of Irish by English. By 1900, however, cultural nationalists had begun the [[Gaelic revival]], which saw the beginnings of modern literature in Irish. This was to produce a number of notable writers, including {{lang|ga|[[Máirtín Ó Cadhain]]}}, {{lang|ga|[[Máire Mhac an tSaoi]]}} and others. Irish-language publishers such as {{lang|ga|[[Coiscéim]]}} and {{lang|ga|[[Cló Iar-Chonnacht]]}} continue to produce scores of titles every year.

In English, [[Jonathan Swift]], often called the foremost [[satirist]] in the English language, gained fame for works such as ''[[Gulliver's Travels]]'' and ''[[A Modest Proposal]]''. Other notable 18th-century writers of Irish origin included [[Oliver Goldsmith]] and [[Richard Brinsley Sheridan]], though they spent most of their lives in England. The Anglo-Irish novel came to the fore in the nineteenth century, featuring such writers as [[Charles Kickham]], [[William Carleton]], and (in collaboration) [[Edith Somerville]] and [[Violet Florence Martin]]. The playwright and poet [[Oscar Wilde]], noted for his epigrams, was born in Ireland.

In the 20th century, Ireland produced four winners of the [[Nobel Prize for Literature]]: [[George Bernard Shaw]], [[William Butler Yeats]], [[Samuel Beckett]] and [[Seamus Heaney]]. Although not a [[Nobel Prize]] winner, [[James Joyce]] is widely considered to be one of the most significant writers of the 20th century. Joyce's 1922 novel ''[[Ulysses (novel)|Ulysses]]'' is considered one of the most important works of [[Modernist literature]] and his life is celebrated annually on 16 June in Dublin as "[[Bloomsday]]".<ref>{{cite web |title=What is Bloomsday? |publisher=James Joyce Centre |url= http://jamesjoyce.ie/what-is-bloomsday/ |access-date=4 October 2014 |url-status=dead |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20140916080551/http://jamesjoyce.ie/what-is-bloomsday/ |archive-date=16 September 2014}}</ref> A comparable writer in Irish is {{lang|ga|[[Máirtín Ó Cadhain]]}}, whose novel {{lang|ga|[[Cré na Cille]]}} is regarded as a modernist masterpiece and has been translated into several languages.

Modern Irish literature is often connected with its rural heritage<ref>{{Cite book |first=Andrew |last=Higgins Wyndham |title=Re-imagining Ireland |publisher=University of Virginia Press |location=Charlottesville |date=2006}}</ref> through English-language writers such as [[John McGahern]] and [[Seamus Heaney]] and Irish-language writers such as {{lang|ga|[[Máirtín Ó Direáin]]}} and others from the {{lang|ga|[[Gaeltacht]]}}.

====Music====
Music has been in evidence in Ireland since prehistoric times.<ref>O'Dwyer, Simon: ''Prehistoric Music in Ireland'' (Stroud, Gloucestershire: Tempus Publishing, 2004), {{ISBN|0-7524-3129-3}}.</ref> Although in the early Middle Ages the church was "quite unlike its counterpart in continental Europe",<ref>Brannon, Patrick V.: "Medieval Ireland: Music in Cathedral, Church and Cloister", in: ''Early Music'' 28.2 (May 2000), p. 193.</ref> there was considerable interchange between monastic settlements in Ireland and the rest of Europe that contributed to what is known as [[Gregorian chant]]. Outside religious establishments, musical genres in early Gaelic Ireland are referred to as a triad of weeping music (''goltraige''), laughing music (''geantraige'') and sleeping music (''suantraige'').<ref>Buckley, Ann: "Medieval Ireland, Music in", in: ''The Encyclopaedia of Music in Ireland'', ed. by [[Harry White (musicologist)|Harry White]] and Barra Boydell (Dublin: UCD Press, 2013), {{ISBN|978-1-906359-78-2}}, p. 659.</ref> Vocal and instrumental music (e.g. for the harp, pipes, and various [[string instrument]]s) was transmitted orally, but the [[Irish harp]], in particular, was of such significance that it became Ireland's national symbol. Classical music following European models first developed in urban areas, in establishments of Anglo-Irish rule such as [[Dublin Castle]], [[St Patrick's Cathedral, Dublin|St Patrick's Cathedral]] and [[Christ Church Cathedral, Dublin|Christ Church]] as well as the country houses of the Anglo-Irish ascendancy, with the first performance of [[George Frideric Handel|Handel]]'s ''[[Messiah (Handel)|Messiah]]'' (1742) being among the highlights of the baroque era. In the 19th century, public concerts provided access to classical music to all classes of society. Yet, for political and financial reasons Ireland has been too small to provide a living to many musicians, so the names of the better-known [[List of Irish classical composers|Irish composers]] of this time belong to emigrants.

Irish [[folk music|traditional music]] and [[dance]] has seen a surge in popularity and global coverage since the 1960s. In the middle years of the 20th century, as Irish society was modernising, traditional music had fallen out of favour, especially in urban areas.<ref>{{Cite book |last=Geraghty |first=Des |title=Luke Kelly: A Memoir |publisher=Basement Press |date=1994 |pages=26–30 |isbn=978-1-85594-090-1}}</ref> However during the 1960s, there was a revival of interest in Irish traditional music led by groups such as [[The Dubliners]], [[The Chieftains]], [[The Wolfe Tones]], the [[Clancy Brothers]], [[Sweeney's Men]] and individuals like {{lang|ga|[[Seán Ó Riada]]}} and [[Christy Moore]]. Groups and musicians including [[Horslips]], [[Van Morrison]] and [[Thin Lizzy]] incorporated elements of Irish traditional music into contemporary [[rock music]] and, during the 1970s and 1980s, the distinction between traditional and rock musicians became blurred, with many individuals regularly crossing over between these styles of playing. This trend can be seen more recently in the work of artists like [[Enya]], [[The Saw Doctors]], [[The Corrs]], [[Sinéad O'Connor]], [[Clannad (musical group)|Clannad]], [[The Cranberries]] and [[The Pogues]] among others.

====Art====
The earliest known Irish graphic art and sculpture are Neolithic carvings found at sites such as [[Newgrange]]<ref>{{Cite book |last1=O'Kelly |first1=Michael J. |last2=O'Kelly |first2=Claire |title=Newgrange: Archaeology Art and Legend |publisher=Thames and Hudson |date=1982 |location=London |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=bGiMHQAACAAJ |isbn=978-0-500-27371-5}}</ref> and is traced through [[Bronze Age]] artefacts and the religious carvings and [[illuminated manuscripts]] of the medieval period. During the course of the 19th and 20th centuries, a strong tradition of painting emerged, including such figures as [[John Butler Yeats]], [[William Orpen]], [[Jack Yeats]] and [[Louis le Brocquy]]. Contemporary Irish visual artists of note include [[Sean Scully]], [[Kevin Abosch]], and [[Alice Maher]].

===Science===
[[File:Robert Boyle 0001.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Robert Boyle]] formulated Boyle's Law.]]
The Irish philosopher and theologian [[Johannes Scotus Eriugena]] was considered one of the leading intellectuals of the early Middle Ages. Sir [[Ernest Henry Shackleton]], an Irish explorer, was one of the principal figures of Antarctic exploration. He, along with his expedition, made the first ascent of [[Mount Erebus]] and the discovery of the approximate location of the [[South Magnetic Pole]]. [[Robert Boyle]] was a 17th-century natural philosopher, chemist, physicist, inventor and early [[gentleman scientist]]. He is largely regarded as one of the founders of modern chemistry and is best known for the formulation of [[Boyle's law]].<ref name="ucc boyle boi">{{cite web |last=Reville |first=William |title=Ireland's Scientific Heritage |website=Understanding Science: Famous Irish Scientists |publisher=[[University College Cork]], Faculty of Science |date=14 December 2000 |url= http://undersci.ucc.ie/wp-content/uploads/sites/12/2014/11/Robert_Boyle.pdf |access-date=30 August 2015}}</ref>

19th-century physicist, [[John Tyndall]], discovered the [[Tyndall effect]]. [[Father Nicholas Joseph Callan]], Professor of Natural Philosophy in [[Maynooth College]], is best known for his invention of the [[induction coil]], [[transformer]] and he discovered an early method of [[galvanisation]] in the 19th century.

Other notable Irish [[physicists]] include [[Ernest Walton]], winner of the 1951 [[Nobel Prize in Physics]].

[[Gaelic football]] is the most popular sport in Ireland in terms of match attendance and community involvement, with about 2,600 clubs on the island. In 2003 it represented 34% of total sports attendances at events in Ireland and abroad, followed by [[hurling]] at 23%, soccer at 16% and [[rugby football|rugby]] at 8%.<ref name="esri">{{cite web |url= http://www.esri.ie/pdf/BKMNINT180_Main%20Text_Social%20and%20Economic%20Value%20of%20Sport.pdf |publisher=Economic and Social Research Institute |title=The Social Significance of Sport |access-date=21 October 2008 |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20150712134834/http://www.esri.ie/pdf/BKMNINT180_Main%20Text_Social%20and%20Economic%20Value%20of%20Sport.pdf |archive-date=12 July 2015}}</ref> The [[All-Ireland Football Final]] is the most watched event in the sporting calendar.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.finfacts.com/irelandbusinessnews/publish/article_10004396.shtml |title=Initiative's latest ViewerTrack study shows that in Ireland GAA and soccer still dominate the sporting arena, while globally the Superbowl (sic) was the most watched sporting event of 2005 |website=FinFacts.com |publisher=Finfacts Multimedia |date=4 January 2006 |access-date=24 January 2010}}</ref> Soccer is the most widely played team game on the island and the most popular in Northern Ireland.<ref name="esri"/><ref name="FootballSoccer">{{cite web |url= http://www.culturenorthernireland.org/article/709/soccer-in-northern-ireland |title=Soccer in Northern Ireland |website=Culture Northern Ireland |publisher=Nerve Centre |location=Derry/Londonderry |date=14 July 2008 |access-date=8 June 2011}}</ref>

The island fields a single international team in most sports. One notable exception to this is association football, although both associations continued to field international teams under the name "Ireland" until the 1950s. The sport is also the most notable exception where the [[Republic of Ireland national football team|Republic of Ireland]] and [[Northern Ireland national football team|Northern Ireland]] field separate international teams. Northern Ireland has produced two World Snooker Champions.

====Field sports====
[[File:Tyrone Blanket Defence.jpg|thumb|[[Tyrone GAA|Tyrone]] v [[Kerry GAA|Kerry]] in the [[2005 All-Ireland Senior Football Championship Final]]]]
[[Gaelic football]], [[hurling]] and [[Gaelic handball|handball]] are the best-known of the Irish traditional sports, collectively known as [[Gaelic games]]. Gaelic games are governed by the [[Gaelic Athletic Association]] (GAA), with the exception of ladies' Gaelic football and camogie (women's variant of hurling), which are governed by separate organisations. The headquarters of the GAA (and the main stadium) is located at the 82,500<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.crokepark.ie/ |title=Croke Park. Not just a venue. A destination |publisher=Croke Park Stadium / Gaelic Athletic Association |access-date=3 October 2007}}</ref> capacity [[Croke Park]] in north Dublin. Many major GAA games are played there, including the semi-finals and finals of the [[All-Ireland Senior Football Championship]] and [[All-Ireland Senior Hurling Championship]]. During the redevelopment of the [[Lansdowne Road|Lansdowne Road stadium]] in 2007–2010, international rugby and soccer were played there.<ref>{{Cite news |url= https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/02/05/AR2007020501459.html |title=For First Time, Croke Park Is Ireland's Common Ground |date=6 February 2007 |access-date=14 August 2008 |work=The Washington Post |first=Michael |last=Moynihan}}</ref> All GAA players, even at the highest level, are amateurs, receiving no wages, although they are permitted to receive a limited amount of sport-related income from commercial sponsorship.

The [[Irish Football Association]] (IFA) was originally the governing body for soccer across the island. The game has been played in an organised fashion in Ireland since the 1870s, with [[Cliftonville F.C.]] in Belfast being Ireland's oldest club. It was most popular, especially in its first decades, around Belfast and in Ulster. However, some clubs based outside Belfast thought that the IFA largely favoured Ulster-based clubs in such matters as selection for the national team. In 1921, following an incident in which, despite an earlier promise, the IFA moved an [[Irish Cup]] semi-final replay from Dublin to Belfast,<ref>{{cite web |title=FAI History: 1921–1930 |publisher=Football Association of Ireland |date=5 June 2009 |url= http://www.fai.ie/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=222&Itemid=226 |access-date=30 December 2009}}</ref> Dublin-based clubs broke away to form the Football Association of the Irish Free State. Today the southern association is known as the [[Football Association of Ireland]] (FAI). Despite being initially blacklisted by the [[Home Nations]]' associations, the FAI was recognised by [[FIFA]] in 1923 and organised its first international fixture in 1926 (against [[Italy national football team|Italy]]). However, both the IFA and FAI continued to select their teams from the whole of Ireland, with some players earning international caps for matches with both teams. Both also referred to their respective teams as ''Ireland''.

[[File:Paul O'Connell Ireland Rugby.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Paul O'Connell]] reaching for the ball during a [[Line-out (rugby union)|line out]] against [[Argentina national rugby union team|Argentina]] in 2007.]]
In 1950, FIFA directed the associations only to select players from within their respective territories and, in 1953, directed that the FAI's team be known only as "[[Republic of Ireland national football team|Republic of Ireland]]" and that the IFA's team be known as "[[Northern Ireland national football team|Northern Ireland]]" (with certain exceptions). Northern Ireland qualified for the [[FIFA World Cup|World Cup]] finals in [[1958 FIFA World Cup|1958]] (reaching the quarter-finals), [[1982 FIFA World Cup|1982]] and [[1986 FIFA World Cup|1986]] and the [[UEFA European Championship|European Championship]] in [[UEFA Euro 2016|2016]]. The Republic qualified for the World Cup finals in [[1990 FIFA World Cup|1990]] (reaching the quarter-finals), [[1994 FIFA World Cup|1994]], [[2002 FIFA World Cup|2002]] and the European Championship in [[UEFA Euro 1988|1988]], [[UEFA Euro 2012|2012]] and [[UEFA Euro 2016|2016]]. Across Ireland, there is significant interest in the [[Premier League|English]] and, to a lesser extent, [[Scottish Premier League|Scottish]] soccer leagues.

Ireland fields a single [[Ireland national rugby union team|national rugby team]] and a single association, the [[Irish Rugby Football Union]], governs the sport across the island. The Irish rugby team have played in every [[Rugby World Cup]], making the quarter-finals in six of them. Ireland also hosted games during the [[1991 Rugby World Cup|1991]] and the [[1999 Rugby World Cup]]s (including a quarter-final). There are four professional Irish teams; all four play in the [[Pro14]] and at least three compete for the [[Heineken Cup]]. Irish rugby has become increasingly competitive at both the international and provincial levels since the sport went professional in 1994. During that time, [[Ulster Rugby|Ulster]] ([[1998–99 Heineken Cup|1999]]),<ref name="heineken champions archive">{{cite web |url=http://archive.ercrugby.com/heinekencup/champions.php |title=Champions of Europe |publisher=European Club Rugby |website=ERCRugby.com |date=2014 |access-date=4 October 2014 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141006080223/http://archive.ercrugby.com/heinekencup/champions.php |archive-date=6 October 2014  }}</ref> [[Munster Rugby|Munster]] ([[2005–06 Heineken Cup|2006]]<ref>{{Cite news |url= http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/rugby_union/european/4998452.stm |title=Munster 23–19 Biarritz |work=BBC News Online |date=20 May 2006 |access-date=13 October 2011}}</ref> and [[2007–08 Heineken Cup|2008]])<ref name="heineken champions archive"/> and [[Leinster Rugby|Leinster]] ([[2008–09 Heineken Cup|2009]], [[2010–11 Heineken Cup|2011]] and [[2011–12 Heineken Cup|2012]])<ref name="heineken champions archive"/> have won the Heineken Cup.

====Recreation====
The west coast of Ireland, [[Lahinch]] and [[Donegal Bay]] in particular, have popular surfing beaches, being fully exposed to the Atlantic Ocean. Donegal Bay is shaped like a funnel and catches west/south-west Atlantic winds, creating good surf, especially in winter. Since just before the year 2010, [[Bundoran]] has hosted European championship surfing. [[Scuba diving]] is increasingly popular in Ireland with clear waters and large populations of sea life, particularly along the western seaboard. There are also many shipwrecks along the coast of Ireland, with some of the best [[wreck dives]] being in [[Malin Head]] and off the [[County Cork]] coast.<ref>{{cite news |last=McDaid |first=Brendan |url= http://www.belfasttelegraph.co.uk/imported/shipwrecks-ahoy-in-area-28256564.html |title=Shipwrecks ahoy in area |work=Belfast Telegraph |date=9 June 2004 |access-date=27 March 2010}}</ref>

With thousands of lakes, over {{convert|14000|km|mi|-2}} of fish-bearing rivers and over {{convert|3700|km|mi|-1}} of coastline, Ireland is a popular [[angling]] destination. The temperate Irish climate is suited to sport angling. While [[salmon]] and [[trout]] fishing remain popular with anglers, salmon fishing in particular received a boost in 2006 with the closing of the salmon [[driftnet]] fishery. [[Coarse fishing]] continues to increase its profile. Sea angling is developed with many beaches mapped and signposted,<ref>{{cite web |title=Fishing in Ireland |publisher=Central and Regional Fisheries Boards |url= http://www.fishinginireland.info |access-date=26 March 2010}}</ref> and the range of sea angling species is around 80.<ref>{{cite web |title=Sea Fishing in Ireland |publisher=Central and Regional Fisheries Boards |url= http://www.fishinginireland.info/sea |access-date=26 March 2010}}</ref>

===Food and drink===
{{main|Irish cuisine}}
[[File:Cheese 61 bg 080106.jpg|thumb|[[Gubbeen cheese]], an example of the resurgence in Irish cheese making]]
Food and cuisine in Ireland takes its influence from the crops grown and animals farmed in the island's temperate climate and from the social and political circumstances of Irish history. For example, whilst from the Middle Ages until the arrival of the potato in the 16th century the dominant feature of the Irish economy was the herding of cattle, the number of cattle a person owned was equated to their social standing.<ref name="food_companion" >{{cite book |first1=Alan |last1=Davidson |first2=Tom |last2=Jaine |title=The Oxford Companion to Food |publisher=Oxford University Press |date=2006 |pages=407–408 |isbn=978-0-19-280681-9}}</ref> Thus herders would avoid slaughtering a milk-producing cow.<ref name="food_companion" />

For this reason, pork and [[white meat]] were more common than beef, and thick fatty strips of salted [[bacon]] (known as rashers) and the eating of salted butter (i.e. a dairy product rather than beef itself) have been a central feature of the diet in Ireland since the Middle Ages.<ref name="food_companion" /> The practice of bleeding cattle and mixing the blood with milk and butter (not unlike the practice of the [[Maasai people|Maasai]]) was common<ref>{{cite journal |title=The History and Social Influence of the Potato |first1=Redcliffe Nathan |last1=Salaman |first2=William Glynn |last2=Burton |first3=John Gregory |last3=Hawkes |publisher=Cambridge University Press |date=1985 |pages=218–219}}</ref> and [[black pudding]], made from blood, grain (usually barley) and seasoning, remains a breakfast staple in Ireland. All of these influences can be seen today in the phenomenon of the "[[breakfast roll]]".

[[Effects of climate change on island nations|Like other island nations]], Antigua and Barbuda are particularly vulnerable to the [[effects of climate change]], such as [[sea level rise]],  and [[Extreme weather|increased intensity of extreme weather]] like hurricanes, which have direct impacts on the island through coastal erosion, [[water scarcity]], and other challenges.<ref>{{Cite web|title=World Bank Climate Change Knowledge Portal:Antique and Barbuda |url=https://climateknowledgeportal.worldbank.org/country/antigua-and-barbuda|access-date=2020-11-25|website=climateknowledgeportal.worldbank.org|language=en}}</ref>

== Etymology ==
''{{lang|es|Antigua}}'' is Spanish for "ancient" and ''{{lang|es|barbuda}}'' is Spanish for "bearded".<ref name=Factbook /> The island of Antigua was originally called ''{{lang|tnq|Wadadli}}'' by [[Arawak]]s and is locally known by that name today; [[Island Caribs|Caribs]] possibly called Barbuda ''{{lang|crb|Wa'omoni}}''. [[Christopher Columbus]], while sailing by in 1493 may have named it Santa Maria la Antigua, after an icon in the Spanish [[Seville Cathedral]]. The "bearded" of Barbuda is thought to refer either to the male inhabitants of the island, or the bearded fig trees present there.

===European arrival and settlement===
[[Christopher Columbus]] was the first European to sight the islands in 1493.<ref name=Britannica /><ref name=Commonwealth /> The Spanish did not colonise Antigua until after a combination of European and African diseases, malnutrition, and slavery eventually extirpated most of the native population; [[smallpox]] was probably the greatest killer.<ref>{{cite book| last = Austin Alchon| first = Suzanne| title = A pest in the land: new world epidemics in a global perspective| url = https://books.google.com/books?id=YiHHnV08ebkC&pg=PA62| year = 2003| publisher = University of New Mexico Press| isbn = 0-8263-2871-7| pages = 62–63 }}

The English settled on Antigua in 1632;<ref name=Commonwealth /><ref name=Britannica /> Christopher Codrington settled on Barbuda in 1685.<ref name=Commonwealth /><ref name=Britannica /> Tobacco and then sugar was grown, worked by a large population of slaves from West Africa who soon came to vastly outnumber the European settlers.<ref name=Britannica />

===Colonial era===
The English maintained control of the islands, repulsing an attempted French attack in 1666.<ref name=Britannica /> The brutal conditions endured by the slaves led to revolts in 1701 and 1729 and a planned revolt in 1736, the latter led by [[Prince Klaas]], though it was discovered before it began and the ringleaders were executed.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.smithsonianmag.com/history/antiguas-disputed-slave-conspiracy-of-1736-117569/ |title=Antigua's Disputed Slave Conspiracy of 1736 |access-date= 8 July 2019}}</ref> [[Slavery]] was abolished in the British Empire in 1833, affecting the economy.<ref name=Commonwealth /><ref name=Britannica /> This was exacerbated by natural disasters such as the 1843 earthquake and the 1847 hurricane.<ref name=Britannica /> Mining occurred on the isle of [[Redonda]], however this ceased in 1929 and the island has since remained uninhabited.<ref name="kras-2008">{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=TnItHSAgevMC&pg=PA18|title=The History of Redonda|page=18|work=Antigua and Barbuda|first=Sara Louise|last=Kras|publisher=Marshall Cavendish|year=2008|isbn=9780761425700|series=Cultures of the World|volume=26|quote=a cableway using baskets was built to transfer the mined phosphate to a pier for shipping}}</ref>

Part of the Leeward Islands colony, Antigua and Barbuda became part of the short-lived [[West Indies Federation]] from 1958 to 1962.<ref name=Commonwealth /><ref name=Britannica /> Antigua and Barbuda subsequently became an associated state of the United Kingdom with full internal autonomy on 27 February 1967.<ref name=Britannica /> The 1970s were dominated by discussions as to the islands' future and the rivalry between [[Vere Bird]] of the [[Antigua Labour Party]] (ALP) (Premier from 1967 to 1971 and 1976 to 1981) and the [[Progressive Labour Movement]] (PLM) of [[George Walter]] (Premier 1971–1976). Eventually Antigua and Barbuda gained full independence on 1 November 1981; Vere Bird became Prime Minister of the new country.<ref name=Britannica /> The country opted to remain within the [[Commonwealth of Nations|Commonwealth]], retaining Queen Elizabeth as [[Monarchy of Antigua and Barbuda|head of state]], with the last [[List of colonial governors and administrators of Antigua#Governors of Antigua and Barbuda (1967–1981)|Governor]], [[Wilfred Jacobs|Sir Wilfred Jacobs]], as [[Governor-General of Antigua and Barbuda|Governor-General]].

The first two decades of Antigua's independence were dominated politically by the Bird family and the ALP, with Vere Bird ruling from 1981 to 1994, followed by his son [[Lester Bird]] from 1994 to 2004.<ref name=Britannica /> Though providing a degree of political stability, and boosting tourism to the country, the Bird governments were frequently accused of corruption, cronyism and financial malfeasance.<ref name=Commonwealth /><ref name=Britannica /> [[Vere Bird Jr.]], the elder son, was forced to leave the cabinet in 1990 following a [[Guns for Antigua|scandal]] in which he was accused of smuggling Israeli weapons to Colombian drug-traffickers.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=bAsgAAAAIBAJ&pg=1313,5601929&dq=vere+bird+jr&hl=en|title=Antiguan Quits in Weapons Scandal|date=26 April 1990|work=Sun-Journal|access-date=4 July 2011}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|title=Antigua-Barbuda: Government Finally Orders Probe of Arms Shipment|date=25 April 1990|work=IPS-Inter Press Service}}</ref><ref name=Commonwealth /> Another son, [[Ivor Bird]], was convicted of selling [[cocaine]] in 1995.<ref>{{cite news|title=Younger Brother of Prime Minister Lester Bird Is Arrested on Cocaine Charges|last=Massiah|first=David|date=7 May 1995|work=Associated Press Worldstream|agency=Associated Press}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|title=Prime Minister Lester Bird Promises No Intervention in Brother's Arrest|last=Massiah|first=David|date=8 May 1995|work=Associated Press Worldstream|agency=Associated Press}}</ref>

Antigua and Barbuda both are generally low-lying islands whose terrain has been influenced more by [[limestone]] formations than [[Volcanism|volcanic activity]]. The highest point on Antigua and Barbuda is [[Boggy Peak]], located in southwestern Antigua, which is the remnant of a [[volcanic]] crater rising {{convert|402|m|abbr=off}}.<ref name=Factbook /><ref name=Britannica />

The shorelines of both islands are greatly indented with beaches, lagoons, and natural harbors. The islands are rimmed by reefs and shoals. There are few streams as rainfall is slight. Both islands lack adequate amounts of fresh groundwater.<ref name=Factbook />

About {{convert|25|mi|km|order=flip|abbr=on}} south-west of Antigua lies the small, rocky island of [[Redonda]], which is uninhabited.<ref name=Britannica />

=== Cities and villages ===
{{Further|List of cities in Antigua and Barbuda}}
The most populous cities in Antigua and Barbuda are mostly on Antigua, being [[Saint John's, Antigua and Barbuda|Saint John's]], [[All Saints, Antigua and Barbuda|All Saints]], [[Piggotts]], and [[Liberta, Antigua and Barbuda|Liberta]].<ref>{{cite web |title=Largest cities in Antigua and Barbuda |url=https://population.mongabay.com/population/antigua-and-barbuda/ |website=Mongabay |access-date=3 February 2021}}</ref> The most populous city on Barbuda is [[Codrington, Antigua and Barbuda|Codrington]].

===Islands===
{{Further|Geography of Antigua and Barbuda#Islands}}
Antigua and Barbuda is comprised mostly of its two namesake islands, [[Antigua]], and [[Barbuda]], other than that, Antigua and Barbuda's biggest islands are Guiana Island & Long Island off the coast of Antigua, and [[Redonda]] island, which is far from both of the main islands.

=== Climate ===
Rainfall averages {{convert|990|mm|in|0|abbr=on}} per year, with the amount varying widely from season to season. In general the wettest period is between September and November. The islands generally experience low humidity and recurrent droughts. Temperatures average {{convert|27|°C|1}}, with a range from {{convert|23|°C|1}} to {{convert|29|°C|1}} in the winter to from {{convert|25|°C|1}} to {{convert|30|°C|1}} in the summer and autumn. The coolest period is between December and February.

[[Hurricane]]s strike on an average of once a year, including the powerful [[Saffir–Simpson scale#Category 5|Category 5]] [[Hurricane Irma]], on 6 September 2017, which damaged 95% of the structures on Barbuda.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.cnn.com/2017/09/06/us/hurricane-irma-puerto-rico-florida/index.html |title=Hurricane Irma: Powerful storm blamed for three deaths |first1=Jason |last1=Hanna |first2=Joe |last2=Sterling|first3=Steve |last3=Almasy |work=ABS TV Radio Antigua & Barbuda |publisher=[[CNN]] |date=6 September 2017 |access-date=6 September 2017}}</ref> Some 1,800 people were evacuated to Antigua.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.latimes.com/nation/la-na-irma-islands-20170909-story.html|title=Hurricane Irma leaves Caribbean islands devastated|first=Javier|last=Panzar|date=9 September 2017|work=Los Angeles Times}}</ref>

An estimate published by ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' indicated that over $100&nbsp;million would be required to rebuild homes and infrastructure. Philmore Mullin, Director of Barbuda's National Office of Disaster Services, said that "all critical infrastructure and utilities are non-existent – food supply, medicine, shelter, electricity, water, communications, waste management". He summarised the situation as follows: "Public utilities need to be rebuilt in their entirety... It is optimistic to think anything can be rebuilt in six months ... In my 25 years in disaster management, I have never seen something like this."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://time.com/4935433/hurricane-irma-barbuda-antigua-survivors-caribbean/|title='There Is No Home to Go Back to.'

==Demographics==
{{Main|Demographics of Antigua and Barbuda}}
[[File:Antigua-Barbuda-demography.png|thumb|450px|Antigua & Barbuda's population (1961–2010). Number of inhabitants in thousands.]]

===Ethnic groups===
Antigua has a population of {{UN_Population|Antigua and Barbuda}},{{UN_Population|ref}} mostly made up of people of [[West African]], British, and [[Portuguese people|Madeiran]] descent. The ethnic distribution consists of 91% Black & Mulatto, 4.4% mixed race, 1.7% White, and 2.9% other (primarily [[South Asians|East Indian]] and other Asian). Most Whites are of British descent. Christian Levantine Arabs, and a small number of [[Asians]] and [[Sephardic Jews]] make up the remainder of the population.

An increasingly large percentage of the population lives abroad, most notably in the United Kingdom ([[Antiguan British|Antiguan Britons]]), United States and Canada. A minority of Antiguan residents are immigrants from other countries, particularly from Dominica, Guyana and [[Jamaica]], and, increasingly, from the Dominican Republic, [[St. Vincent and the Grenadines]] and [[Nigeria]]. An estimated 4,500 American citizens also make their home in Antigua and Barbuda, making their numbers one of the largest American populations in the English-speaking Eastern Caribbean.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://2009-2017.state.gov/r/pa/ei/bgn/2336.htm |title=Background Note: Antigua and Barbuda |access-date=23 August 2007}}</ref>

===Languages===
English is the official language. The [[Barbuda]]n accent is slightly different from the [[Antigua]]n.

In the years before Antigua and Barbuda's independence, Standard English was widely spoken in preference to Antiguan Creole. Generally, the upper and middle classes shun Antiguan Creole. The educational system dissuades the use of Antiguan Creole and instruction is done in Standard (British) English.

Many of the words used in the Antiguan dialect are derived from [[British English|British]] as well as African languages. This can be easily seen in phrases such as: "Ent it?" meaning "Ain't it?" which is itself dialectal and means "Isn't it?". Common island [[proverb]]s can often be traced to Africa.

Spanish is spoken by around 10,000 inhabitants.<ref>Farquhar, Bernadette, [http://www.cavehill.uwi.edu/BNCCde/antigua/conference/papers/farquhar.html "The Spanish Language in Antigua and Barbuda: Implications for Language Planning and Language Research"] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130715015910/http://www.cavehill.uwi.edu/BNCCde/antigua/conference/papers/farquhar.html |date=15 July 2013 }}</ref>

===Religion===
[[File:Stjohnscathedralantigua.jpg|thumb|[[St. John's Cathedral, St. John's]]]]

A majority (77%)<ref name=Factbook /> of Antiguans are Christians, with the [[Anglicans]] (17.6%) being the largest single denomination. Other Christian denominations present are [[Seventh-day Adventist Church]] (12.4%), [[Pentecostalism]] (12.2%), [[Moravian Church]] (8.3%), [[Roman Catholics]]
(8.2%), [[Methodist Church]] (5.6%), [[Wesleyan Holiness Church]] (4.5%), [[Church of God (Cleveland, Tennessee)|Church of God]] (4.1%), [[Baptists]] (3.6%), [[Mormonism]] (<1.0%), as well as [[Jehovah's Witnesses]].

Non-Christian religions practiced in the islands include the [[Rastafari]], [[Islam]], and [[Baháʼí Faith]].{{citation needed|date=July 2019}}

==Governance==

===Political system===
{{Main|Politics of Antigua and Barbuda}}

[[File:St Johns Antigua 2012.jpg|thumb|St. John's on Antigua.]]
The politics of Antigua and Barbuda take place within a framework of a [[Unitary state|unitary]], [[parliamentary system|parliamentary]], [[representative democracy|representative democratic]] monarchy, in which the [[head of State]] is the monarch who appoints the [[List of Governors-General of Antigua and Barbuda|Governor-General]] as vice-regal representative.<ref>{{cite web|title=Antigua and Barbuda 1981|url=https://www.constituteproject.org/constitution/Antigua_and_Barbuda_1981?lang=en|website=Constitute|access-date=20 February 2015}}</ref> [[Elizabeth II]] is the present [[Queen of Antigua and Barbuda]], having served in that position since the islands' independence from the [[United Kingdom]] in 1981. The Queen is currently represented by Governor-General [[Rodney Williams (politician)|Sir Rodney Williams]]. A council of ministers is appointed by the governor general on the advice of the [[List of Prime Ministers of Antigua and Barbuda|prime minister]], currently [[Gaston Browne]] (2014–). The prime minister is the [[head of government]].

[[Executive power]] is exercised by the government while [[legislative power]] is vested in both the [[Forms of government|government]] and the two Chambers of [[Parliament of Antigua and Barbuda|Parliament]]. The [[bicameral]] Parliament consists of the Senate (17 members appointed by members of the government and the [[Official Opposition|opposition]] party, and approved by the Governor-General), and the House of Representatives (17 members elected by [[first past the post]]) to serve five-year terms.

The current Leader of Her Majesty's Loyal Opposition is the United Progressive Party Member of Parliament (MP), the Honourable [[Baldwin Spencer]].

===Elections===
[[File:Antigua.St.John.from west.wmt.jpg|thumb|St. John's parish on Antigua.]]

The last elections held were on 12 June 2014, during which the [[Antigua Labour Party]] won 14 seats, and the [[United Progressive Party (Antigua and Barbuda)|United Progressive Party]] 3 seats.

Since 1949, elections have been won by the [[populism|populist]] Antigua Labour Party. However, in the [[Antigua and Barbuda general election, 2004|Antigua and Barbuda legislative election of 2004]] saw the defeat of the longest-serving elected government in the Caribbean. Prime Minister [[Lester Bird|Lester Bryant Bird]], who had succeeded his father Vere Cornwall Bird Sr., and Deputy Robin Yearwood had been in office since 1976.

The elder Bird was Prime Minister from 1981 to 1994 and Chief Minister of Antigua from 1960 to 1981, except for the 1971–1976 period when the Progressive Labour Movement (PLM) defeated his party. Vere Cornwall Bird, the nation's first Prime Minister, is credited with having brought Antigua and Barbuda and the Caribbean into a new era of independence.

====Party elections====
[[Gaston Browne]] defeated his predecessor [[Lester Bryant Bird]] at the Antigua Labour Party's biennial convention in November 2012 held to elect a political leader and other officers. The party then altered its name from the [[Antigua Labour Party]] (ALP) to the Antigua and Barbuda Labour Party (ABLP). This was done to officially include the party's presence on the sister island of Barbuda in its organisation, the only political party on the mainland to have a physical branch in Barbuda.

=== Judiciary ===
The Judicial branch is the [[Eastern Caribbean Supreme Court]] (based in Saint Lucia; one judge of the Supreme Court is a resident of the islands and presides over the High Court of Justice). Antigua is also a member of the [[Caribbean Court of Justice]]. The [[Judicial Committee of the Privy Council]] serves as its Supreme Court of Appeal.<ref>{{cite web|title=Caribbean Court of Justice|url=http://www.ijrcenter.org/regional-communities/caribbean-court-of-justice/|website=International Justice Resource Center|date=5 September 2012}}</ref>

===Foreign relations===
{{Main|Foreign relations of Antigua and Barbuda}}

Antigua and Barbuda is a member of the United Nations, the [[Bolivarian Alliance for the Americas]], the [[Commonwealth of Nations]], the [[Caribbean Community]], the [[Organization of Eastern Caribbean States]], the [[Organization of American States]], the [[World Trade Organization]] and the Eastern Caribbean's Regional Security System.

Antigua and Barbuda is also a member of the [[International Criminal Court]] (with a [[Bilateral Immunity Agreement]] of Protection for the US military as covered under Article 98 of the [[Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court|Rome Statute]]).

In 2013, Antigua and Barbuda called for [[reparations for slavery]] at the United Nations. Prime Minister [[Baldwin Spencer]] said "We have recently seen a number of leaders apologising", and that they should now "match their words with concrete and material benefits."<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.economist.com/news/americas/21587236-pressure-grows-compensation-caribbean-trade-blood-money |title=Slavery reparations: Blood money |newspaper=[[The Economist]] |date=5 October 2013}}</ref>

===Military===
{{Further|Royal Antigua and Barbuda Defence Force}}

The [[Royal Antigua and Barbuda Defence Force]] has around 260 members dispersed between the line infantry regiment, service and support unit and coast guard. There is also the Antigua and Barbuda Cadet Corps made up of 200 teenagers between the ages of 12 to 18.

In 2018, Antigua and Barbuda signed the UN [[treaty on the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons]].<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://treaties.un.org/Pages/ViewDetails.aspx?src=TREATY&mtdsg_no=XXVI-9&chapter=26&clang=_en |title=Chapter XXVI: Disarmament&nbsp;– No. 9 Treaty on the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons |publisher=United Nations Treaty Collection |date=7 July 2017}}</ref>

===Administrative divisions===
{{Main|Parishes and dependencies of Antigua and Barbuda}}

Antigua and Barbuda is divided into six parishes and two dependencies:

Note: Though Barbuda and Redonda are called dependencies they are integral parts of the state, making them essentially administrative divisions. Dependency is simply a title.

===Human rights===
Antigua and Barbuda does not allow discrimination in employment, child labor, [[Human trafficking]], there are laws against [[Domestic abuse]] and [[Child abuse]].<ref>{{cite book |title=Antigua and Barbuda 2018 Human Rights Report |date=2018 |publisher=United States Department of State |pages=1-13 |url=https://www.state.gov/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/ANTIGUA-AND-BARBUDA-2018.pdf}}</ref>  Although it has not been enforced or a case brought to trial in many years, like other Caribbean islands, [[LGBT rights in Antigua and Barbuda|Same-sex sexual activity]] is illegal in Antigua and Barbuda and punishable by prison time, though not enforced.

==Economy==
{{Main|Economy of Antigua and Barbuda}}
[[File:Tree map export 2009 Antigua and Barbuda.jpeg|thumb|350px|A proportional representation of Antigua and Barbuda's exports.]]
Tourism dominates the economy, accounting for more than half of the gross domestic product (GDP).<ref name=Factbook /><ref name=Britannica /> Antigua is famous for its many luxury resorts as an ultra-high end travel destination. Weakened tourist activity in the lower and middle market segments since early 2000 has slowed the economy, however, and squeezed the government into a tight fiscal corner.<ref name=Factbook />

Investment banking and financial services also make up an important part of the economy. Major world banks with offices in Antigua include the Royal Bank of Canada (RBC) and Scotiabank. Financial-services corporations with offices in Antigua include PriceWaterhouseCoopers. The [[US Securities and Exchange Commission]] has accused the Antigua-based [[Stanford International Bank]], owned by Texas billionaire [[Allen Stanford]], of orchestrating a huge fraud which may have bilked investors of some $8&nbsp;billion.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/02/21/business/21stanford.html |work=The New York Times |title=Fraud Case Shakes a Billionaire's Caribbean Realm |first1=Clifford |last1=Krauss |first2=Julie |last2=Creswell |first3=Charlie |last3=Savage |date=21 February 2009 |access-date=14 April 2010}}</ref>

The twin-island nation's agricultural production is focused on its domestic market and constrained by a limited [[water supply]] and a [[labor (economics)|labour]] shortage stemming from the lure of higher wages in tourism and construction work.{{citation needed|date=August 2019}}

Manufacturing is made up of enclave-type assembly for export, the major products being bedding, handicrafts and electronic components. Prospects for economic growth in the medium term will continue to depend on income growth in the industrialised world, especially in the United States, from which about one-third of all tourists come.{{citation needed|date=August 2019}}

Access to [[biocapacity]] is lower than world average. In 2016, Antigua and Barbuda had 0.8 global hectares<ref name=footprintdata>{{cite web|url=http://data.footprintnetwork.org/#/countryTrends?cn=8&type=BCpc,EFCpc|title=Country Trends|publisher=Global Footprint Network|access-date= 4 June 2020}}</ref> of biocapacity per person within its territory, much less than the world average of 1.6 global hectares per person.<ref>{{Cite journal|last1=Lin|first1=David|last2=Hanscom|first2=Laurel|last3=Murthy|first3=Adeline|last4=Galli|first4=Alessandro|last5=Evans|first5=Mikel|last6=Neill|first6=Evan|last7=Mancini|first7=MariaSerena|last8=Martindill|first8=Jon|last9=Medouar|first9=FatimeZahra|last10=Huang|first10=Shiyu|last11=Wackernagel

Following the opening of the American University of Antigua College of Medicine by investor and attorney Neil Simon in 2003, a new source of revenue was established. The university employs many local Antiguans and the approximate 1000 students consume a large amount of the goods and services.{{citation needed|date=August 2019}}

Antigua and Barbuda also uses an [[economic citizenship]] program to spur investment into the country.<ref name="CIU">{{cite web |url=https://www.cip.gov.ag |title=Antigua and Barbuda Citizenship by Investment Program |author=Citizenship by Investment Unit |publisher=Antigua and Barbuda |access-date=2 November 2019 }}</ref>

==Education==
{{Main|Education in Antigua and Barbuda}}
Antigua and Barbuda has a greater than 90% literacy rate. In 1998, Antigua and Barbuda adopted a national mandate to become the pre-eminent provider of medical services in the Caribbean. As part of this mission, Antigua and Barbuda built the most technologically advanced hospital in the Caribbean, the Mt. St. John Medical Centre. The island of Antigua currently has three foreign-owned [[for-profit education|for-profit]] [[offshore medical school]]. The island's medical schools cater mostly to foreign students but contribute to the local economy and health care. The three schools are:
* The [[American University of Antigua, College of Medicine|American University of Antigua]] (AUA),<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.auamed.org/ |title=American University of Antigua, College of Medicine |access-date=23 August 2007 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070822140939/http://www.auamed.org/ |archive-date=22 August 2007 |url-status=live }}</ref> founded in 2004
* The [[University of Health Sciences Antigua]] (UHSA),<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.uhsa.ag/ |title=University of Health Sciences Antigua |access-date=23 August 2007}}</ref> founded in 1982
* The Metropolitan University College of Medicine.

There is also the government-run [[Antigua State College]] as well as the Antigua and Barbuda Institute of Information Technology (ABIIT) and the Antigua and Barbuda Hospitality Training Institute (ABHTI). In 2019, the [[University of the West Indies]] opened its fifth campus overall (and fourth physical campus) in [[University of the West Indies at Five Islands|Five Islands]].<ref>{{cite web |title=UWI Five Islands officially accepts first students|url=http://www.loopjamaica.com/content/uwi-five-islands-officially-accepts-first-students |publisher=Jamaica News |access-date=17 December 2019}}</ref> The country was previously served solely by the [[University of the West Indies]] Open Campus.<ref>{{cite web |title=The Open Campus in Antigua & Barbuda |url=http://www.open.uwi.edu/antigua_barbuda |website=The Open Campus |publisher=The University of the West Indies |access-date=16 March 2019}}</ref>

Island Academy International, which offers the International Baccalaureate, is the only international school in the country. There are also many other private schools but these institutions tend to follow the same local curriculum (CXCs) as government schools.

==Culture==
{{See also|Music of Antigua and Barbuda}}

The culture is predominantly a mixture of West African and British cultural influences.

Cricket is the national sport. Other popular sports include football, boat racing and surfing. ([[Antigua Sailing Week]] attracts locals and visitors from all over the world).

[[Calypso music|Calypso]] and [[soca music]], both originating primarily out of [[Trinidad and Tobago]], are important in Antigua and Barbuda.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.geographia.com/antigua-barbuda/agcarn01.htm|title=Antigua & Barbuda – Carnival & Music|website=geographia.com|access-date=9 November 2016}}</ref>

===Festivals===
The national Carnival held each August commemorates the abolition of slavery in the [[British West Indies]], although on some islands, Carnival may celebrate the coming of Lent. Its festive pageants, shows, contests and other activities are a major tourist attraction.

===Cuisine===
{{Further|Antigua and Barbuda cuisine}}

Corn and sweet potatoes play an important role in Antiguan cuisine. For example, a popular Antiguan dish, Dukuna {{IPAc-en|ˈ|d|uː|k|uː|n|ɑː}} is a sweet, steamed dumpling made from grated sweet potatoes, flour and spices. One of the Antiguan staple foods, [[cou-cou|fungi]] {{IPAc-en|ˈ|f|uː|n|dʒ|iː}}, is a cooked paste made of cornmeal and water.

[[File:Cricket ground.jpg|thumb|The [[Antigua Recreation Ground]].]]
The [[Antigua and Barbuda national cricket team]] represented the country at the [[1998 Commonwealth Games]], but Antiguan cricketers otherwise play for the [[Leeward Islands cricket team]] in domestic matches and the [[West Indies cricket team]] internationally. The [[2007 Cricket World Cup]] was hosted in the West Indies from 11 March to 28 April 2007.

Antigua hosted eight matches at the [[Sir Vivian Richards Stadium]], which was completed on 11 February 2007 and can hold up to 20,000 people.
Antigua is a Host of [[Stanford Twenty20]] – [[Twenty20 Cricket]], a version started by [[Allen Stanford]] in 2006 as a regional cricket game with almost all Caribbean islands taking part. 
[[Rugby football|Rugby]] and [[netball]] are popular as well.

Association football, or soccer, is also a very popular sport. Antigua has a [[Antigua and Barbuda national football team|national football team]] which entered [[FIFA World Cup qualification|World Cup qualification]] for the 1974 tournament and for 1986 and onwards. A professional team was formed in 2011, [[Antigua Barracuda FC]], which played in the [[USL Pro]], a lower professional league in the USA. The nation's team had a major achievement in 2012, getting out of its preliminary group for the 2014 [[FIFA World Cup|World Cup]], notably due to a victory over powerful [[Haiti]]. In its first game in the next [[CONCACAF]] group play on 8 June 2012 in [[Tampa]], FL, Antigua and Barbuda, comprising 17 Barracuda players and 7 from the lower English professional leagues, scored a goal against the United States. However, the team lost 3:1 to the US.

'''Honduras''',{{efn|Spanish pronunciation: {{IPA-es|onˈduɾas||ES-pe - Honduras.ogg}}}} officially the '''Republic of Honduras''',{{efn|{{lang-es|República de Honduras}}}} is a country in [[Central America]]. The [[republic]] of Honduras is bordered to the west by [[Guatemala]], to the southwest by [[El Salvador]], to the southeast by [[Nicaragua]], to the south by the Pacific Ocean at the [[Gulf of Fonseca]], and to the north by the [[Gulf of Honduras]], a large inlet of the [[Caribbean Sea]].

Honduras was home to several important [[Mesoamerican]] cultures, most notably the [[Maya civilization|Maya]], before the [[Spanish colonization of the Americas|Spanish Colonization]] in the sixteenth century. The Spanish introduced Roman Catholicism and the now predominant [[Spanish language]], along with numerous customs that have blended with the indigenous culture. Honduras became independent in 1821 and has since been a republic, although it has consistently endured much social strife and political instability, and remains one of the poorest countries in the [[Western Hemisphere]]. In 1960, the northern part of what was the [[Mosquito Coast]] was transferred from Nicaragua to Honduras by the [[International Court of Justice]].<ref name="auto">{{cite news |title=Mosquito Coast |publisher=Britannica Concise Encyclopedia |url=http://concise.britannica.com/ebc/article-9372678/Mosquito-Coast |work=Encyclopædia Britannica |access-date=3 August 2007 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070929141401/http://concise.britannica.com/ebc/article-9372678/Mosquito-Coast |archive-date=29 September 2007 }}</ref>

The nation's economy is primarily agricultural, making it especially vulnerable to natural disasters such as [[Hurricane Mitch]] in 1998.<ref name=":9" /> The lower class is primarily agriculturally based while wealth is concentrated in the country's urban centers.<ref name="LOC" /> Honduras has a Human Development Index of 0.625, classifying it as a nation with medium development.<ref name=":1" /> When the Index is adjusted for income inequality, its Inequality-adjusted Human Development Index is 0.443.<ref name=":1" />

Honduran society is predominantly [[Mestizo]]; however, American Indian, black and white individuals also live in Honduras (2017).<ref name="cia.gov" /> The nation had a relatively high political stability until its [[2009 Honduran coup d'état|2009 coup]] and again with the [[2017 Honduran general election|2017 presidential election]].<ref name=":7">Ruhl, J.

Honduras spans about {{convert|112,492|km2|sqmi|abbr=on}} and has a population exceeding {{#expr:floor({{replace|{{UN_Population|Honduras}}|,||}}/1e6)}} million.{{UN_Population|ref}} Its northern portions are part of the [[western Caribbean zone]], as reflected in the area's demographics and culture. Honduras is known for its rich natural resources, including [[mineral]]s, [[coffee]], [[tropical fruit]], and [[sugar cane]], as well as for its growing [[textile]]s industry, which serves the international market.

==Etymology==<!--linked-->
The literal meaning of the term "Honduras" is "depths" in Spanish. The name could either refer to the bay of Trujillo as an anchorage, ''fondura'' in the [[Leonese dialect]] of Spain, or to [[Christopher Columbus|Columbus]]'s alleged quote that ''"Gracias a Dios que hemos salido de esas Honduras"'' ("Thank God we have departed from those depths").<ref name=timeline>{{cite web

It was not until the end of the 16th century that ''Honduras'' was used for the whole province.

Hondurans are often referred to as ''[[Catracho]]'' or ''Catracha'' (fem) in Spanish. The word was coined by [[Nicaraguans]] and derives from the last name of the Spanish Honduran General [[Florencio Xatruch]], who in 1857 led Honduran armed forces against an attempted invasion by North American adventurer [[William Walker (filibuster)|William Walker]]. The nickname is considered complimentary, not derogatory.

==History==
{{Main|History of Honduras}}
[[File:CPN ST B 01.jpg|thumb|A [[Maya stelae|Maya stela]], an emblematic symbol of the Honduran Mayan civilization at Copan|261x261px]]

===Pre-colonial period===
{{Further|Mesoamerican chronology}}
{{See also|Bajo Aguán}}
In the pre-Columbian era, modern Honduras was split between two pan-cultural regions: [[Mesoamerica]] in the west and the [[Isthmo-Colombian area]] in the east. Each complex had a "core area" within Honduras (the [[Sula Valley]] for Mesoamerica, and [[La Mosquitia (Honduras)|La Mosquitia]] for the Isthmo-Colombian area), and the intervening area was one of gradual transition. However, these concepts had no meaning in the Pre-Columbian era itself and represent extremely diverse areas. The [[Lenca|Lenca people]] of the interior highlands are also generally considered to be culturally Mesoamerican, though the extent of linkage with other areas varied over time (for example, expanding during the zenith of the [[Toltec Empire]]).

In the extreme west, [[Maya civilization]] flourished for hundreds of years. The dominant, best known, and best studied state within Honduras' borders was in [[Copán]], which was located in a mainly non-Maya area, or on the frontier between Maya and non-Maya areas. Copán declined with other Lowland centres during the conflagrations of the [[Classic Maya collapse|Terminal Classic]] in the 9th century. The Maya of this civilization survive in western Honduras as the [[Ch'orti' people|Ch'orti']], isolated from their Choltian linguistic peers to the west.<ref>

However, Copán represents only a fraction of Honduran pre-Columbian history. Remnants of other civilizations are found throughout the country. Archaeologists have studied sites such as {{illm|Naco (Honduras)|lt=Naco|es|Naco (Honduras)}} and La Sierra in the Naco Valley, [[Los Naranjos, Honduras|Los Naranjos]] on [[Lake Yojoa]], [[Yarumela]] in the Comayagua Valley,<ref>{{cite journal

In 2012, LiDAR scanning revealed that several previously unknown high density settlements existed in La Mosquitia, corresponding to the legend of "[[La Ciudad Blanca]]". Excavation and study has since improved knowledge of the region's history. It is estimated that these settlements reached their zenith from 500 to 1000 AD.

Much of the conquest took place in the following two decades, first by groups loyal to [[Cristóbal de Olid]], and then by those loyal to [[Francisco de Montejo]] but most particularly by those following Alvarado.{{who|date=December 2017}} In addition to Spanish resources, the conquerors relied heavily on armed forces from Mexico—[[Tlaxcalans]] and [[Aztec|Mexica]] armies of thousands who remained garrisoned in the region.

Resistance to conquest was led in particular by [[Lempira (Lenca ruler)|Lempira]]. Many regions in the north of Honduras never fell to the Spanish, notably the [[Mosquito Coast|Miskito Kingdom]]. After the Spanish conquest, Honduras became part of Spain's vast empire in the New World within the [[Captaincy General of Guatemala|Kingdom of Guatemala]]. Trujillo and [[Gracias a Dios Department|Gracias]] were the first city-capitals. The Spanish ruled the region for approximately three centuries.

===Spanish Honduras (1524–1821)===
Honduras was organized as a province of the [[Captaincy General of Guatemala|Kingdom of Guatemala]] and the capital was fixed, first at Trujillo on the Atlantic coast, and later at [[Comayagua]], and finally at [[Tegucigalpa]] in the central part of the country.

Although the Spanish conquered the southern or Pacific portion of Honduras fairly quickly, they were less successful on the northern, or Atlantic side. They managed to found a few towns along the coast, at [[Puerto Cortés|Puerto Caballos]] and Trujillo in particular, but failed to conquer the eastern portion of the region and many pockets of independent indigenous people as well. The [[Mosquito Coast|Miskito Kingdom]] in the northeast was particularly effective at resisting conquest. The Miskito Kingdom found support from northern European privateers, pirates and especially the British formerly English colony of [[Jamaica]], which placed much of the area under its protection after 1740.

===Independence (1821)===
Honduras gained independence from Spain in 1821 and was a part of the [[First Mexican Empire]] until 1823, when it became part of the [[United Provinces of Central America]]. It has been an independent republic and has held regular elections since 1838. In the 1840s and 1850s Honduras participated in several failed attempts at Central American unity, such as the Confederation of Central America (1842–1845), the covenant of Guatemala (1842), the Diet of Sonsonate (1846), the Diet of Nacaome (1847) and National Representation in Central America (1849–1852). Although Honduras eventually adopted the name Republic of Honduras, the unionist ideal never waned, and Honduras was one of the Central American countries that pushed the hardest for a policy of regional unity.

Policies favoring [[international trade]] and investment began in the 1870s, and soon foreign interests became involved, first in shipping from the north coast, especially tropical fruit and most notably bananas, and then in building railroads. In 1888, a projected railroad line from the Caribbean coast to the capital, [[Tegucigalpa]], ran out of money when it reached [[San Pedro Sula]]. As a result, San Pedro grew into the nation's primary industrial center and second-largest city. [[Comayagua]] was the capital of Honduras until 1880, when the capital moved to Tegucigalpa.

Since independence, nearly 300 small internal rebellions and civil wars have occurred in the country, including some changes of régime.{{citation needed|date=December 2017}}

===20th century and the role of American companies===
{{See also|Banana Wars}}
In the late nineteenth century, Honduras granted land and substantial exemptions to several US-based fruit and infrastructure companies in return for developing the country's northern regions. Thousands of workers came to the north coast as a result to work in [[Banana production in Honduras|banana plantations]] and other businesses that grew up around the export industry. Banana-exporting companies, dominated until 1930 by the [[Cuyamel Fruit Company]], as well as the [[United Fruit Company]], and [[Standard Fruit Company]], built an [[enclave economy]] in northern Honduras, controlling [[infrastructure]] and creating self-sufficient, tax-exempt sectors that contributed relatively little to economic growth. American troops landed in Honduras in 1903, 1907, 1911, 1912, 1919, 1924 and 1925.<ref name=Becker>

Honduras joined the [[Allies of World War II|Allied Nations]] after [[attack on Pearl Harbor|Pearl Harbor]], on 8 December 1941, and signed the [[Declaration by United Nations]] on 1 January 1942, along with twenty-five other governments.

Constitutional crises in the 1940s led to reforms in the 1950s. One reform gave workers permission to organize, and a 1954 [[General strike of 1954 (Honduras)|general strike]] paralyzed the northern part of the country for more than two months, but led to reforms. In 1963 a [[1963 Honduran coup d'état|military coup]] unseated democratically elected President [[Ramón Villeda Morales]].

In 1998, [[Hurricane Mitch]] caused massive and widespread destruction. Honduran President [[Carlos Roberto Flores]] said that fifty years of progress in the country had been reversed. Mitch destroyed about 70% of the country's crops and an estimated 70–80% of the transportation infrastructure, including nearly all bridges and secondary roads. Across Honduras 33,000 houses were destroyed, and an additional 50,000 damaged. Some 5,000 people killed, and 12,000 more injured. Total losses were estimated at US$3 billion.<ref>

==Geography==
{{Main|Geography of Honduras}}
[[File:Un-honduras.png|thumb|A map of Honduras]]

The north coast of Honduras borders the [[Caribbean Sea]] and the Pacific Ocean lies south through the [[Gulf of Fonseca]]. Honduras consists mainly of mountains, with narrow plains along the coasts. A large undeveloped lowland jungle, ''[[La Mosquitia (Honduras)|La Mosquitia]]'' lies in the northeast, and the heavily populated lowland Sula valley in the northwest. In La Mosquitia lies the [[UNESCO]] world-heritage site [[Río Plátano Biosphere Reserve]], with the [[Coco River]] which divides Honduras from [[Nicaragua]].

The [[Islas de la Bahía]] and the [[Swan Islands, Honduras|Swan Islands]] are off the north coast. [[Misteriosa Bank]] and [[Rosario Bank]], {{convert|130|to|150|km|abbr=off}} north of the Swan Islands, fall within the [[Exclusive Economic Zone]] (EEZ) of Honduras.
[[File:MontanasdelaSierradeAgalta Honduras.jpg|thumb|upright=1.35|Honduran rainforest]]
Natural resources include timber, gold, silver, copper, lead, [[zinc]], iron ore, [[antimony]], coal, fish, shrimp, and [[hydropower]].

=== Climate ===
[[File:Honduras Köppen.svg|upright=1.15|thumb|[[Köppen climate classification system|Köppen climate types]] of Honduras]]
The climate varies from tropical in the [[lowland]]s to [[temperate]] in the mountains. The central and southern regions are relatively hotter and less humid than the northern coast.

===Ecology===
{{main|Flora and Fauna of Honduras|section=TRUE}}
{{See also|List of birds of Honduras|Baja Aguán}}
The region is considered a [[biodiversity hotspot]] because of the many plant and animal species found there. Like other countries in the region, it contains vast biological resources. Honduras hosts more than 6,000 species of [[vascular plants]], of which 630 (described so far) are [[orchid]]s; around 250 [[reptile]]s and [[amphibian]]s, more than 700 bird species, and 110 [[mammal]]ian species, of which half are [[bat]]s.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.hondurassilvestre.com |title=Honduran Biodiversity Database |publisher=Honduras Silvestre |access-date=27 June 2010 |date=1 August 2012 |language=es}}</ref>

In the northeastern region of [[La Mosquitia (Honduras)|La Mosquitia]] lies the [[Río Plátano Biosphere Reserve]], a lowland rainforest which is home to a great diversity of life. The reserve was added to the [[UNESCO World Heritage]] Sites List in 1982.

Honduras has rain forests, [[cloud forests]] (which can rise up to nearly {{convert|3,000|m|disp=or|abbr=off}} [[above sea level]]), [[mangroves]], [[savannas]] and mountain ranges with pine and oak trees, and the [[Mesoamerican Barrier Reef System]]. In the [[Bay Islands (department)|Bay Islands]] there are [[bottlenose dolphins]], [[manta rays]], [[parrot fish]], schools of [[Acanthurus coeruleus|blue tang]] and [[whale shark]].

=== Environmental issues ===
[[Deforestation]] resulting from [[logging]] is rampant in [[Olancho Department]]. The clearing of land for agriculture is prevalent in the largely undeveloped [[La Mosquitia (Honduras)|La Mosquitia]] region, causing [[land degradation]] and [[soil erosion]]. Honduras had a 2019 [[Forest Landscape Integrity Index]] mean score of 4.48/10, ranking it 126<sup>th</sup> globally out of 172 countries.<ref name="FLII-Supplementary">{{cite journal|last1=Grantham|first1=H.

==Government and politics==
{{Main|Politics of Honduras}}

Honduras is governed within a framework of a [[presidential system|presidential]] [[representative democracy|representative democratic]] [[republic]]. The [[President of Honduras]] is both [[head of state]] and [[head of government]]. [[Executive power]] is exercised by the [[Politics of Honduras|Honduran government]]. [[Legislative power]] is vested in the [[National Congress of Honduras]]. The [[judiciary]] is independent of both the executive branch and the legislature.

The [[National Congress of Honduras]] (''Congreso Nacional'') has 128 members (''diputados''), elected for a four-year term by [[proportional representation]]. Congressional seats are assigned the parties' candidates on a [[Departments of Honduras|departmental basis]] in proportion to the number of votes each party receives.<ref name=cia>{{cite web|title=Honduras|url=https://www.cia.gov/the-world-factbook/countries/honduras/|work=[[The World Factbook]]|date=5 January 2016|access-date=9 February 2016}}</ref>

In 1963, a military coup removed the democratically elected president, [[Ramón Villeda Morales]]. A string of authoritarian [[Military junta|military governments]] held power uninterrupted until 1981, when [[Roberto Suazo Córdova]] was elected president.

The party system was dominated by the conservative [[National Party of Honduras]] (Partido Nacional de Honduras: PNH) and the liberal [[Liberal Party of Honduras]] (Partido Liberal de Honduras: PLH) until the [[2009 Honduran coup d'état]] removed [[Manuel Zelaya]] from office and put [[Roberto Micheletti]] in his place.

=== Foreign relations ===
{{Further|Foreign relations of Honduras}}

Honduras and [[Nicaragua]] had tense relations throughout 2000 and early 2001 due to a boundary dispute off the Atlantic coast. Nicaragua imposed a 35% [[tariff]] against Honduran goods due to the dispute.{{citation needed|date=December 2017}}

In June 2009 a [[coup d'état]] ousted President [[Manuel Zelaya]]; he was taken in a military aircraft to [[Costa Rica]]. The General Assembly of the United Nations voted to denounce the coup and called for the restoration of Zelaya. Several [[Latin America]]n nations, including Mexico, temporarily severed diplomatic relations with Honduras. In July 2010, full diplomatic relations were once again re-established with Mexico.<ref>{{cite web |url = http://mexico.cnn.com/nacional/2010/07/31/mexico-restablece-las-relaciones-diplomaticas-con-honduras |title = México restablece las relaciones diplomáticas con Honduras |trans-title = Mexico restores diplomatic relations with Honduras |language = es |date = 31 July 2010 |work = [[CNN]] |url-status = dead |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20150330235655/http://mexico.cnn.com/nacional/2010/07/31/mexico-restablece-las-relaciones-diplomaticas-con-honduras |archive-date = 30 March 2015 |df = dmy-all}}

This interest in regional agreements may have increased the alarm of establishment politicians. When Zelaya began calling for a "fourth ballot box" to determine whether Hondurans wished to convoke a special constitutional congress, this sounded a lot to some like the constitutional amendments that had extended the terms of both [[Hugo Chávez]] and [[Evo Morales]]. "Chávez has served as a role model for like-minded leaders intent on cementing their power.

Economic growth in the last few years has averaged 7% a year, one of the highest rates in Latin America (2010).<ref name=":0" /> Despite this, Honduras has seen the least development amongst all Central American countries.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://library.brown.edu/create/modernlatinamerica/chapters/chapter-16-latin-america-in-the-world-arena-1990s-present/honduras-a-country-and-a-coup/|title=Honduras: A Country and a Coup {{!}} Modern Latin America|website=library.brown.edu|language=en-US|access-date=26 November 2017}}</ref> Honduras is ranked 130 of 188 countries with a [[Human Development Index]] of .625 that classifies the nation as having medium development (2015).<ref name=":1">{{Cite web|url=http://hdr.undp.org/sites/all/themes/hdr_theme/country-notes/HND.pdf|title=Human Development Report 2016: Human Development for Everyone}}</ref> The three factors that go into Honduras' HDI (an extended and healthy life, accessibility of knowledge and standard of living) have all improved since 1990 but still remain relatively low with life expectancy at birth being 73.3, expected years of schooling being 11.2 (mean of 6.2 years) and [[GNP per capita|GNI per capita]] being $4,466 (2015).<ref name=":1" /> The HDI for Latin America and the Caribbean overall is 0.751 with life expectancy at birth being 68.6, expected years of schooling being 11.5 (mean of 6.6) and GNI per capita being $6,281 (2015).<ref name=":1" />

The [[2009 Honduran coup d'état]] led to a variety of economic trends in the nation.<ref name="elcorreo.eu.org" /> Overall growth has slowed, averaging 5.7 percent from 2006 to 2008 but slowing to 3.5 percent annually between 2010 and 2013.<ref name="elcorreo.eu.org" /> Following the coup trends of decreasing poverty and extreme poverty were reversed. The nation saw a poverty increase of 13.2 percent and in extreme poverty of 26.3 percent in just 3 years.<ref name="elcorreo.eu.org" /> Furthermore, unemployment grew between 2008 and 2012 from 6.8 percent to 14.1 percent.<ref name="elcorreo.eu.org" />

Because much of the Honduran economy is based on small scale agriculture of only a few exports, natural disasters have a particularly devastating impact. Natural disasters, such as [[Hurricane Mitch|1998 Hurricane Mitch]], have contributed to this inequality as they particularly affect poor rural areas.<ref name="worldbank.org">{{Cite news|url=http://www.worldbank.org/en/country/honduras/overview|title=Overview|work=World Bank|access-date=26 November 2017|language=en}}</ref> Additionally, they are a large contributor to food insecurity in the country as farmers are left unable to provide for their families.<ref name="worldbank.org" /> A study done by Honduras NGO, World Neighbors, determined the terms "increased workload, decreased basic grains, expensive food, and fear" were most associated with Hurricane Mitch.<ref>{{cite journal|jstor=24781641|first=Kathryn|last=Schaffer|title=Gender, Environment and Development in Honduras: An Applied Anthropology Internship|date=18 January 2018|journal=Practicing Anthropology|volume=22|issue=3|pages=25–26|doi=10.17730/praa.22.3.t76310161617758g}}</ref>

The rural and urban poor were hit hardest by Hurricane Mitch.<ref name="worldbank.org" /> Those in southern and western regions specifically were considered most vulnerable as they both were subject to environmental destruction and home to many subsistence farmers.<ref name="worldbank.org" /> Due to disasters such as Hurricane Mitch, the agricultural economic sector has declined a third in the past twenty years.<ref name="worldbank.org" /> This is mostly due to a decline in exports, such as bananas and coffee, that were affected by factors such as natural disasters.<ref name="worldbank.org" /> Indigenous communities along the Patuca River were hit extremely hard as well.<ref name=":9">McSweeney, Kendra, et al. "Climate-Related Disaster Opens a Window of Opportunity for Rural Poor in Northeastern Honduras."

=== Poverty reduction strategies ===
Since the 1970s when Honduras was designated a "food priority country" by the UN, organizations such as The World Food Program (WFP) have worked to decrease malnutrition and food insecurity.<ref name="www1.wfp.org">{{Cite web|url=http://www1.wfp.org/countries/honduras|title=Honduras {{!}} World Food Programme|website=www1.wfp.org|language=en|access-date=26 November 2017}}</ref> A large majority of Honduran farmers live in [[extreme poverty]], or below 180 US dollars per capita.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Rural Poverty in Latin America|last1=López|first1=Ramón|last2=Romano|first2=Claudia|date=2000|publisher=Palgrave Macmillan, London|isbn=9781349419548|pages=227–243|language=en|doi=10.1057/9780333977798_11}}</ref> Currently one fourth of children are affected by chronic malnutrition.<ref name="www1.wfp.org" /> WFP is currently working with the Honduran government on a School Feeding Program which provides meals for 21,000 Honduran schools, reaching 1.4 million school children.<ref name="www1.wfp.org" /> WFP also participates in disaster relief through reparations and emergency response in order to aid in quick recovery that tackles the effects of natural disasters on agricultural production.<ref name="www1.wfp.org" />

Honduras' [[Poverty Reduction Strategy in Honduras|Poverty Reduction Strategy]] was implemented in 1999 and aimed to cut [[extreme poverty]] in half by 2015.<ref name="econstor.eu">Klasen, Stephan; Otter, Thomas; Villalobos, Carlos (2012): The dynamics of inequality change in a highly dualistic economy: Honduras, 1991–2007, Discussion papers, Ibero America Institute for Economic Research, No. 215</ref> While spending on poverty-reduction aid increased there was only a 2.5% increase in GDP between 1999 and 2002.<ref name=":10">Cuesta, Jose.

''JSTOR'', JSTOR, https://www.jstor.org/stable/4491813.</ref> This improvement left Honduras still below that of countries that lacked aid through Poverty Reduction Strategy behind those without it.<ref name=":10" /> The World Bank believes that this inefficiency stems from a lack of focus on infrastructure and rural development.<ref name=":10" /> [[Extreme poverty]] saw a low of 36.2 percent only two years after the implementation of the strategy but then increased to 66.5 percent by 2012.<ref name="elcorreo.eu.org">Johnston, Jake, and Stephan Lefebvre.

Poverty Reduction Strategies were also intended to affect social policy through increased investment in education and health sectors.<ref name=":11">RUCKERT, ARNE. "The Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper of Honduras and the Transformations of Neoliberalism". ''Canadian Journal of Latin American and Caribbean Studies / Revue Canadienne Des Études Latino-Américaines Et Caraïbes'', vol. 35, no. 70, 2010, pp. 113–139. ''JSTOR'', JSTOR, https://www.jstor.org/stable/41800522.</ref> This was expected to lift poor communities out of poverty while also increasing the workforce as a means of stimulating the Honduran economy.<ref name=":11" /> Conditional cash transfers were used to do this by the Family Assistance Program.<ref name=":11" /> This program was restructured in 1998 in an attempt to increase effectiveness of cash transfers for health and education specifically for those in extreme poverty.<ref name=":11" /> Overall spending within Poverty Reduction Strategies have been focused on education and health sectors increasing social spending from 44% of Honduras' GDP in 2000 to 51% in 2004.<ref name=":11" />

Critics of aid from International Finance Institutions believe that the World Bank's Poverty Reduction Strategy result in little substantive change to Honduran policy.<ref name=":11" /> Poverty Reduction Strategies also excluded clear priorities, specific intervention strategy, strong commitment to the strategy and more effective macro-level economic reforms according to Jose Cuesta of Cambridge University.<ref name=":10" /> Due to this he believes that the strategy did not provide a pathway for economic development that could lift Honduras out of poverty resulting in neither lasting economic growth of poverty reduction.<ref name=":10" />

Prior to its 2009 [[2009 Honduran coup d'état|coup]] Honduras widely expanded social spending and an extreme increase in minimum wage.<ref name="elcorreo.eu.org" /> Efforts to decrease inequality were swiftly reversed following the coup.<ref name="elcorreo.eu.org" /> When Zelaya was removed from office social spending as a percent of GDP decreased from 13.3 percent in 2009 to 10.9 recent in 2012.<ref name="elcorreo.eu.org" /> This decrease in social spending exacerbated the effects of the recession, which the nation was previously relatively well equipped to deal with.<ref name="elcorreo.eu.org" />

The [[World Bank Group|World Bank]] Group Executive Board approved a plan known as the new Country Partnership Framework (CPF).<ref name="worldbank.org" /> This plan's objectives are to expand social program coverage, strengthen infrastructure, increase financing accessibility, strengthen regulatory framework and institutional capacity, improve the productivity of rural areas, strengthen natural disaster and climate change resiliency, and the buildup local governments so that violence and crime rates will decrease.<ref name=":0" /> The overall aim of the initiative is to decrease inequality and vulnerability of certain populations while increasing economic growth.<ref name="worldbank.org" /> Additionally the signing of the U.S.–Central America Free Trade Agreement (CAFTA) was meant to diversify the economy in order to promote growth and expand the range of exports the country is reliant on.<ref name="econstor.eu" />

===Economic inequality===
[[File:Tegucigalpa, Honduras - Riverside Houses.jpg|thumb|[[Slum]] in Tegucigalpa]]
Levels of income inequality in Honduras are higher than in any other Latin American country.<ref name="elcorreo.eu.org"/> Unlike other Latin American countries, inequality steadily increased in Honduras between 1991 and 2005.<ref name="econstor.eu"/> Between 2006 and 2010 inequality saw a decrease but increased again in 2010.<ref name="elcorreo.eu.org"/>

When Honduras' [[Human Development Index]] is adjusted for inequality (known as the IHDI) Honduras' development index is reduced to .443.<ref name=":1" /> The levels of inequality in each aspect of development can also be assessed.<ref name=":1" /> In 2015 inequality of life expectancy at birth was 19.6%, inequality in education was 24.4% and inequality in income was 41.5% <ref name=":1" /> The overall loss in human development due to inequality was 29.2.<ref name=":1" />

The IHDI for Latin America and the Caribbean overall is 0.575 with an overall loss of 23.4%.<ref name=":1" /> In 2015 for the entire region, inequality of life expectancy at birth was 22.9%, inequality in education was 14.0% and inequality in income was 34.9%.<ref name=":1" /> While Honduras has a higher life expectancy than other countries in the region (before and after inequality adjustments), its quality of education and economic standard of living are lower.<ref name=":1" /> Income inequality and education inequality have a large impact on the overall development of the nation.<ref name=":1" />

Inequality also exists between rural and urban areas as it relates to the distribution of resources.<ref>DeWalt, Billie R, et al. "Read 'Population and Land Use in Developing Countries: Report of a Workshop' at NAP.edu." ''National Academies Press: OpenBook'', National Research Council, www.nap.edu/read/2211/chapter/9.</ref> Poverty is concentrated in southern, eastern, and western regions where rural and indigenous peoples live. North and central Honduras are home to the country's industries and infrastructure, resulting in low levels of poverty.<ref name=":2" /> Poverty is concentrated in rural Honduras, a pattern that is reflected throughout Latin America.<ref name="cia.gov">{{Cite web|url=https://www.cia.gov/the-world-factbook/countries/honduras/|title=The World Factbook — Central Intelligence Agency|website=www.cia.gov|language=en|access-date=26 November 2017}}</ref> The effects of poverty on rural communities are vast. Poor communities typically live in adobe homes, lack material resources, have limited access to medical resources, and live off of basics such as rice, maize and beans.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.proyectomirador.org/poverty-and-crime/one-poorest-most-vulnerable-countries-world|title=One of the poorest, most vulnerable countries in the world – Proyecto Mirador|website=www.proyectomirador.org}}</ref>

The lower class predominantly consists of rural subsistence farmers and landless peasants.<ref name=":3">Merrill, Tim. ed. ''Honduras: A Country Study''. Washington: GPO for the Library of Congress, 1995.
</ref> Since 1965 there has been an increase in the number of landless peasants in Honduras which has led to a growing class of urban poor individuals.<ref name=":3" /> These individuals often migrate to urban centers in search of work in the service sector, manufacturing, or construction.<ref name=":3" /> Demographers believe that without social and economic reform, rural to urban migration will increase, resulting in the expansion of urban centers.<ref name=":3" /> Within the lower class, underemployment is a major issue.<ref name=":3" /> Individuals that are underemployed often only work as part-time laborers on seasonal farms meaning their annual income remains low.<ref name=":3" /> In the 1980s peasant organizations and labor unions such as the National Federation of Honduran Peasants, The National Association of Honduran Peasants and the National Union of Peasants formed.<ref name=":3" />

[[File:Honduras house copan.jpg|thumb|An indigenous family in a small mountain village in Honduras|alt=]]
It is not uncommon for rural individuals to voluntarily enlist in the military, however this often does not offer stable or promising career opportunities.<ref name=":8">Cameron, Samuel, et al. "It Could Be You! Military Conscription and Selection Bias in Rural Honduras." ''Revista Europea De Estudios Latinoamericanos y Del Caribe / European Review of Latin American and Caribbean Studies'', no. 68, 2000, pp. 47–63. ''JSTOR'', JSTOR, https://www.jstor.org/stable/25675865.</ref> The majority of high-ranking officials in the Honduran army are recruited from elite military academies.<ref name=":8" /> Additionally, the majority of enlistment in the military is forced.<ref name=":8" /> Forced recruitment largely relies on an alliance between the Honduran government, military and upper class Honduran society.<ref name=":8" /> In urban areas males are often sought out from secondary schools while in rural areas roadblocks aided the military in handpicking recruits.<ref name=":8" /> Higher socio-economic status enables individuals to more easily evade the draft.<ref name=":8" />

Middle class Honduras is a small group defines by relatively low membership and income levels.<ref name=":3" /> Movement from lower to middle class is typically facilitated by higher education.<ref name=":3" /> Professionals, students, farmers, merchants, business employees, and civil servants are all considered a part of the Honduran middle class.<ref name=":3" /> Opportunities for employment and the industrial and commercial sectors are slow growing, limiting middle class membership.<ref name=":3" />

The Honduran upper class has much higher income levels than the rest of the Honduran population reflecting large amounts of income inequality.<ref name=":3" /> Much of the upper class affords their success to the growth of cotton and livestock exports post-[[World War II]].<ref name=":3" /> The wealthy are not politically unified and differ in political and economic views.<ref name=":3" />

=== Trade ===
[[File:Panoramica_san_pedro_sula.jpg|thumb|500px|right|[[San Pedro Sula]] is a major center of business and commerce in Honduras, and is home to many large manufacturers and companies.

The currency is the [[Honduran lempira]].

The government operates both the electrical grid, [[Empresa Nacional de Energía Eléctrica]] (ENEE) and the land-line telephone service, [[Hondutel]]. ENEE receives heavy [[subsidies]] to counter its chronic financial problems, but Hondutel is no longer a [[monopoly]]. The telecommunication sector was opened to private investment on 25 December 2005, as required under [[CAFTA]]. The price of petroleum is regulated, and the [[National Congress of Honduras|Congress]] often ratifies temporary [[price]] regulation for basic [[commodities]].

In 2006 the [[U.S. Department of Homeland Security]] and the [[United States Department of Energy|Department of Energy]] announced the first phase of the [[Secure Freight Initiative]] (SFI), which built upon existing port security measures. SFI gave the U.S. government enhanced authority, allowing it to scan containers from overseas{{clarify|date=June 2016}} for nuclear and radiological materials in order to improve the risk assessment of individual US-bound containers. The initial phase of Secure Freight involved deploying of nuclear detection and other devices to six foreign ports:
* [[Port Qasim]] in Pakistan;
* [[Puerto Cortés]] in Honduras;
* [[Southampton]] in the United Kingdom;
* [[Port of Salalah]] in [[Oman]];
* [[Port of Singapore]];
* Gamman Terminal at [[Port of Busan|Port Busan]], Korea.

===Energy===
{{Further|Electricity sector in Honduras}}

About half of the electricity sector in Honduras is privately owned. The remaining [[electricity generation|generation]] capacity is run by [[ENEE]] (''Empresa Nacional de Energía Eléctrica'').
Key challenges in the sector are:
* Financing investments in generation and transmission without either a financially healthy utility or concessionary funds from external donors
* Re-balancing [[tariff]]s, cutting [[arrears]] and reducing losses, including electricity theft, without social unrest
* Reconciling environmental concerns with government objectives – two large new dams and associated hydropower plants.
* Improving access to electricity in rural areas.

===Transportation===

Infrastructure for [[transportation in Honduras]] consists of: {{convert|699|km|abbr=off}} [[Rail transport in Honduras|of railways]]; {{convert|13,603|km|abbr=off}} of roadways;<ref name=cia/> six ports;<ref>{{Cite web|title=WPS - Index of ports in Honduras|url=http://www.worldportsource.com/ports/index/HND.php|access-date=2020-10-15|website=World Port Source}}</ref> and 112 airports altogether (12 Paved, 100 unpaved).<ref name=cia/> The Ministry of Public Works, Transport and Housing (SOPRTRAVI in Spanish acronym) is responsible for transport sector policy.

===Water supply and sanitation===
{{Main|Water supply and sanitation in Honduras}}

[[Water supply and sanitation in Honduras]] differ greatly from urban centers to rural villages. Larger population centers generally have modernized water treatment and distribution systems, but water quality is often poor because of lack of proper maintenance and treatment. Rural areas generally have basic drinking water systems with limited capacity for water treatment. Many urban areas have sewer systems in place to collect wastewater, but proper treatment of wastewater is rare. In rural areas sanitary facilities are generally limited to latrines and basic septic pits.

Water and sanitation services were historically provided by the {{Interlanguage link multi|Servicio Autónomo de Alcantarillas y Aqueductos|es}} (SANAA). In 2003, the government enacted a new "water law" which called for the [[decentralization]] of water services. Under the 2003 law, local communities have both the right and the responsibility to own, operate, and control their own drinking water and wastewater systems. Since this law passed, many communities have joined together to address water and sanitation issues on a regional basis.

Many national and international non-government organizations have a history of working on water and sanitation projects in Honduras. International groups include the [[International Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement|Red Cross]], [[Water 1st International|Water 1st]], [[Rotary International|Rotary Club]], [[Catholic Relief Services]], Water for People, [[EcoLogic Development Fund]], [[CARE (relief)|CARE]], the [[Canadian Executive Service Organization]] (CESO-SACO), [[Engineers Without Borders – USA]], Flood The Nations, [[Students Helping Honduras]] (SHH), [[Global Brigades]], and Agua para el Pueblo<ref>{{cite web

In addition, many government organizations work on projects in Honduras, including the [[European Union]], the [[United States Agency for International Development|USAID]], the [[United States Army Corps of Engineers|Army Corps of Engineers]], Cooperacion Andalucia, the [[government of Japan]], and others.

Since 1975, emigration from Honduras has accelerated as economic migrants and political refugees sought a better life elsewhere. A majority of [[Honduran diaspora|expatriate Hondurans]] live in the United States. A 2012 US State Department estimate suggested that between 800,000 and one million Hondurans lived in the United States at that time, nearly 15% of the Honduran population.<ref name="DOS-Honduras"/> The large uncertainty about numbers is because numerous Hondurans live in the United States without a visa. In the 2010 census in the United States, 617,392 residents identified as Hondurans, up from 217,569 in 2000.<ref>{{cite web

===Race and ethnicity===
The ethnic breakdown of Honduran society was 90% [[Mestizo]], 7% American Indian, 2% Black and 1% White (2017).<ref name="cia.gov"/> The 1927 Honduran census provides no racial data but in 1930 five classifications were created: white, Indian, Negro, yellow, and mestizo.<ref name="Classifications">Vandiver, Marylee Mason. "Racial Classifications in Latin American Censuses." ''Social Forces'', vol. 28, no. 2, 1949, pp. 138–146. ''JSTOR'', JSTOR, https://www.jstor.org/stable/2572639.</ref> This system was used in the 1935 and 1940 census.<ref name="Classifications" /> Mestizo was used to describe individuals that did not fit neatly into the categories of white, Indian, negro or yellow or who are of mixed white-Indian descent.<ref name="Classifications" />

John Gillin considers Honduras to be one of thirteen "Mestizo countries" (Mexico, Guatemala, El Salvador, Nicaragua, Panama, Colombia, Venezuela, Cuba, Ecuador, Peru, Bolivia, Paraguay).<ref name=":5">GILLIN, John. "Problems of Mestizo America : A Sociological Approach / LE POINT DE VUE DU SOCIOLOGUE : L'AMERIQUE METISSE." ''Civilisations'', vol. 5, no. 4, 1955, pp. 509–521.

===Gender===
{{see also|Gender inequality in Honduras}}
The male to female ratio of the Honduran population is 1.01. This ratio stands at 1.05 at birth, 1.04 from 15 to 24 years old, 1.02 from 25 to 54 years old, .88 from 55 to 64 years old, and .77 for those 65 years or older.<ref name="cia.gov"/>

Between 1971 and 2001 Honduran total fertility rate decreased from 7.4 births to 4.4 births.<ref name=":12" /> This is largely attributable to an increase in educational attainment and workforce participation by women, as well as more widespread use of [[contraceptives]].<ref name=":12" /> In 1996 50% of women were using at least one type of contraceptive.<ref name=":12" /> By 2001 62% were largely due to [[female sterilization]], birth control in the form of a pill, injectable birth control, and IUDs.<ref name=":12" /> A study done in 2001 of Honduran men and women reflect conceptualization of reproductive health and decision making in Honduras.<ref name=":12" /> 28% of men and 25% of women surveyed believed men were responsible for decisions regarding family size and family planning uses.<ref name=":12" /> 21% of men believed men were responsible for both.<ref name=":12" />

Between 1995 and 1997 Honduras recognized domestic violence as both a public health issue and a punishable offense due to efforts by the Pan American Health Organization (PAHO).<ref name=":15" /> PAHO's subcommittee on Women, Health and Development was used as a guide to develop programs that aid in domestic violence prevention and victim assistance programs <ref name=":15" /> However, a study done in 2009 showed that while the policy requires health care providers to report cases of sexual violence, emergency contraception, and victim referral to legal institutions and support groups, very few other regulations exist within the realm of registry, examination and follow-up.<ref name=":17">Reyes, H Luz McNaughton, et al.

===Languages===
[[Spanish language|Spanish]] is the official, national language, spoken by virtually all [[Hondurans]]. In addition to Spanish, a number of indigenous languages are spoken in some small communities. Other languages spoken by some include Honduran sign language and [[Bay Islands Creole English]].<ref name=Ethnologue>{{cite web|url=http://www.ethnologue.com/sites/default/files/Ethnologue-17-Honduras.pdf|title=Ethnologue: Languages of Honduras, Seventeenth edition data M.

* [[Mískito language|Mískito]] ([[Misumalpan languages|Misumalpan]]) (29,000 speakers in Honduras)
* [[Sumu language|Mayangna]] ([[Misumalpan languages|Misumalpan]]) (less than 1000 speakers in Honduras, more in [[Nicaragua]])

* [[Jicaque language|Tol]] ([[Jicaquean languages|Jicaquean]]) (less than 500 speakers)
* [[Ch'orti' language|Ch'orti']] ([[Mayan languages|Mayan]]) (less than 50 speakers)

The [[Lenca language|Lenca]] isolate lost all its fluent native speakers in the 20th century but is currently undergoing revival efforts among the members of the ethnic population of about 100,000. The largest immigrant languages are Arabic (42,000), Armenian (1,300), Turkish (900), Yue Chinese (1,000).<ref name=Ethnologue/>

Although most Hondurans are nominally [[Roman Catholic]] (which would be considered the main religion), membership in the [[Roman Catholic Church]] is declining while membership in Protestant churches is increasing. The International Religious Freedom Report, 2008, notes that a CID Gallup poll reported that 51.4% of the population identified themselves as [[Catholic]], 36.2% as [[evangelical]] [[Protestant]], 1.3% claiming to be from other religions, including [[Muslims]], [[Buddhists]], [[Jews]], [[Rastafarians]], etc. and 11.1% do not belong to any religion or unresponsive. 8% reported as being either atheistic or agnostic. Customary Catholic church tallies and membership estimates 81% Catholic where the priest (in more than 185 parishes) is required to fill out a pastoral account of the parish each year.<ref>{{cite book|title=Annuario Pontificio|year=2009|isbn=978-88209-81914|publisher=[[Cardinal Secretary of State]]}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|title=Catholic Almanac|first1=Matthew E.|last1=Bunson|first2=D.|last2=Min|location=Huntington, Ind.|publisher=Sunday Visitor Publishing|date=4 November 2015|isbn=978-1612789446|pages=312–13}}</ref>

Its [[archbishop]], [[Óscar Rodríguez Maradiaga|Óscar Andrés Rodriguez Maradiaga]], is also very popular, both with the government, other churches, and in his own church. Practitioners of the [[Buddhism|Buddhist]], Jewish, Islamic, [[Baháʼí Faith|Baháʼí]], [[Rastafari movement|Rastafari]] and indigenous denominations and religions exist.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://2001-2009.state.gov/g/drl/rls/irf/2008/108530.htm |title=International Religious Freedom Report 2008: Honduras |publisher=U.S. Department of State |date=19 September 2008 |access-date=9 February 2016}}</ref>

=== Crime ===
{{Main|Crime in Honduras}}

Crime in Honduras is rampant and criminals operate with a high degree of impunity. Honduras has one of the highest murder rates in the world. Official statistics from the Honduran Observatory on National Violence show Honduras' homicide rate was 60 per 100,000 in 2015 with the majority of homicide cases unprosecuted.<ref name="Travel Warnings">{{cite web|title=Honduras Travel Warning|url=https://travel.state.gov/content/passports/en/alertswarnings/honduras-travel-warning.html|website=Travel.State.Gov|publisher=U.S. State Department|access-date=17 August 2016|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160817232455/https://travel.state.gov/content/passports/en/alertswarnings/honduras-travel-warning.html|archive-date=17 August 2016}}</ref>

Highway assaults and carjackings at roadblocks or checkpoints set up by criminals with police uniforms and equipment occur frequently. Although reports of kidnappings of foreigners are not common, families of kidnapping victims often pay ransoms without reporting the crime to police out of fear of retribution, so kidnapping figures may be underreported.<ref name="Travel Warnings"/>

Owing to measures taken by government and business in 2014 to improve tourist safety, Roatan and the Bay Islands have lower crime rates than the Honduran mainland.<ref name="Travel Warnings"/>

In the less populated region of Gracias a Dios, narcotics-trafficking is rampant and police presence is scarce. Threats against U.S. citizens by drug traffickers and other criminal organizations have resulted in the U.S. Embassy placing restrictions on the travel of U.S. officials through the region.<ref name="Travel Warnings"/>

Honduras has experienced a boom from its film industry for the past two decades. Since the premiere of the movie "Anita la cazadora de insectos" in 2001, the level of Honduran productions has increased, many collaborating with countries such as Mexico, Colombia, and the U.S. The most well known Honduran films are "El Xendra", "Amor y Frijoles", and "Cafe con aroma a mi tierra".

=== Cuisine ===
{{Further|Honduran cuisine}}

Honduran cuisine is a fusion of indigenous [[Lenca]] cuisine, [[Cuisine of Spain|Spanish cuisine]], [[Caribbean cuisine]] and [[African cuisine]]. There are also dishes from the [[Garifuna people]]. [[Coconut]] and coconut milk are featured in both sweet and savory dishes. Regional specialties include fried [[Fish (food)|fish]], [[tamale]]s, [[carne asada]] and [[baleada]]s.

Other popular dishes include: meat roasted with [[chismol]] and [[carne asada]], chicken with rice and corn, and fried fish with pickled onions and jalapeños. Some of the ways seafood and some meats are prepared in coastal areas and in the [[Bay Islands Department|Bay Islands]] involve [[coconut]] milk.

The soups Hondurans enjoy include [[bean]] soup, mondongo soup ([[tripe]] soup), [[seafood]] soups and [[beef]] soups. Generally these soups are served mixed with [[plantain (cooking)|plantains]], [[cassava|yuca]], and cabbage, and served with [[Maize|corn]] [[tortilla]]s.

Other typical dishes are the montucas or corn [[tamale]]s, stuffed tortillas, and tamales wrapped in [[Plantain (cooking)|plantain]] leaves. Honduran typical dishes also include an abundant selection of tropical fruits such as [[papaya]], [[pineapple]], [[plum]], [[sapote]], [[passion fruit]] and bananas which are prepared in many ways while they are still green.

=== Media ===
{{Further|Media of Honduras}}
At least half of Honduran households have at least one television. Public television has a far smaller role than in most other countries. Honduras' main newspapers are [[La Prensa (Honduras)|La Prensa]], [[El Heraldo (Tegucigalpa)|El Heraldo]], [[La Tribuna (Honduras)|La Tribuna]] and Diario Tiempo. The official newspaper is {{Interlanguage link multi|La Gaceta (Honduras)|es|3=La Gaceta}}.

=== Music ===
{{Further|Music of Honduras}}

[[Punta]] is the main music of Honduras, with other sounds such as Caribbean salsa, [[merengue music|merengue]], reggae, and [[reggaeton]] all widely heard, especially in the north, and Mexican [[ranchera]]s heard in the rural interior of the country. The most well known musicians are Guillermo Anderson and Polache.

===Celebrations===
{{Further|Public holidays in Honduras}}

[[File:Saw dust carpet Comayagua Honduras (1).jpg|thumb|[[Sawdust carpet]]s of [[Comayagua]] during [[Easter]] celebrations|301x301px]]
Some of Honduras' national holidays include Honduras Independence Day on 15 September and Children's Day or Día del Niño, which is celebrated in homes, schools and churches on 10 September; on this day, children receive presents and have parties similar to Christmas or birthday celebrations. Some neighborhoods have piñatas on the street. Other holidays are Easter, [[Maundy Thursday]], [[Good Friday]], Day of the Soldier (3 October to celebrate the birth of [[Francisco Morazán]]), Christmas, El Dia de [[Lempira (Lenca ruler)|Lempira]] on 20 July,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.marrder.com/htw/jun99/cultural.htm |title=Honduras This Week Online June 1999 |publisher=Marrder.com |date=9 December 1991 |access-date=27 June 2010 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110117130102/http://www.marrder.com/htw/jun99/cultural.htm |archive-date=17 January 2011}}</ref> and New Year's Eve.

Honduras Independence Day festivities start early in the morning with marching bands. Each band wears different colors and features cheerleaders. Fiesta Catracha takes place this same day: typical Honduran foods such as [[bean]]s, [[tamale]]s, baleadas, [[cassava]] with [[chicharrón]], and [[tortilla]]s are offered.

On Christmas Eve people reunite with their families and close friends to have dinner, then give out presents at midnight. In some cities fireworks are seen and heard at midnight. On New Year's Eve there is food and "cohetes", fireworks and festivities. Birthdays are also great events, and include piñatas filled with candies and surprises for the children.

[[La Ceiba Carnival]] is celebrated in [[La Ceiba]], a city located in the north coast, in the second half of May to celebrate the day of the city's patron saint [[Isidore the Laborer|Saint Isidore]]. People from all over the world come for one week of festivities. Every night there is a little carnaval (carnavalito) in a neighborhood. On Saturday there is a big parade with floats and displays with people from many countries. This celebration is also accompanied by the Milk Fair, where many Hondurans come to show off their farm products and animals.

===National symbols===
[[File:Ara macao - two at Lowry Park Zoo.jpg|thumb|upright=0.9|The national bird, ''[[Ara macao]]'']]
The [[flag of Honduras]] is composed of three equal horizontal stripes. The blue upper and lower stripes represent the Pacific Ocean and the Caribbean Sea. The central stripe is white. It contains five blue stars representing the five states of the [[Federal Republic of Central America|Central American Union]]. The middle star represents Honduras, located in the center of the Central American Union.

The coat of arms was established in 1945. It is an equilateral triangle, at the base is a volcano between three castles, over which is a rainbow and the sun shining. The triangle is placed on an area that symbolizes being bathed by both seas. Around all of this an oval containing in golden lettering: "Republic of Honduras, Free, Sovereign and Independent".

The "[[National Anthem of Honduras]]" is a result of a contest carried out in 1914 during the presidency of [[Manuel Bonilla]]. In the end, it was the poet [[Augusto Coello]] that ended up writing the anthem, with German-born Honduran composer [[Carlos Hartling]] writing the music. The anthem was officially adopted on 15 November 1915, during the presidency of {{Interlanguage link multi|Alberto de Jesús Membreño|es|3=Alberto Membreño}}. The anthem is composed of a choir and seven stroonduran.{{clarify|date=June 2016}}

The national flower is the famous orchid, ''[[Rhyncholaelia]] digbyana'' (formerly known as ''Brassavola digbyana''), which replaced the rose in 1969. The change of the national flower was carried out during the administration of general [[Oswaldo López Arellano]], thinking that ''Brassavola digbyana'' "is an indigenous plant of Honduras; having this flower exceptional characteristics of beauty, vigor and distinction", as the decree dictates it.

The national tree of Honduras was declared in 1928 to be simply "the Pine that appears symbolically in our [[Coat of Arms]]" (''el Pino que figura simbólicamente en nuestro Escudo''),<ref>Acuerdo No. 429, 14 de mayo de 1928.</ref> even though [[pine]]s comprise a [[genus]] and not a [[species]], and even though legally there's no specification as for what kind of pine should appear in the coat of arms ''either''. Because of its commonality in the country, the ''[[Pinus oocarpa]]'' species has become since then the species most strongly associated as the national tree, but legally it is not so. Another species associated as the national tree is the ''[[Pinus caribaea]]''.

The national mammal is the [[white-tailed deer]] (''Odocoileus virginianus''), which was adopted as a measure to avoid excessive depredation.{{clarify|date=July 2016}} It is one of two species of deer that live in Honduras.
The national bird of Honduras is the [[scarlet macaw]] (''Ara macao''). This bird was much valued by the pre-Columbian civilizations of Honduras.

===Folklore===
Legends and fairy tales are paramount in Honduran culture. [[Lluvia de Peces]] (Rain of Fish) is an example of this. The legends of El [[Cadejo]] and [[La Llorona]] are also popular.

===Sports===
[[File:Estadio_Olimpico_Metropolitano_de_San_Pedro_Sula_2017_04.jpg|thumb|Football is a very popular sport in Honduras. [[Estadio Olímpico Metropolitano]] in [[San Pedro Sula]].]]

== Etymology ==
{{Main|Name of Hungary}}
The "H" in the name of Hungary (and Latin ''Hungaria'') is most likely due to founded historical associations with the [[Huns]], who had settled Hungary prior to the [[Pannonian Avars|Avars]]. The rest of the word comes from the Latinized form of [[medieval Greek|Byzantine Greek]] ''Oungroi'' (Οὔγγροι). The Greek name was borrowed from [[Old Church Slavonic|Old Bulgarian]] ''ągrinŭ'', in turn borrowed from [[Oghur languages|Oghur-Turkic]] ''[[Onogurs|Onogur]]'' ('ten [tribes of the] [[Ogur]]s'). ''Onogur'' was the collective name for the tribes who later joined the [[Bulgars|Bulgar]] tribal confederacy that ruled the eastern parts of Hungary after the Avars.<ref name="Király">{{cite book | last = Király | first = Péter | title = A magyarok elnevezése a korai európai forrásokban ''(The Names of the Magyars in Early European Sources)'' /In: Honfoglalás és nyelvészet ("The Occupation of Our county" and Linguistics)/ | publisher = Balassi Kiadó | date = 1997 | location = Budapest | url = http://webshop.animare.hu/honfoglalas+es+nyelveszet+83813.html | isbn = 978-963-506-108-2 | page = 266}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|title=A History of Hungary|editor=Peter F.

The Hungarian [[endonym]] is ''Magyarország'', composed of ''magyar'' ('Hungarian') and ''ország'' ('country'). The name "Magyar", which refers to the people of the country, more accurately reflects the name of the country in some other languages such as [[Turkish language|Turkish]], [[Persian language|Persian]] and other languages as ''Magyaristan'' or ''Land of Magyars'' or similar. The word ''magyar'' is taken from the name of one of the seven major semi-nomadic Hungarian tribes, ''magyeri''.<ref>György Balázs, Károly Szelényi, [https://books.google.com/books?id=4NlnAAAAMAAJ The Magyars: the birth of a European nation], Corvina, 1989, p. 8</ref><ref>Alan W.

[[File:Hungarian warrior.jpg|thumb|Italian fresco depicting a Hungarian warrior shooting backwards]]
The [[Roman Empire]] conquered the territory west of the Danube River between 35 and 9&nbsp;BC. From 9&nbsp;BC to the end of the 4th century AD, [[Pannonia]], the western part of the Carpathian Basin, was part of the Roman Empire. After the Western Roman Empire collapsed in the 5th century AD under the stress of the migration of [[Germanic peoples|Germanic tribes]] and [[Carpi (people)|Carpian]] pressure, the Migration Period continued to bring many invaders into Central Europe, beginning with the [[Huns|Hunnic Empire]] (c. 370–469). The most powerful ruler of the Hunnic Empire was [[Attila the Hun]] (434–453) who later became a central figure in Hungarian mythology. After the disintegration of the Hunnic Empire, the [[Gepids]], an Eastern Germanic tribe, who had been vassalized by the Huns, established their own kingdom in the Carpathian Basin. Other groups which reached the Carpathian Basin in the Migration Period were the [[Goths]], [[Vandals]], [[Lombards]], and [[Early Slavs|Slavs]]. In the 560s, the [[Pannonian Avars|Avars]] founded the Avar Khaganate, a state that maintained supremacy in the region for more than two centuries. The Franks under [[Charlemagne]] defeated the Avars in a series of campaigns during the 790s. By the mid-9th century, the [[Pannonian Slavs#Principality|Balaton Principality]], also known as Lower Pannonia, was established west of the Danube river as part of the Frankish [[March of Pannonia]]. The [[First Bulgarian Empire]] conquered the lands east of the Danube river and took over rule of the local Slavic tribes and remnants of the Avars.

==== Age of elected kings ====
{{Main|Ottoman–Hungarian Wars}}
[[File:Louis's kingdoms and his vassal territories.png|thumb|left|upright=1.45|A map of lands ruled by [[Louis I of Hungary|Louis the Great]]]]

The [[Kingdom of Hungary]] reached one of its greatest extents during the Árpádian kings, yet royal power was weakened at the end of their rule in 1301. After a destructive period of [[interregnum]] (1301–1308), the first [[Capetian House of Anjou|Angevin]] king, [[Charles I of Hungary]] – a bilineal descendant of the Árpád dynasty – successfully restored royal power, and defeated oligarch rivals, the so-called "little kings". The second Angevin Hungarian king, [[Louis I of Hungary|Louis the Great]] (1342–1382), led many successful military campaigns from Lithuania to Southern Italy (Kingdom of Naples), and was also [[King of Poland]] from 1370. After King Louis died without a male heir, the country was stabilized only when [[Sigismund, Holy Roman Emperor|Sigismund of Luxembourg]] (1387–1437) succeeded to the throne, who in 1433 also became [[Holy Roman Emperor]]. Sigismund was also (in several ways) a bilineal descendant of the Árpád dynasty.

[[File:The wars of Matthias Corvinus of Hungary (1458-1490).png|thumb|upright=1.25|Western conquests of [[Matthias Corvinus]]]]

The first Hungarian [[Bible translation]] was completed in 1439. For half a year in 1437, there was an antifeudal and anticlerical peasant revolt in [[Transylvania]], the [[Budai Nagy Antal Revolt]], which was strongly influenced by [[Hussite]] ideas.

From a small noble family in Transylvania, [[John Hunyadi]] grew to become one of the country's most powerful lords, thanks to his outstanding capabilities as a mercenary commander. He was elected governor then regent. He was a successful crusader against the Ottoman Turks, one of his greatest victories being the [[Siege of Belgrade (1456)|Siege of Belgrade]] in 1456.

The last strong king of medieval Hungary was the Renaissance king [[Matthias Corvinus]] (1458–1490), son of John Hunyadi. His election was the first time that a member of the nobility mounted to the Hungarian royal throne without dynastic background. He was a successful military leader and an enlightened patron of the arts and learning.<ref name="britannica1">{{cite encyclopedia|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/276730/Hungary#tab=active~checked%2Citems~checked&title=Hungary%20--%20Britannica%20Online%20Encyclopedia |title=Hungary – Britannica Online Encyclopedia |encyclopedia=Britannica.com |access-date=21 November 2008}}</ref> His library, the [[Bibliotheca Corviniana]], was Europe's greatest collection of historical chronicles, philosophic and scientific works in the 15th century, and second only in size to the [[Vatican Library]].

The serfs and common people considered him a just ruler because he protected them from excessive demands from and other abuses by the magnates.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://countrystudies.us/hungary/9.htm |title=Hungary&nbsp;– Renaissance And Reformation |publisher=Countrystudies.us |access-date=20 September 2009}}</ref> Under his rule, in 1479, the Hungarian army destroyed the Ottoman and Wallachian troops at the [[Battle of Breadfield]]. Abroad he defeated the Polish and German imperial armies of Frederick at Breslau ([[Wrocław]]). Matthias' mercenary standing army, the [[Black Army of Hungary]], was an unusually large army for its time, and it conquered parts of Austria, Vienna (1485) and parts of [[Bohemia]].

==== Decline of Hungary (1490–1526) ====
King Matthias died without lawful sons, and the Hungarian magnates procured the accession of the Pole [[Vladislaus II of Bohemia and Hungary|Vladislaus II]] (1490–1516), supposedly because of his weak influence on Hungarian aristocracy.<ref name="britannica1" /> Hungary's international role declined, its political stability shaken, and social progress was deadlocked.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://geography.about.com/gi/dynamic/offsite.htm?site=http://lcweb2.loc.gov/frd/cs/hutoc.html |archive-url=https://archive.today/20120708070759/http://geography.about.com/gi/dynamic/offsite.htm?site=http://lcweb2.loc.gov/frd/cs/hutoc.html |url-status=dead |archive-date=8 July 2012 |title=A Country Study: Hungary |publisher=Geography.about.com |access-date=20 September 2009 }}</ref> In 1514, the weakened old King Vladislaus II faced a major peasant rebellion led by [[György Dózsa]], which was ruthlessly crushed by the [[Nobility in the Kingdom of Hungary|nobles]], led by [[John Zápolya]].

The resulting degradation of order paved the way for Ottoman pre-eminence. In 1521, the strongest Hungarian fortress in the South, Nándorfehérvár (today's [[Belgrade]], Serbia), [[Siege of Belgrade (1521)|fell to the Turks]]. The early appearance of Protestantism further worsened internal relations in the country.

After some [[Ottoman wars in Europe|150 years of wars]] with the Hungarians and other states, the Ottomans gained a decisive victory over the Hungarian army at the [[Battle of Mohács]] in 1526, where [[Louis II of Hungary|King Louis II]] died while fleeing. Amid political chaos, the divided [[Nobility in the Kingdom of Hungary|Hungarian nobility]] elected two kings simultaneously, [[John Zápolya]] and [[Ferdinand I, Holy Roman Emperor|Ferdinand I]] of the Habsburg dynasty. With the conquest of Buda by the Turks in 1541, Hungary was divided into three parts and remained so until the end of the 17th century. The north-western part, termed as [[Royal Hungary]], was annexed by the Habsburgs who ruled as Kings of Hungary. The eastern part of the kingdom became independent as the [[Principality of Transylvania (1571–1711)|Principality of Transylvania]], under Ottoman (and later Habsburg) [[suzerainty]]. The remaining central area, including the capital Buda, was known as the [[Ottoman Hungary|Pashalik of Buda]].

The vast majority of the seventeen and nineteen thousand Ottoman soldiers in service in the Ottoman fortresses in the territory of Hungary were Orthodox and Muslim Balkan Slavs rather than ethnic Turkish people.<ref>Laszlo Kontler, "A History of Hungary" p. 145</ref> Orthodox Southern Slavs were also acting as [[akinji]]s and other light troops intended for pillaging in the territory of present-day Hungary.<ref>Inalcik Halil: "The Ottoman Empire"</ref> In 1686, the [[Holy League (1684)|Holy League's]] army, containing over 74,000 men from various nations, [[Battle of Buda (1686)|reconquered Buda]] from the Turks.

Between 1703 and 1711, there was a large-scale uprising led by [[Francis II Rákóczi]], who after the dethronement of the Habsburgs in 1707 at the Diet of [[Ónod]], took power provisionally as the Ruling Prince of Hungary for the wartime period, but refused the Hungarian Crown and the title "King". The uprisings lasted for years. The Hungarian [[Kuruc]] army, although taking over most of the country, lost the main [[Battle of Trencsén|battle at Trencsén]] (1708). Three years later, because of the growing desertion, defeatism and low morale, the Kuruc forces finally surrendered.<ref>{{cite book|author=Paul Lendvai|title=The Hungarians: A Thousand Years of Victory in Defeat|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=UtIr97n3tP0C&pg=PA152|year=2003|publisher=C.

During the [[Napoleonic Wars]] and afterwards, the Hungarian Diet had not convened for decades.<ref>Peter N Stearns, The Oxford encyclopedia of the modern world, Volume 4, Oxford University Press, 2008, p. 64</ref> In the 1820s, the Emperor was forced to convene the Diet, which marked the beginning of a Reform Period (1825–1848, {{lang-hu|reformkor}}). Count [[István Széchenyi]], one of the most prominent statesmen of the country, recognised the urgent need of modernisation and his message got through. The Hungarian Parliament was reconvened in 1825 to handle financial needs. A liberal party emerged and focused on providing for the peasantry. [[Lajos Kossuth]] – a famous journalist at that time – emerged as leader of the lower [[gentry]] in the Parliament. A remarkable upswing started as the nation concentrated its forces on modernisation even though the Habsburg monarchs obstructed all important liberal laws relating to [[civil and political rights]] and economic reforms. Many reformers ([[Lajos Kossuth]], [[Mihály Táncsics]]) were imprisoned by the authorities.

On 15 March 1848, mass demonstrations in Pest and Buda enabled Hungarian reformists to push through a list of [[12 points of the Hungarian Revolutionaries of 1848|12 demands]]. Under governor and president [[Lajos Kossuth]] and the first Prime Minister, [[Lajos Batthyány]], the [[House of Habsburg]] was dethroned.
The Habsburg Ruler and his advisors skilfully manipulated the Croatian, Serbian and Romanian peasantry, led by priests and officers firmly loyal to the Habsburgs, and induced them to rebel against the Hungarian government, though the Hungarians were supported by the vast majority of the Slovak, German and [[Rusyns|Rusyn]] nationalities and by all the Jews of the kingdom, as well as by a large number of Polish, Austrian and Italian volunteers.<ref>[http://www.hungarianhistory.com/lib/jeszenszky/ethnic.pdf Géza Jeszenszky: From "Eastern Switzerland" to Ethnic Cleansing], address at Duquesne History Forum, 17 November 2000, The author is former Ambassador of Hungary to the United States and was Foreign Minister in 1990{{spaced ndash}}1994.</ref> In July 1849 the Hungarian Parliament proclaimed and enacted the first laws of ethnic and [[minority rights]] in the world.<ref>Laszlo Peter, Martyn C.

The Hungarian forces (''[[Royal Hungarian Landwehr|Honvédség]]'') defeated Austrian armies. To counter the successes of the Hungarian revolutionary army, Habsburg Emperor [[Franz Joseph I]] asked for help from the "Gendarme of Europe", Tsar [[Nicholas I of Russia|Nicholas I]], whose Russian armies invaded Hungary. This made [[Artúr Görgey]] surrender in August 1849. The leader of the Austrian army, [[Julius Jacob von Haynau]], became governor of Hungary for a few months, and ordered the execution of [[the 13 Martyrs of Arad]], leaders of the Hungarian army, and Prime Minister Batthyány in October 1849. Lajos Kossuth escaped into exile. Following the war of 1848{{spaced ndash}}1849, the whole country was in "passive resistance".

Because of external and internal problems, reforms seemed inevitable and major military defeats of Austria forced the Habsburgs to negotiate the [[Austro-Hungarian Compromise of 1867]], by which the dual Monarchy of [[Austria–Hungary]] was formed. This Empire had the second largest area in Europe (after the [[Russian Empire]]), and it was the third most populous (after Russia and the [[German Empire]]). The two realms were governed separately by two parliaments from two capital cities, with a common monarch and common external and military policies. Economically, the empire was a customs union. The old Hungarian Constitution was restored, and Franz Joseph I was crowned as [[King of Hungary]]. The era witnessed impressive economic development. The formerly backward Hungarian economy became relatively modern and industrialised by the turn of the 20th century, although agriculture remained dominant until 1890. In 1873, the old capital [[Buda]] and [[Óbuda]] were officially united with [[Pest, Hungary|Pest]],<ref>{{cite book|author=Kinga Frojimovics|title=Jewish Budapest: Monuments, Rites, History|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-wUg6rlWS2kC&pg=PA67|year=1999|publisher=Central European University Press|isbn=978-963-9116-37-5|page=67}}</ref> thus creating the new metropolis of [[Budapest]]. Many of the state institutions and the modern administrative system of Hungary were established during this period.

After the [[Assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand]] in Sarajevo, the Hungarian prime minister [[István Tisza]] and his cabinet tried to avoid the outbreak and escalating of a war in Europe, but their diplomatic efforts were unsuccessful. [[Austria–Hungary]] drafted 9&nbsp;million (fighting forces: 7.8&nbsp;million) soldiers in World War I (over 4&nbsp;million from the Kingdom of Hungary) on the side of Germany, Bulgaria and Turkey. The troops raised in the Kingdom of Hungary spent little time defending the actual territory of Hungary, with the exceptions of the [[Brusilov Offensive]] in June 1916, and a few months later, when the Romanian army made an attack into Transylvania,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.worldwar2.ro/arme/?language=ro&article=114|title=WorldWar2.ro – Ofensiva Armatei 2 romane in Transilvania|website=Worldwar2.ro|access-date=3 August 2017}}</ref>{{sps|date=January 2021}} both of which were repelled. In comparison, of the total army, Hungary's loss ratio was more than any other nations of Austria-Hungary. The [[Central Powers]] conquered Serbia. Romania declared war. The Central Powers conquered Southern Romania and the Romanian capital [[Bucharest]]. In 1916 Emperor Franz Joseph died, and the new monarch [[Charles IV of Hungary|Charles IV]] sympathized with the pacifists. With great difficulty, the Central powers stopped and repelled the attacks of the Russian Empire.

The Eastern front of the Allied ([[Allies of World War I|Entente]]) Powers completely collapsed. The Austro-Hungarian Empire then withdrew from all defeated countries. On the Italian front, the Austro-Hungarian army made no progress against Italy after January 1918. Despite great Eastern successes, Germany suffered complete defeat on the more important Western front. By 1918, the economic situation had deteriorated (strikes in factories were organised by leftist and pacifist movements) and uprisings in the army had become commonplace. In the capital cities, the Austrian and Hungarian leftist liberal movements (the maverick parties) and their leaders supported the separatism of ethnic minorities. Austria-Hungary signed a general armistice in [[Padua]] on 3 November 1918.<ref>{{cite book|author=François Bugnion|title=The International Committee of the Red Cross and the Protection of War Victims|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=6K9IAAAAYAAJ|year=2003|publisher=Macmillan Education|isbn=978-0-333-74771-1}}</ref> In October 1918, Hungary's union with Austria was dissolved.

Following the First World War, Hungary underwent a period of profound political upheaval, beginning with the [[Aster Revolution]] in 1918, which brought the social-democratic [[Mihály Károlyi]] to power as Prime Minister. The [[Royal Hungarian Honvéd|Hungarian Royal Honvéd army]] still had more than 1,400,000 soldiers<ref>{{cite book|author=Martin Kitchen|author-link=Martin Kitchen|title=Europe Between the Wars|publisher=[[Routledge]]|year=2014|page=190|isbn=9781317867531|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=36WsAgAAQBAJ&pg=PA190}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|author=Ignác Romsics|title=Dismantling of Historic Hungary: The Peace Treaty of Trianon, 1920 Issue 3 of CHSP Hungarian authors series East European monographs|publisher=Social Science Monographs|year=2002|page=62|isbn=9780880335058}}</ref> when Mihály Károlyi was announced as prime minister of Hungary.

During the rule of Károlyi's pacifist cabinet, Hungary lost the control over approx. 75% of its former pre-WW1 territories (325 411&nbsp;km{{sup|2}}) without fight and was subject to foreign occupation. The [[Little Entente]], sensing an opportunity, invaded the country from three sides—Romania [[Hungarian-Romanian War|invaded]] [[Transylvania]], Czechoslovakia annexed [[Upper Hungary]] (today's Slovakia), and a joint [[Kingdom of Serbia|Serb]]-[[French Army|French]] coalition annexed [[Vojvodina]] and other southern regions. In March 1919, communists led by [[Béla Kun]] ousted the Károlyi government and proclaimed the [[Hungarian Soviet Republic]] (''Tanácsköztársaság''), followed by a thorough [[Red Terror (Hungary)|Red Terror]] campaign. Despite some successes on the Czechoslovak front, Kun's forces were ultimately unable to resist the Romanian invasion; by August 1919, Romanian troops occupied Budapest and ousted Kun.

[[File:Portraits de Miklós Horthy.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Miklós Horthy]], Regent of the Kingdom of Hungary (1920–1944)]]

In November 1919, rightist forces led by former Austro-Hungarian admiral [[Miklós Horthy]] entered Budapest; exhausted by the war and its aftermath, the populace accepted Horthy's leadership. In January 1920, parliamentary elections were held and Horthy was proclaimed Regent of the reestablished [[Kingdom of Hungary (1920–46)|Kingdom of Hungary]], inaugurating the so-called "Horthy era" (''Horthy-kor''). The new government worked quickly to normalize foreign relations while turning a blind eye to a [[White Terror (Hungary)|White Terror]] that swept through the countryside; extrajudicial killings of suspected communists and Jews lasted well into 1920. On 4 June of that year, the [[Treaty of Trianon]] established new borders for Hungary. The country lost 71% of its territory and 66% of its antebellum population, as well as many sources of raw materials and its sole [[port]], [[Rijeka|Fiume]].<ref name="Macartney37">{{cite book| last=Macartney| first =C.

The initial years of the Horthy regime were preoccupied by putsch attempts by [[Charles IV of Hungary|Charles IV]], the Austro-Hungarian [[pretender]]; continued suppression of communists; and a migration crisis triggered by the Trianon territorial changes. Though free elections continued, Horthy's personality, and those of his personally selected prime ministers, dominated the political scene. The government's actions continued to drift right with the passage of antisemitic laws and, due to the continued isolation of the Little Entente, economic and then political gravitation towards [[Kingdom of Italy#Fascist regime (1922–1943)|Italy]] and [[Nazi Germany|Germany]]. The [[Great Depression]] further exacerbated the situation and the popularity of fascist politicians such as [[Gyula Gömbös]] and [[Ferenc Szálasi]], promising economic and social recovery, rose.

Horthy's nationalist agenda reached its apogee in 1938 and 1940, when the Nazis rewarded Hungary's staunchly pro-Germany foreign policy in the [[First Vienna Award|First]] and [[Second Vienna Award]]s, respectively, peacefully restoring ethnic-Hungarian-majority areas lost after Trianon. In 1939, Hungary regained further territory from Czechoslovakia [[Slovak-Hungarian War|through force]]. Hungary [[Tripartite Pact|formally joined]] the [[Axis Powers]] on 20 November 1940, and in 1941, participated in the [[German invasion of Yugoslavia|invasion of Yugoslavia]], gaining some of its former territories in the south.

Hungary formally entered World War II as an Axis Power on 26 June 1941, declaring war on the [[Soviet Union]] after unidentified planes bombed [[Košice|Kassa]], [[Munkacheve|Munkács]], and [[Rakhiv|Rahó]].

Learning of the planned defection, German troops [[Operation Margarethe|occupied Hungary]] on 19 March 1944 to guarantee Horthy's compliance. In October, as the Soviet front approached and the Hungarian government made further efforts to disengage from the war, German troops ousted Horthy and installed a puppet government under Szálasi's fascist [[Arrow Cross Party]].<ref name="J. Lee Ready 1995 page 130" /> Szálasi pledged all the country's capabilities in service of the German war machine. By October 1944, the Soviets had reached the river Tisza, and despite [[Battle of Debrecen|some losses]], succeeded in encircling and [[Battle of Budapest|besieging Budapest]] in December.

A memo setting out policy for the BBC Hungarian Service in 1942 states: "We shouldn't mention the Jews at all". By 1943, the BBC Polish Service was broadcasting the exterminations. And yet his policy of silence on the Jews was followed until the German invasion in March 1944. After the tanks rolled in, the Hungarian Service did then broadcast warnings. But by then it was too late "Many Hungarian Jews who survived the deportations claimed that they had not been informed by their leaders, that no one had told them. But there's plenty of evidence that they could have known," said David Cesarani, professor of history at Royal Holloway, University of London.}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ushmm.org/wlc/en/article.php?ModuleId=10007259 |title=Auschwitz: Chronology |publisher=Ushmm.org |access-date=13 February 2013}}</ref> During the German occupation in May–June 1944, the Arrow Cross and Hungarian police deported nearly 440,000 Jews, mainly to [[Auschwitz concentration camp|Auschwitz]].

On 13 February 1945, Budapest surrendered; by April, German troops left the country under Soviet military occupation. 200,000 Hungarians were expelled from Czechoslovakia in exchange for 70,000 Slovaks living in Hungary. 202,000 ethnic Germans were expelled to Germany,<ref>Alfred de Zayas "A Terrible Revenge" (Palgrave/Macmillan 2006)</ref> and through the 1947 [[Paris Peace Treaties]], Hungary was again reduced to its immediate post-Trianon borders.

=== Communism (1945–1989) ===
{{Main|Hungarian Republic (1946–49)|Hungarian People's Republic|Hungarian Revolution of 1956}}

Following the defeat of Nazi Germany, Hungary became a [[Soviet satellite|satellite state]] of the Soviet Union. The Soviet leadership selected [[Mátyás Rákosi]] to front the [[Stalinization]] of the country, and Rákosi ''de facto'' ruled Hungary from 1949 to 1956. His government's policies of militarization, industrialisation, collectivization, and war compensation led to a severe decline in living standards. In imitation of Stalin's [[KGB]], the Rákosi government established a secret political police, the [[State Protection Authority|ÁVH]], to enforce the new regime. In the ensuing purges approximately 350,000 officials and intellectuals were imprisoned or executed from 1948 to 1956.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.tamupress.com/product/First-Domino,4091.aspx |title=Granville/ frm |format=PDF |access-date=20 September 2009}}</ref> Many freethinkers, democrats, and Horthy-era dignitaries were secretly arrested and extrajudicially interned in domestic and foreign [[Gulag]]s.

After Stalin's death in 1953, the Soviet Union pursued a programme of [[destalinization]] that was inimical to Rákosi, leading to his deposition. The following political cooling saw the ascent of [[Imre Nagy]] to the premiership, and the growing interest of students and intellectuals in political life. Nagy promised market liberalization and political openness, while Rákosi opposed both vigorously. Rákosi eventually managed to discredit Nagy and replace him with the more hard-line [[Ernő Gerő]]. Hungary joined the [[Warsaw Pact]] in May 1955, as societal dissatisfaction with the regime swelled. Following the firing on peaceful demonstrations by Soviet soldiers and secret police, and rallies throughout the country on 23 October 1956, protesters took to the streets in Budapest, initiating the [[Hungarian Revolution of 1956|1956 Revolution]]. In an effort to quell the chaos, Nagy returned as premier, promised free elections, and took Hungary out of the Warsaw Pact.

The violence nonetheless continued as revolutionary militias sprung up against the Soviet Army and the ÁVH; the roughly 3,000-strong resistance fought Soviet tanks using [[Molotov cocktail]]s and machine-pistols. Though the preponderance of the Soviets was immense, they suffered heavy losses, and by 30 October 1956, most Soviet troops had withdrawn from Budapest to garrison the countryside. For a time, the Soviet leadership was unsure how to respond to developments in Hungary but eventually decided to intervene to prevent a destabilization of the Soviet bloc. On 4 November, reinforcements of more than 150,000 troops and 2,500 tanks entered the country from the Soviet Union.<ref>Findley, Carter V., and John Rothney. ''Twentieth Century World''. sixth ed. Boston: Houghton Mifflin, 2006. 278.</ref> Nearly 20,000 Hungarians were killed resisting the intervention, while an additional 21,600 were imprisoned afterwards for political reasons. Some 13,000 were interned and 230 brought to trial and executed. Nagy was secretly tried, found guilty, sentenced to death and executed by hanging in June 1958. Because borders were briefly opened, nearly a quarter of a million people fled the country by the time the revolution was suppressed.<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/business/6065398.stm "Hungary's 1956 brain drain"], BBC News, 23 October 2006</ref>

==== Kádár era (1956–1988) ====
{{See also|Goulash Communism}}
[[File:János Kádár 1962.jpg|thumb|upright|[[János Kádár]], General Secretary of MSZMP, the [[Hungarian Socialist Workers' Party]] (1956–1988)]]

After a second, briefer period of Soviet military occupation, [[János Kádár]], Nagy's former Minister of State, was chosen by the Soviet leadership to head the new government and chair the new ruling [[Hungarian Socialist Workers' Party|Socialist Workers' Party]] (MSzMP). Kádár quickly normalized the situation. In 1963, the government granted a general amnesty and released the majority of those imprisoned for their active participation in the uprising. Kádár proclaimed a new policy line, according to which the people were no longer compelled to profess loyalty to the party if they tacitly accepted the Socialist regime as a fact of life. In many speeches, he described this as, "Those who are not against us are with us." Kádár introduced new planning priorities in the economy, such as allowing farmers significant plots of private land within the collective farm system (''háztáji gazdálkodás''). The living standard rose as consumer good and food production took precedence over military production, which was reduced to one-tenth of pre-revolutionary levels.

In 1968, the [[New Economic Mechanism]] (NEM) introduced free-market elements into socialist command economy. From the 1960s through the late 1980s, Hungary was often referred to as "[[the happiest barrack]]" within the [[Eastern bloc]]. During the latter part of the Cold War Hungary's [[GDP per capita]] was fourth only to [[East Germany]], [[Czechoslovak Socialist Republic|Czechoslovakia]], and the Soviet Union itself.<ref name="madison185">*{{Cite book|last=Maddison|first=Angus |title=The world economy|publisher=OECD Publishing|year=2006|isbn=978-92-64-02261-4|page=185}}</ref> As a result of this relatively high standard of living, a more liberalized economy, a less censored press, and less restricted travel rights, Hungary was generally considered one of the more liberal countries in which to live in Central Europe during communism. In the 1980s, however, living standards steeply declined again due to [[Early 1980s recession|a worldwide recession]] to which communism was unable to respond.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Watkins|first1=Theyer|title=Economic History and the Economy of Hungary|url=http://www.sjsu.edu/faculty/watkins/hungary.htm|website=sjsu.edu|publisher=San José State University Department of Economics|access-date=6 August 2014}}</ref> By the time Kádár died in 1989, the Soviet Union was in steep decline and a younger generation of reformists saw liberalization as the solution to economic and social issues.

=== Third Republic (1989–present) ===
{{See also|Revolutions of 1989|2006 protests in Hungary}}
[[File:Foundation of the Visegrád Group.tiff|thumb|The [[Visegrád Group]] signing ceremony in February 1991]]

Hungary's [[fall of communism|transition from communism]] to democracy and capitalism (''rendszerváltás'', "regime change") was peaceful and prompted by economic stagnation, domestic political pressure, and changing relations with other [[Warsaw Pact]] countries. Although the MSzMP began [[Hungarian Round Table Talks|Round Table Talks]] with various opposition groups in March 1989, the reburial of Imre Nagy as a revolutionary martyr that June is widely considered the symbolic end of communism in Hungary. Over 100,000 people attended the Budapest ceremony without any significant government interference, and many speakers openly called for Soviet troops to leave the country. Free elections were held [[1990 Hungarian parliamentary election|in May 1990]], and the [[Hungarian Democratic Forum]], a major conservative opposition group, was elected to the head of a coalition government. [[József Antall]] became the first democratically elected Prime Minister since World War II.

With the removal of state subsidies and rapid privatization in 1991, Hungary was affected by a severe economic recession. The Antall government's austerity measures proved unpopular, and the Communist Party's legal and political heir, the [[Hungarian Socialist Party|Socialist Party]], won the subsequent [[1994 Hungarian parliamentary election|1994 elections]]. This abrupt shift in the political landscape was repeated in [[1998 Hungarian parliamentary election|1998]] and [[2002 Hungarian parliamentary election|2002]]; each electoral cycle, the governing party was ousted and the erstwhile opposition elected. Like most other post-communist European states, however, Hungary broadly pursued an [[European integration|integrationist]] agenda, [[Enlargement of NATO|joining]] [[NATO]] in 1999 and the European Union [[2003 Hungarian European Union membership referendum|in 2004]]. As a NATO member, Hungary was involved in the [[Yugoslav Wars]].

In 2006, [[2006 protests in Hungary|major protests]] erupted after it was revealed that Prime Minister [[Ferenc Gyurcsány]] had claimed in [[Őszöd speech|a private speech]] that [[Hungarian Socialist Party|his party]] "lied" to win the [[2006 Hungarian parliamentary election|recent elections]]. The popularity of left-wing parties plummeted in the ensuing political upheaval, and in 2010, [[Viktor Orbán]]'s [[national conservatism|national-conservative]] [[Fidesz]] was [[2010 Hungarian parliamentary election|elected]] to a parliamentary [[supermajority]]. The legislature consequently approved a [[Constitution of Hungary|new constitution]], among other sweeping governmental and legal changes. Although these developments were met with and still engender controversy, Fidesz secured a second parliamentary supermajority [[2014 Hungarian parliamentary election|in 2014]] and a third [[2018 Hungarian parliamentary election|in 2018]].<ref>Krekó, Péter and Juhász, Attila, ''The Hungarian Far Right: Social Demand, Political Supply, and International Context'' (Stuttgart: ibidem Verlag, 2017), {{ISBN|978-3-8382-1184-8}}. [https://www.h-net.org/reviews/showrev.php?id=52361 online review]</ref>

In September 2018, the European parliament voted to act against Hungary, under the terms of [[Article 7 of the Treaty on European Union]]. Proponents of the vote claimed that the Hungarian government posed a [[Democratic backsliding|"systematic threat" to democracy]] and the rule of law. The vote was carried with the support of 448 MEPs, narrowly clearing the two-thirds majority required. The vote marked the first the European parliament had triggered an article 7 procedure against an EU member state. [[Péter Szijjártó]], the [[Minister of Foreign Affairs (Hungary)|Hungarian foreign minister]], described the vote as "petty revenge" which had been provoked by Hungary's tough anti-migration policies. Szijjártó alleged that the vote was fraudulent because abstentions were not counted which made it easier to reach the two-thirds majority required to pass the vote.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/sep/12/eu-meps-vote-to-pursue-action-against-hungary-over-orban-crackdown|title=MEPs vote to pursue action against Hungary over Orbán crackdown|last=Rankin|first=Jennifer|date=12 September 2018|website=the Guardian|language=en-GB|access-date=24 September 2018}}</ref>

== Geography ==
{{Main|Geography of Hungary}}
{{See also|List of national parks of Hungary}}
[[File:Magyar racka juh.jpg|thumb|A flock of [[Racka]] sheep in the [[Fertő-Hanság National Park]]]]

Hungary's geography has traditionally been defined by its two main waterways, the [[Danube]] and [[Tisza]] rivers. The common tripartite division of the country into three sections—''Dunántúl'' ("beyond the Danube", [[Transdanubia]]), ''[[Tiszántúl]]'' ("beyond the Tisza"), and ''Duna-Tisza köze'' ("between the Danube and Tisza")—is a reflection of this. The Danube flows north–south right through the centre of contemporary Hungary, and the entire country lies within its [[drainage basin]].

[[Transdanubia]], which stretches westward from the centre of the country towards Austria, is a primarily hilly region with a terrain varied by low mountains. These include the very eastern stretch of the [[Alps]], ''[[Alpokalja]]'', in the west of the country, the [[Transdanubian Mountains]] in the central region of Transdanubia, and the [[Mecsek]] Mountains and [[Villány Mountains]] in the south. The highest point of the area is the Írott-kő in the Alps, at {{convert|882|m|0}}. The [[Little Hungarian Plain]] (''Kisalföld'') is found in northern Transdanubia. [[Lake Balaton]] and [[Lake Hévíz]], the largest lake in Central Europe and the largest thermal lake in the world, respectively, are in Transdanubia as well.

The ''Duna-Tisza köze'' and ''Tiszántúl'' are characterised mainly by the [[Great Hungarian Plain]] (''Alföld''), which stretches across most of the eastern and southeastern areas of the country. To the north of the Plain are the foothills of the [[Carpathian Mountains|Carpathians]] in a wide band near the [[Slovakia]]n border. The [[Kékes]] at {{convert|1014|m|ft|0|abbr=on|disp=or}} is the tallest mountain in Hungary and is found here.

[[Phytogeography|Phytogeographically]], Hungary belongs to the Central European province of the [[Circumboreal Region]] within the [[Boreal Kingdom]]. According to the [[World Wide Fund for Nature|WWF]], the territory of Hungary belongs to the terrestrial ecoregion of [[Pannonian mixed forests]].<ref name="DinersteinOlson2017">{{cite journal|last1=Dinerstein|first1=Eric|last2=Olson|first2=David|last3=Joshi|first3=Anup|last4=Vynne|first4=Carly|last5=Burgess|first5=Neil D.|last6=Wikramanayake|first6=Eric|last7=Hahn|first7=Nathan|last8=Palminteri|first8=Suzanne|last9=Hedao|first9=Prashant|last10=Noss|first10=Reed|last11=Hansen|first11=Matt|last12=Locke|first12=Harvey|last13=Ellis|first13=Erle C|last14=Jones|first14=Benjamin|last15=Barber|first15=Charles Victor|last16=Hayes|first16=Randy|last17=Kormos|first17=Cyril|last18=Martin|first18=Vance|last19=Crist|first19=Eileen|last20=Sechrest|first20=Wes|last21=Price|first21=Lori|last22=Baillie|first22=Jonathan E.

The following section is not cited, and "according to popular opinion" possibly not encyclopedic in content. Until someone looks after this, please keep it hidden:

The relative isolation of the Carpathian Basin makes it susceptible to droughts and the [[effects of global warming]] have already been felt. According to popular opinion and many scientists, the country became drier in recent decades, as droughts have become quite common. Summers became hotter and winters became milder. For these reasons, snow has become much rarer than before. Popular opinion also states that the four-season system became a two-season system as spring and autumn are getting shorter and shorter, even vanishing some years. This supposed tendency unexpectedly was reversed in 2006 when Hungary's two main rivers, the [[Danube]] and the [[Tisza]], flooded at the same time. It made hundreds of homes uninhabitable despite the hard work of the defenders who reinforced most sections of the rivers with sandbags (with the help of university students and the army of Hungary ("Honvédség")).

Most of Hungary is covered by agricultural plains; there are but few remnants of its original forests, mainly in the mountain regions and national parks. -->

Hungary is a [[Unitary state|unitary]], [[parliamentary democratic|parliamentary]], [[representative democracy|representative democratic]] [[parliamentary republic|republic]]. The Hungarian political system operates under a framework reformed in 2012; this constitutional document is the [[Constitution of Hungary|Fundamental Law of Hungary]]. Amendments generally require a two-thirds majority of parliament; the fundamental principles of the constitution (as expressed in the articles guaranteeing human dignity, the separation of powers, the state structure, and the [[rule of law]]) are valid in perpetuity. 199 Members of Parliament (''országgyűlési képviselő'') are elected to the highest organ of state authority, the [[Unicameralism|unicameral]] ''[[National Assembly of Hungary|Országgyűlés]]'' (National Assembly), every four years in a single-round [[first-past-the-post voting|first-past-the-post]] election with an [[election threshold]] of 5%.

The [[President of Hungary|President of the Republic]] (''köztársasági elnök'') serves as the [[head of state]] and is elected by the National Assembly every five years. The president is invested primarily with representative responsibilities and powers: receiving foreign heads of state, formally nominating the Prime Minister at the recommendation of the National Assembly, and serving as [[Commander-in-chief]] of the [[Hungarian Army|armed forces]]. Importantly, the president is also invested with [[veto power]], and may send legislation to the 15-member [[Constitutional Court of Hungary|Constitutional Court]] for review. The third most-significant governmental position in Hungary is the [[List of Speakers of the National Assembly (Hungary)|Speaker of the National Assembly]], who is elected by the National Assembly and responsible for overseeing the daily sessions of the body.

The [[Prime Minister of Hungary|Prime Minister]] (''miniszterelnök'') is elected by the National Assembly, serving as the [[head of government]] and exercising [[Executive (government)|executive power]]. Traditionally, the Prime Minister is the leader of the largest party in parliament. The Prime Minister selects [[Government of Hungary|Cabinet]] ministers and has the exclusive right to dismiss them, although cabinet nominees must appear before consultative open hearings before one or more parliamentary [[committee]]s, survive a vote in the National Assembly, and be formally approved by the president. The cabinet reports to [[National Assembly (Hungary)|parliament]].

Following a decade of [[Fidesz]]-[[KDNP]] rule lead by [[Viktor Orbán]], [[Freedom House]]'s ''Nations in Transit 2020'' report reclassified Hungary from a [[democracy]] to a transitional or [[hybrid regime]]. According to the report, "the right-wing alliance... has gradually undermined the rule of law in Hungary and established tight control over the country’s independent institutions... [it] has steadily rewritten the Hungarian constitution, and eliminated democratic safeguards statutorily embodied in the Constitutional Court, Prosecutors Office, Media Authority, and State Audit Office...". It also limited parliamentary oversight, independent [[News media|media]], [[non-governmental organization]]s and [[academic freedom|academic]]s, while consolidating power around the central government.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Hungary |url=https://freedomhouse.org/country/hungary/nations-transit/2020 |date=2020 |website=Freedom House |language=en |access-date=6 May 2020}}</ref>

The democratic character of the Hungarian parliament was reestablished with [[revolutions of 1989|the fall of the Iron Curtain]] and the end of communist dictatorship in 1989.

The articles of the 1790 diet set out that the diet should meet at least once every 3 years, but, since the diet was called by the [[Habsburg monarchy]], this promise was not kept on several occasions thereafter. As a result of the [[Austro-Hungarian Compromise of 1867|Austro-Hungarian Compromise]], it was reconstituted in 1867.

Law enforcement in Hungary is split among the [[Rendőrség|police]] and the National Tax and Customs Administration. The Hungarian Police is the main and largest state [[law enforcement agency]] in Hungary. It carries nearly all general police duties such as criminal investigation, patrol activity, traffic policing, border control. It is led by the National Police Commissioner under the control of the [[Ministry of Interior (Hungary)|Minister of the Interior]]. The body is divided into county police departments which are also divided into regional and town police departments. The National Police also have subordinate agencies with nationwide jurisdiction, such as the "Nemzeti Nyomozó Iroda" (National Bureau of Investigation), a civilian police force specialised in investigating serious crimes, and the gendarmerie-like, militarised "Készenléti Rendőrség" (Stand-by Police) mainly dealing with riots and often reinforcing local police forces. Due to Hungary's accession to the [[Schengen Treaty]], the Police and Border Guards were merged into a single national corps, with the Border Guards becoming Police Officers. This merger took place in January 2008. The Customs and Excise Authority remained subject to the Ministry of Finance under the National Tax and Customs Administration.<ref>Interpol [https://web.archive.org/web/20040621161237/http://www.interpol.int/Public/Region/Europe/pjsystems/Hungary.asp#21 entry] Retrieved 15 May 2007.</ref>

=== Administrative divisions ===
{{Main|Administrative divisions of Hungary}}
Hungary is a [[unitary state|unitary state nation]] divided into 19 [[Counties of Hungary|counties]] (''megye''). In addition, the [[Capitals of Hungary|capital]] (''főváros''), [[Budapest]], is an independent entity. The counties and the capital are the 20 [[Nomenclature of Territorial Units for Statistics|NUTS]] third-level units of Hungary. The states are further subdivided into 174 [[Districts of Hungary|districts]] (''járás'') {{as of|2013|January|1|lc=y}}.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.kozlonyok.hu/nkonline/MKPDF/hiteles/MK14170.pdf|title=Magyar Közlöny, Hungary's Official Journal|publisher=Magyar Közlöny|date=20 November 2016 |access-date=20 November 2016}}</ref> The districts are further divided into [[List of cities and towns of Hungary|towns and villages]], of which 23 are designated [[Town with county rights|towns with county rights]] (''megyei jogú város''), sometimes known as "urban counties" in English. The local authorities of these towns have extended powers, but these towns belong to the territory of the respective district instead of being independent territorial units. County and district councils and municipalities have different roles and separate responsibilities relating to local government. The role of the counties are basically administrative and focus on strategic development, while preschools, public water utilities, garbage disposal, elderly care and rescue services are administered by the municipalities.

Since 1996, the counties and City of Budapest have been grouped into seven [[Regions of Hungary|regions]] for statistical and development purposes. These seven regions constitute [[Nomenclature of Territorial Units for Statistics|NUTS]]' second-level units of Hungary. They are [[Central Hungary]], [[Central Transdanubia]], [[Northern Great Plain]], [[Northern Hungary]], [[Southern Transdanubia]], [[Southern Great Plain]], and [[Western Transdanubia]].

The [[foreign policy]] of Hungary is based on four basic commitments: to [[atlanticism|Atlantic co-operation]], to [[European integration]], to [[international development]] and to [[international law]].{{citation needed|date=May 2020}} The [[Economy of Hungary|Hungarian economy]] is fairly open{{clarify|date=January 2021}} and relies strongly on [[international trade]].{{citation needed|date=May 2020}}

Hungary has been a member of the [[United Nations]] since December 1955 and a member of the [[European Union]], [[NATO]], the [[Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development|OECD]], the [[Visegrád Group]], the [[WTO]], the [[World Bank]], the [[Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank|AIIB]] and the [[International Monetary Fund|IMF]]. Hungary took on the presidency of the [[Council of the European Union]] for half a year in 2011 and the next will be in 2024. In 2015, Hungary was the fifth largest [[OECD]] Non-DAC donor of [[development aid]] in the world, which represents [[List of development aid country donors|0.13% of its Gross National Income]].

Hungary's capital city, Budapest, is home to more than 100 embassies and representative bodies as an international political actor.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.kulugyminiszterium.hu/dtwebe/Irodak.aspx|title=Embassies in Budapest|year=2014|publisher=Kulugyminiszterium.hu|access-date=16 April 2020}}</ref> Hungary hosts the main and regional headquarters of many international organisations as well, including [[European Institute of Innovation and Technology]], [[European Police College]], [[United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees]], [[Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations]], [[International Centre for Democratic Transition]], [[Institute of International Education]], [[International Labour Organization]], [[International Organization for Migration]], [[International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies|International Red Cross]], [[Regional Environmental Center for Central and Eastern Europe]], [[Danube Commission (1948)|Danube Commission]] and others.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mfa.gov.hu/kum2005/Templates/alapsablon.aspx?NRMODE=Published&NRORIGINALURL=%2Fkum%2Fen%2Fbal%2Fforeign_policy%2Fun_sc%2Finternational_organisations.htm&NRNODEGUID=%7B45550E06-66FE-4183-A899-EDF5BD040EB5%7D&NRCACHEHINT=NoModifyGuest&printable=true|title=International organizations in Hungary|publisher=Ministry of Foreign Affairs|access-date=20 November 2016}}</ref>

Since 1989, Hungary's top foreign policy goal has been achieving integration into Western economic and security organisations. Hungary joined the [[Partnership for Peace]] programme in 1994 and has actively supported the [[IFOR]] and [[SFOR]] missions in Bosnia. Hungary since 1989 has also improved its often frosty neighbourly relations by signing basic treaties with [[Romania]], [[Slovakia]], and [[Ukraine]]. These renounce all outstanding territorial claims and lay the foundation for constructive relations. However, the issue of [[Hungarian diaspora|ethnic Hungarian minority]] rights in Romania, Slovakia and Serbia periodically causes bilateral tensions to flare up. Since 2017, the [[Hungary–Ukraine relations|relations with Ukraine]] rapidly deteriorated over the issue of the [[Hungarians in Ukraine|Hungarian minority in Ukraine]].<ref>"[https://www.neweurope.eu/article/hungary-ukraine-relations-hit-new-low-troop-deployment/ Hungary-Ukraine relations hit new low over troop deployment]". ''[[New Europe (newspaper)|New Europe]]''. 26 March 2018.</ref> Hungary since 1989 has signed all of the [[Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe|OSCE]] documents, and served as the OSCE's Chairman-in-Office in 1997.

=== Military ===
{{Main|Hungarian Defence Force}}

The [[List of heads of state of Hungary|President]] holds the title of [[commander-in-chief]] of the nation's armed forces. The [[Minister of Defence (Hungary)|Ministry of Defence]] jointly with [[General Staff of the Armed Forces of the Republic of Hungary|Chief of staff]] administers the armed forces, including the [[Hungarian Ground Force]] and the [[Hungarian Air Force]]. Since 2007, the Hungarian Armed Forces has been under a unified command structure. The Ministry of Defence maintains the political and civil control over the army. A subordinate Joint Forces Command coordinates and commands the HDF. In 2016, the armed forces had 31,080 personnel on active duty, the operative reserve brought the total number of troops to fifty thousand. In 2016, it was planned that military spending the following year would be $1.21&nbsp;billion, about 0.94% of the country's GDP, well below the NATO target of 2%. In 2012, the government adopted a resolution in which it pledged to increase defence spending to 1.4% of GDP by 2022.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://hungarytoday.hu/news/budget-2017-hungary-spend-e3-7-billion-revenues-next-year-95159|title=Budget 2017: Hungary to spend €3.7 billion more than it should next year|publisher=hungarytoday.hu|access-date=28 April 2016|date=28 April 2016}}</ref>

[[Military service]] is voluntary, though [[conscription]] may occur in wartime. In a significant move for modernisation, Hungary decided in 2001 to buy 14 [[JAS 39 Gripen]] fighter aircraft for about 800&nbsp;million EUR. Hungarian National Cyber Security Center was re-organised in 2016 in order to become more efficient through [[cyber security]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.enisa.europa.eu/about-enisa/structure-organization/national-liaison-office/meetings/june-2016/revised-hungarian-it-security-policy|title=Revised Hungarian IT Security Policy|publisher=National Cyber Security Center|access-date=20 November 2016}}</ref>

In 2016, the Hungarian military had about 700 troops stationed in foreign countries as part of international peacekeeping forces, including 100 HDF troops in the [[NATO]]-led [[ISAF]] force in [[Afghanistan]], 210 Hungarian soldiers in [[Kosovo]] under command of [[Kosovo Force|KFOR]], and 160 troops in [[Bosnia and Herzegovina]]. Hungary sent a 300-strong logistics unit to Iraq in order to help the US occupation with armed transport convoys, though public opinion opposed the country's participation in the war. One soldier was [[killed in action]] by a roadside bomb while serving in Iraq.{{Citation needed|date=August 2020}}

In 1872, the [[Ludovica Military Academy]] officially began training cadets. By 1873, the Hungarian military consisted of over 2,800 officers and 158,000 men organised into eighty-six infantry battalions and fifty-eight mounted squadrons. During World War I, out of the eight million men mobilized by [[Austro Hungarian Empire]], over one million died. During the 1930s and early 1940s, Hungary was preoccupied with regaining the territories and population lost as a result of the [[Trianon peace treaty]] at Versailles in 1920. Conscription was introduced on a national basis in 1939. The peacetime strength of the [[Royal Hungarian Army]] grew to 80,000 men organised into seven corps commands.<ref>Page 207, Mollo, Andrew, ''The Armed Forces of World War II'', Crown, 1981, New York, {{ISBN|0-517-54478-4}}</ref> During World War II, the [[Hungarian Second Army]] was heavily depleted fighting on the banks of the [[Don River (Russia)|Don River]] in December 1942 during the [[Battle for Stalingrad]].

=== Transport ===
{{Main|Transport in Hungary}}
[[File:Esztergom.desiro.JPG|thumb|left|[[Siemens Desiro]] on [[Hungarian State Railways]] network, which is [[List of countries by rail transport network size|one of the densest in the world]]]]
Hungary has a highly developed road, railway, air and water transport system. Budapest, the capital, serves as an important hub for the [[Hungarian State Railways|Hungarian railway system]] (''MÁV''). The capital is served by three large train stations called ''[[Eastern Railway Station (Budapest)|Keleti]]'' (Eastern), ''[[Western Railway Station (Budapest)|Nyugati]]'' (Western), and ''[[Southern Railway Station (Budapest)|Déli]]'' (Southern) ''pályaudvar''s. [[Szolnok]] is the most important railway hub outside Budapest, while [[Tiszai Railway Station]] in [[Miskolc]] and the main stations of [[Szombathely]], [[Győr]], [[Szeged]], and [[Székesfehérvár]] are also key to the network.

Budapest, [[Debrecen]], [[Miskolc]], and [[Szeged]] have tram networks. The [[Budapest Metro]] is the second-oldest underground [[rapid transit|metro]] system in the world; its [[Line 1 (Budapest Metro)|Line 1]] dates from 1896. The system consists of four lines. A [[regional rail|commuter rail]] system, ''[[HÉV]]'', operates in the Budapest metropolitan area.
Hungary has a total length of approximately {{convert|1314|km|2|abbr=on}} motorways ({{lang-hu|autópálya}}). Motorway sections are being added to the existing network, which already connects many major economically important cities to the capital.
The most important port is Budapest. Other important ones include [[Dunaújváros]] and [[Baja, Hungary|Baja]].

There are five international airports in Hungary: [[Budapest Liszt Ferenc International Airport|Budapest Liszt Ferenc]] (informally called "Ferihegy" after its previous name), [[Debrecen International Airport|Debrecen]], [[Sármellék International Airport|Sármellék]] (also called Hévíz-Balaton Airport), [[Győr-Pér International Airport|Győr-Pér]], and [[Pécs-Pogány International Airport|Pécs-Pogány]]. The national carrier, [[Malév Hungarian Airlines|MALÉV]], operated flights to over 60, mostly European cities, but ceased operations in 2012. Low-budget airline [[WizzAir]] is based in Hungary, at Ferihegy.

[[File:Population density in Hungary.png|upright=1.3|thumb|Population density in Hungary by [[Districts of Hungary|district]].]]
Hungary's population was 9,937,628 according to the 2011 [[census]], making it the fifth most populous country in [[Central and Eastern Europe]] and [[Demographics of the European Union|medium-sized member state of the European Union]]. [[Population density]] stands at 107 inhabitants per square kilometre, which is about two times higher than the [[List of sovereign states and dependent territories by population density|world average]].

Hungary recognises two sizeable minority groups, designated as "national minorities" because their ancestors have lived in their respective regions for centuries in Hungary: a [[Germans of Hungary|German community]] of about 130,000 that lives throughout the country, and a [[Romani people in Hungary|Romani minority]] numerous around 300,000 that mainly resides in [[Northern Hungary|the northern part of the country]].

{{Largest cities of Hungary}}

[[File:Hungary local administration.png|thumb|upright=1.3|Towns and villages in Hungary]]

Hungary has 3,152 localities as of July 15, 2013. 346 towns (Hungarian term: ''város'', plural: ''városok''; the terminology doesn't distinguish between [[city|cities]] and [[town]]s – the term town is used in official translations) and 2,806 villages (Hungarian: ''község'', plural: ''községek''). The number of towns can change, since villages can be elevated to town status by act of the President. The capital Budapest has a special status and is not included in any county while 23 of the towns are so-called urban counties (''megyei jogú város'' – town with county rights). All county seats except Budapest are urban counties.

Four of the cities ([[Budapest]], [[Miskolc]], [[Győr]], and [[Pécs]]) have agglomerations, and the Hungarian Statistical Office distinguishes seventeen other areas in earlier stages of agglomeration development.<ref name="portal">{{cite web|url=http://portal.ksh.hu/portal/page?_pageid=37,412178&_dad=portal&_schema=PORTAL#sett|website=portal.ksh.hu|title=portal.ksh.hu/portal/page?_pageid=37,412178&_dad=portal&_schema=PORTAL#sett|access-date=23 January 2021}}</ref>

The largest city is the capital, Budapest, the smallest town is [[Pálháza]] with 1038 inhabitants (2010). The largest village is [[Solymár]] (population: 10,123 as of 2010) There are more than 100 villages with fewer than 100 inhabitants while the smallest villages have fewer than 20 inhabitants.

Hungarian (Magyar) is a member of the [[Uralic languages|Uralic language family]], unrelated to any neighbouring language and distantly related to [[Finnish language|Finnish]] and [[Estonian language|Estonian]]. It is the largest of the Uralic languages in terms of the number of speakers and the only one spoken in [[Central Europe]]. There are sizeable populations of Hungarian speakers in Romania, the Czech and Slovak Republics, the former Yugoslavia, Ukraine, Israel, and the U.S. Smaller groups of Hungarian speakers live in Canada, Slovenia, and Austria, but also in Australia, Brazil, Argentina, Mexico, Venezuela and Chile. Standard Hungarian is based on the variety spoken in the capital of [[Budapest]], although use of the standard dialect is enforced, Hungarian has a number of urban and rural [[dialect]]s.

=== Religion ===
{{Main|Religion in Hungary}}

Hungary is a historically [[Christianity|Christian]] country. Hungarian historiography identifies the foundation of the Hungarian state with [[Stephen I of Hungary|Stephen I's]] [[baptism]] and coronation with the [[Szentkorona|Holy Crown]] in A.D. 1000. Stephen promulgated [[Roman Catholicism]] as the state religion, and his successors were traditionally known as the [[Apostolic King]]s. The [[Catholic Church in Hungary]] remained strong through the centuries, and the [[Archbishop of Esztergom]] was granted extraordinary temporal privileges as [[prince-primate]] (''hercegprímás'') of Hungary.

[[File:Benczúr - Painting of St Stephen in the Basilica of Budapest.jpg|thumb|left|[[Stephen I of Hungary|King Saint Stephen]] offering the Hungarian crown to [[Mary, mother of Jesus|Virgin Mary]] - painting by Gyula Benczúr, in the St. Stephen's Basilica]]

Although contemporary Hungary has no [[official religion]] and recognises [[freedom of religion]] as a fundamental right, the Hungarian constitution "recognizes Christianity's nation-building role" in its preamble<ref>{{cite web|title=Magyarország Alaptörvénye|url=http://www.parlament.hu/irom39/02627/02627.pdf|website=Parlament.hu|publisher=Hungarian Parliament|access-date=2 August 2014}}</ref> and in Article VII affirms that "the state may cooperate with the churches for community goals."<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.constituteproject.org/constitution/Hungary_2011.pdf|title=Hungary's Constitution of 2011}}</ref>

The 2011 census showed that the majority of Hungarians were Christians (54.2%), with [[Catholic Church in Hungary|Roman Catholics]] (''Katolikusok'') (37.1%) and [[Hungarian Reformed]] [[Calvinist]]s (''Reformátusok'') (11.1%) making up the bulk of these alongside [[Lutheran]]s (''Evangélikusok'') (2.2%), [[Greek Catholic]]s (1.8%), and other Christians (1.3%). [[Jewish]] (0.1%), [[Buddhist]] (0.1%) and [[Muslim]] (0.06%) communities are in the minority. 27.2% of the population did not declare a religious affiliation while 16.7% declared themselves explicitly [[irreligious]], another 1.5% [[atheist]].<ref name="Census2011det" />

During the initial stages of the [[Protestant Reformation]], most Hungarians adopted first [[Lutheranism]] and then [[Calvinism]] in the form of the [[Hungarian Reformed Church]]. In the second half of the 16th century, the [[Jesuits]] led a [[Counterreformation]] campaign and the population once again became predominantly Catholic. This campaign was only partially successful, however, and the (mainly Reformed) Hungarian nobility were able to secure freedom of worship for Christians. In practice this meant ''[[cuius regio, eius religio]]''; thus, most individual localities in Hungary are still identifiable as historically Catholic, Lutheran, or Reformed. The country's eastern regions, especially around [[Debrecen]] (the "Calvinist Rome"), remain almost completely [[Reformed]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.reformatus.hu/mutat/6819/ |title=Facts and Statistics |publisher=Reformatus.hu |date=4 March 2013 |access-date=26 March 2013}}</ref> a trait they share with historically contiguous [[Hungarians in Romania|ethnically Hungarian regions]] across the Romanian border.

[[Eastern Orthodox Church|Orthodox Christianity]] in Hungary is associated with the country's ethnic minorities: [[Armenians]], [[Bulgarians]], [[Greeks]], [[Romanians]], [[Rusyns]], [[Ukrainians]], and [[Serbs]].

Historically, Hungary was home to a [[History of the Jews in Hungary|significant Jewish community]] with a pre-[[World War II]] population of more than 800,000, but it is estimated that just over 564,000 Hungarian Jews were killed between 1941 and 1945 during [[the Holocaust in Hungary]].<ref>{{cite book |last1=Braham |first1=Randolph L. |author-link1=Randolph L.

Some Jews were able to escape, but most were either deported to concentration camps, where they were killed, or murdered in Hungary by [[Arrow Cross Party|Arrow Cross]] members.

[[Preschool]]-[[kindergarten]] education is [[compulsory education|compulsory]] and provided for all children between three and six years old, after which school attendance is also [[compulsory education|compulsory]] until the age of sixteen.<ref name="europa"/> [[Primary education]] usually lasts for eight years. [[Secondary education]] includes three traditional types of schools focused on different academic levels: the [[Gymnasium (school)|Gymnasium]] enrolls the most gifted children and prepares students for university studies; the secondary vocational schools for intermediate students lasts four years and the technical school prepares pupils for [[vocational training|vocational education]] and the world of work. The system is partly flexible and bridges exist, graduates from a vocational school can achieve a two years programme to have access to vocational higher education for instance.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.unevoc.unesco.org/worldtvetdatabase1.php?ct=HUN | title=Vocational Education in Hungary | date=October 2013 | access-date=19 May 2014 | author=UNESCO-UNEVOC}}</ref> The [[Trends in International Mathematics and Science Study]] (TIMSS) rated 13–14-year-old pupils in Hungary among the bests in the world for maths and science.

Most of the [[List of universities in Hungary|Hungarian universities]] are [[public university|public institutions]], and students traditionally study without fee payment. The general requirement for university is the [[Matura]]. The Hungarian public [[higher education]] system includes universities and other higher education institutes, that provide both education curricula and related degrees up to doctoral degree and also contribute to research activities. Health insurance for students is free until the end of their studies. English and German language is important in Hungarian higher education, there are a number of degree programmes that are taught in these languages, which attracts thousands of [[Student exchange program|exchange students]] every year. Hungary's higher education and training has been ranked 44 out of 148 countries in the Global Competitiveness Report 2014.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www3.weforum.org/docs/WEF_GlobalCompetitivenessReport_2013-14.pdf |title=Global Competitiveness Record 2013/2014 |access-date=19 May 2014 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110604005151/http://www.forbes.com/feeds/afx/2007/06/12/afx3810988.html |archive-date=4 June 2011 }}</ref>

Hungary has a long tradition of higher education reflecting the existence of established [[knowledge economy]]. The established [[List of universities in Hungary|universities in Hungary]] include some of the [[List of oldest universities in continuous operation|oldest in the world]], the first was the [[University of Pécs]] founded in 1367 which is still functioning, although, in the year 1276, the university of [[Veszprém]] was destroyed by the troops of [[Peter I Csák|Peter Csák]], but it was never rebuilt. [[Sigismund]] established [[Óbuda University]] in 1395. Another, [[Universitas Istropolitana]], was established 1465 in [[Pozsony]] by [[Mattias Corvinus]].
[[Nagyszombat]] University was founded in 1635 and moved to Buda in 1777 and it is called [[Eötvös Loránd University]] today. The world's first [[institute of technology]] was founded in [[Selmecbánya]], Kingdom of Hungary in 1735, its legal successor is the [[University of Miskolc]]. The [[Budapest University of Technology and Economics]] is considered the oldest institute of technology in the world with university rank and structure, its legal predecessor the Institutum Geometrico-Hydrotechnicum was founded in 1782 by [[Joseph II, Holy Roman Emperor|Emperor Joseph II]].

Hungary ranks fourth (above neighbour Romania, and after China, the United States and Russia) in the all-time medal count at the [[International Mathematical Olympiad]] with 336 total medals, dating back to 1959.

Hungary is home to the largest synagogue in Europe ([[Dohány Street Synagogue|Great Synagogue]]), built in 1859 in Moorish Revival style with a capacity of 3,000 people, the largest medicinal bath in Europe ([[Széchenyi Medicinal Bath]]), completed in 1913 in Modern Renaissance Style and located in the Budapest city park, the biggest building in Hungary with its {{convert|268|m|abbr=off}} length (the Parliament building), one of the largest basilicas in Europe ([[Esztergom Basilica]]), the second largest territorial abbey in the world ([[Pannonhalma Archabbey]]), and the largest early Christian necropolis outside Italy ([[Pécs]]).

[[File:Apátsági templom (8941. számú műemlék) 7.jpg|left|thumb|Romanesque [[Ják Abbey]], [[Vas County]], built between 1220 and 1256.]]

Notable architectural styles in Hungary include [[Historicism]] and [[Art Nouveau]], or rather several variants of Art Nouveau. In contrast to Historicism, Hungarian Art Nouveau is based on the national architectural characteristics. Taking the eastern origins of the Hungarians into account, [[Ödön Lechner]] (1845–1914), the most important figure in Hungarian Art Nouveau, was initially inspired by Indian and Syrian architecture, and later by traditional Hungarian decorative designs. In this way, he created an original synthesis of architectural styles. By applying them to three-dimensional architectural elements, he produced a version of Art Nouveau that was specific to Hungary.

Turning away from the style of Lechner, yet taking inspiration from his approach, the group of "Young People" (''Fiatalok''), which included [[Károly Kós]] and Dezsö Zrumeczky, were to use the characteristic structures and forms of traditional Hungarian architecture to achieve the same end.

[[File:Museum of Applied Arts (Budapest).jpg|thumb|The [[Museum of Applied Arts (Budapest)|Museum of Applied Arts]], an [[Art Nouveau]] building designed by [[Ödön Lechner]]]]

Besides the two principal styles, Budapest also displays local versions of trends originating from other European countries. The Sezession from [[Vienna]], the German [[Jugendstil]], Art Nouveau from Belgium and France, and the influence of English and Finnish architecture are all reflected in the buildings constructed at the turn of the 20th century. [[Béla Lajta]] initially adopted Lechner's style, subsequently drawing his inspiration from English and Finnish trends; after developing an interest in the [[Ancient Egypt|Egyptian]] style, he finally arrived at modern architecture. [[Aladár Árkay]] took almost the same route. [[István Medgyaszay]] developed his own style, which differed from Lechner's, using stylised traditional motifs to create decorative designs in concrete. In the sphere of applied arts, those chiefly responsible for promoting the spread of Art Nouveau were the School and Museum of Decorative Arts, which opened in 1896.

Foreigners have unexpectedly "discovered" that a significantly large portion of the citizens live in old and architecturally valuable buildings. In the [[Budapest]] downtown area almost all the buildings are about one hundred years old, with thick walls, high ceilings, and motifs on the front wall.<ref name="Eliznik.org.uk" /><ref>{{cite web|url=http://budapestcorner.com/index.php/flats/general-information|title=General information on various student flats and building types in Budapest|publisher=Budapest Corner|access-date=11 December 2010|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101214123942/http://budapestcorner.com/index.php/flats/general-information|archive-date=14 December 2010}}</ref>

=== Music ===
{{Main|Music of Hungary}}
[[File:Hungarian State Opera House(PDXdj).jpg|thumb|[[Hungarian State Opera House]] on [[Andrássy út]] (UNESCO World Heritage Site)]]
Hungarian music consists mainly of traditional [[Hungarian folk music]] and music by prominent composers such as [[Liszt]] and [[Bartók]], considered to be among the greatest Hungarian composers. Other renowned composers are [[Ernő Dohnányi|Dohnányi]], [[Franz Schmidt]], [[Zoltán Kodály]], [[Gabriel von Wayditch]], [[Rudolf Wagner-Régeny]], [[László Lajtha]], [[Franz Lehár]], [[Imre Kálmán]], [[Sándor Veress]] and [[Miklós Rózsa|Rózsa]]. Hungarian traditional music tends to have a strong [[dactyl (poetry)|dactylic]] rhythm, as the language is invariably stressed on the first syllable of each word.

Hungary has renowned composers of contemporary classical music, [[György Ligeti]], [[György Kurtág]], [[Peter Eötvös|Péter Eötvös]], [[Zoltán Kodály]] and [[Zoltán Jeney]] among them. One of the greatest Hungarian composers, [[Béla Bartók]], was also among the most significant musicians of the 20th century. His music was invigorated by the themes, modes, and rhythmic patterns of the Hungarian and neighbouring folk music traditions he studied, which he synthesised with influences from his contemporaries into his own distinctive style.<ref>[http://mek.oszk.hu/02100/02172/html/index.html Szabolcsi] Although the Hungarian upper class has long had cultural and political connections with the rest of Europe, leading to an influx of European musical ideas, the rural peasants maintained their own traditions such that by the end of the 19th century Hungarian composers could draw on rural peasant music to (re)create a Hungarian classical style. For example, [[Béla Bartók]] and [[Zoltán Kodály]], two of Hungary's most famous composers, are known for using folk themes in their own music.</ref>

Hungary has made many contributions to the fields of [[folk music|folk]], [[popular music|popular]] and [[european classical music|classical music]]. Hungarian folk music is a prominent part of the national identity and continues to play a major part in Hungarian music. Hungarian folk music has been significant in former country parts that belong&nbsp;– since the 1920 [[Treaty of Trianon]]&nbsp;– to neighbouring countries such as Romania, Slovakia, Poland and especially in southern Slovakia and [[Transylvania]]; both regions have significant numbers of Hungarians.
After the establishment of a music academy led by [[Ferenc Erkel]] and [[Franz Liszt]] Hungary produced an important number of art musicians:
* Pianists: [[Ernö von Dohnányi|Ernő von Dohnányi]], [[Ervin Nyiregyházi]], [[Andor Földes]], [[Tamás Vásáry]], [[György Sándor]], [[Géza Anda]], [[Annie Fischer]], [[György Cziffra]], [[Edward Kilenyi|Edward Kilényi]], [[Balint Vazsonyi|Bálint Vázsonyi]], [[András Schiff]], [[Zoltán Kocsis]], [[Dezső Ránki]], [[Jenő Jandó]] and others.
* Violists: [[Joseph Joachim]], [[Leopold Auer]], [[Jenő Hubay]], [[Jelly d'Arányi]], [[Joseph Szigeti]], [[Sándor Végh]], [[Emil Telmanyi]], [[Zathurecky|Ede Zathurecky]], [[Zsigmondy]], [[Franz von Vecsey]], [[Zoltán Székely]], [[Tibor Varga (violinist)|Tibor Varga]] and newcomers [[Antal Szalai]], [[Vilmos Szabadi]], [[Kristóf Baráti]] (b. 79) and others.
* Opera singers: [[Astrid Varnay]], [[József Simándy]], [[Júlia Várady]], [[Julia Hamari|Júlia Hamari]], [[Kolos Kováts]] (Bluebeard in Bartók's Bluebeard)
* Conductors: [[Eugene Ormandy]], [[George Szell]], [[Antal Doráti]], [[János Ferencsik]], [[Fritz Reiner]], [[sir Georg Solti]], [[István Kertész (conductor)|István Kertész]], [[Ferenc Fricsay]], [[Zoltán Rozsnyai]], [[Sándor Végh]], [[Arpad Joo|Árpád Joó]], [[Ádám Fischer]], [[Iván Fischer]], [[Péter Eötvös]], [[Zoltán Kocsis]], [[Tamás Vásáry]], [[Gilbert Varga]] and others
* String Quartets: [[Budapest Quartet]], [[Hungarian Quartet]], [[Végh Quartet]], [[Takács Quartet]], [[Kodály Quartet]], [[Éder Quartet]], [[Festetics Quartet]],

Broughton claims that Hungary's "infectious sound has been surprisingly influential on neighboring countries (thanks perhaps to the common Austro-Hungarian history) and it's not uncommon to hear Hungarian-sounding tunes in Romania, Slovakia and Poland".<ref>Szalipszki, p. 12<br />Refers to the country as "widely considered" to be a "home of music".</ref> It is also strong in the [[Szabolcs-Szatmár-Bereg|Szabolcs-Szatmár]] area and in the southwest part of [[Transdanubia]], near the border with Croatia. The [[Busójárás]] carnival in [[Mohács]] is a major Hungarian folk music event, formerly featuring the long-established and well-regarded [[Bogyiszló orchestra]].<ref name="Broughton">Broughton, pp. 159–167</ref>

Hungarian [[European classical music|classical music]] has long been an "experiment, made from Hungarian antecedents and on Hungarian soil, to create a conscious musical culture [using the] musical world of the folk song".<ref>Szabolcsi, ''The Specific Conditions of Hungarian Musical Development''<br />"Every experiment, made from Hungarian antecedents and on Hungarian soil, to create a conscious musical culture (music written by composers, as different from folk music), had instinctively or consciously striven to develop widely and universally the musical world of the folk song. Folk poetry and folk music were deeply embedded in the collective Hungarian people's culture, and this unity did not cease to be effective even when it was given from and expression by individual creative artists, performers and poets."</ref> Although the Hungarian upper class has long had cultural and political connections with the rest of Europe, leading to an influx of European musical ideas, the rural peasants maintained their own traditions such that by the end of the 19th century Hungarian composers could draw on rural peasant music to (re)create a Hungarian classical style.<ref name="Szabolcsi">{{cite web|url=http://mek.oszk.hu/02100/02172/html/index.html |title=Szabolcsi |publisher=Mek.oszk.hu |access-date=20 September 2009}}</ref> For example, Bartók collected folk songs from across Central and Eastern Europe, including Romania and Slovakia, while Kodály was more interested in creating a distinctively Hungarian musical style.

During the era of communist rule in Hungary (1944–1989), a Song Committee scoured and censored popular music for traces of subversion and ideological impurity. Since then, however, the Hungarian music industry has begun to recover, producing successful performers in the fields of [[jazz]] such as trumpeter [[Rudolf Tomsits]], pianist-composer [[Károly Binder]] and, in a modernised form of Hungarian folk, [[Ferenc Sebő]] and [[Márta Sebestyén]]. The three giants of Hungarian rock, [[Illés (band)|Illés]], [[Metró (band)|Metró]] and [[Omega (band)|Omega]], remain very popular, especially Omega, which has followings in Germany and beyond as well as in Hungary. Older veteran underground bands such as [[Beatrice (band)|Beatrice]], from the 1980s, also remain popular.

{{Main|Hungarian literature}}
[[File:Szekely Hungarian Rovas alphabet Szekely magyar rovas ABC.svg|thumb|upright=1.75|left|The alphabet of the [[Old Hungarian script|Székely-Hungarian Rovás script]]; the country switched to using the Latin alphabet under king [[Stephen I of Hungary|Saint Stephen]] (reign: 1000–1038)]]
In the earliest times, [[Hungarian language]] was written in a [[Old Hungarian script|runic-like script]] (although it was not used for literature purposes in the modern interpretation). The country switched to the [[Latin alphabet]] after being Christianized under the reign of [[Stephen I of Hungary]] (1000–1038).<br />
The oldest remained written record in Hungarian language is a fragment in the [[Establishing charter of the abbey of Tihany]] (1055) which contains several Hungarian terms, among them the words ''feheruuaru rea meneh hodu utu rea'', "up the military road to [[Székesfehérvár|Fehérvár]]" The rest of the document was written in Latin.<br />
[[File:Ohlm original.jpg|thumb|upright|The oldest extant Hungarian poem, [[Old Hungarian 'Lamentations of Mary'|Old Hungarian Laments of Mary]] (1190s)]]
The oldest remaining complete text in Hungarian language is the [[Funeral Sermon and Prayer]] ''(Halotti beszéd és könyörgés)'' (1192–1195), a translation of a Latin sermon.<br />
The oldest remaining poem in Hungarian is the [[Old Hungarian 'Lamentations of Mary'|Old Hungarian Laments of Mary]] ''(Ómagyar Mária-siralom)'', also a (not very strict) translation from Latin, from the 13th century. It is also the oldest surviving [[Uralic languages|Uralic]] poem.<br />
Among the first chronicles about Hungarian history were [[Gesta Hungarorum]] ("Deeds of the Hungarians") by the unknown author usually called ''Anonymus'', and [[Gesta Hunnorum et Hungarorum]] ("Deeds of the Huns and the Hungarians") by Simon Kézai. Both are in Latin. These chronicles mix history with legends, so historically they are not always authentic. Another chronicle is the ''Képes krónika'' (Illustrated Chronicle), which was written for [[Louis I of Hungary|Louis the Great]].

[[Renaissance]] literature flourished under the reign of [[Matthias Corvinus of Hungary|King Matthias]] (1458–1490). [[Janus Pannonius]], although he wrote in Latin, counts as one of the most important persons in Hungarian literature, being the only significant Hungarian Humanist poet of the period. The first printing house was also founded during Matthias' reign, by [[András Hess]], in Buda. The first book printed in Hungary was the [[Chronica Hungarorum]].
The most important poets of the period was [[Bálint Balassi]] (1554–1594) and [[Nikola Zrinski|Miklós Zrínyi]] (1620–1664).

Balassi's poetry shows medieval influences, his poems can be divided into three sections: love poems, war poems and religious poems. Zrínyi's most significant work, the epic ''[[Peril of Sziget|Szigeti veszedelem]]'' ("Peril of Sziget", written in 1648/49) is written in a fashion similar to the ''[[Iliad]]'', and recounts the heroic [[Battle of Szigetvár]], where his great-grandfather died while defending the castle of Szigetvár.
Among the religious literary works the most important is the Bible translation by [[Gáspár Károli]] (The second Hungarian Bible translation in the history), the Protestant pastor of [[Gönc]], in 1590. The translation is called the ''Bible of Vizsoly'', after the town where it was first published. (See [[Bible translations into Hungarian]] for more details.)

[[File:Marai2.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Sándor Márai]], Hungarian writer and journalist]]

The Hungarian enlightenment took place about fifty years after the French [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]]. The first enlightened writers were [[Archduchess Maria Theresa of Austria (1717–1780)|Maria Theresia]]'s bodyguards ([[György Bessenyei]], [[János Batsányi]] and others). The greatest poets of the time were [[Mihály Csokonai Vitéz]] and [[Dániel Berzsenyi]].
The greatest figure of the language reform was [[Ferenc Kazinczy]]. The [[Hungarian language]] became feasible for all type of scientific explanations from this time, and furthermore many new words were coined for describing new inventions.

[[Hungarian literature]] has recently gained some renown outside the borders of Hungary (mostly through translations into German, French and English). Some modern Hungarian authors have become increasingly popular in Germany and Italy especially [[Sándor Márai]], [[Péter Esterházy]], [[Péter Nádas]] and [[Imre Kertész]]. The latter is a contemporary Jewish writer who survived the Holocaust and won the Nobel Prize for literature in 2002.
The older classics of Hungarian literature and Hungarian poetry have remained almost totally unknown outside Hungary. [[János Arany]], a famous 19th-century Hungarian poet, is still much loved in Hungary (especially his collection of [[Ballads]]), among several other "true classics" like [[Sándor Petőfi]], the poet of the Revolution of 1848, [[Endre Ady]], [[Mihály Babits]], [[Dezső Kosztolányi]], [[Attila József]], [[Miklós Radnóti]] and [[János Pilinszky]]. Other well-known Hungarian authors are [[László Krasznahorkai]], [[Ferenc Móra]], [[Géza Gárdonyi]], [[Zsigmond Móricz]], [[Gyula Illyés]], [[Albert Wass]], [[Miklós Szentkuthy]], [[Magda Szabó]] and [[Stephen Vizinczey]].

Traditional dishes such as the world-famous [[Goulash]] (''gulyás'' stew or ''gulyás'' soup) feature prominently in Hungarian cuisine. Dishes are often flavoured with [[paprika]] (ground red peppers), a Hungarian innovation.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sulinet.hu/tart/fcikk/Kjc/0/23144/1 |title=Sulinet: Magyar növény-e a paprika? |publisher=Sulinet.hu |access-date=21 November 2008 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080620004145/http://www.sulinet.hu/tart/fcikk/Kjc/0/23144/1 |archive-date=20 June 2008 }}</ref> The paprika powder, obtained from a special type of pepper, is one of the most common spices used in typical Hungarian cuisine. Thick, heavy Hungarian sour cream called ''[[tejföl]]'' is often used to soften the dishes' flavour. The famous Hungarian hot river fish soup called Fisherman's soup or ''[[halászlé]]'' is usually a rich mixture of several kinds of poached fish.<ref>{{cite book |first=Karoly |last=Gundel |title=Gundel's Hungarian cookbook |publisher=Corvina |location=Budapest |year=1992 |isbn=963-13-3600-X |oclc=32227400}}page 23</ref>

Other dishes are chicken paprikash, [[foie gras]] made of goose liver, ''[[pörkölt]]'' stew, ''vadas'', (game stew with vegetable gravy and [[Spätzle|dumplings]]), [[trout]] with almonds and salty and sweet dumplings, like ''[[túrós csusza]]'', (dumplings with fresh [[quark (cheese)|quark]] cheese and thick sour cream).

The ''csárda'' is the most distinctive type of Hungarian inn, an old-style tavern offering traditional cuisine and beverages. ''Borozó'' usually denotes a cosy old-fashioned wine tavern, ''pince'' is a beer or wine cellar and a ''söröző'' is a [[pub]] offering draught beer and sometimes meals. The ''bisztró'' is an inexpensive restaurant often with self-service. The ''büfé'' is the cheapest place, although one may have to eat standing at a counter. Pastries, cakes and coffee are served at the confectionery called ''cukrászda'', while an ''eszpresszó'' is a café.

[[Pálinka]] is a fruit brandy, distilled from fruit grown in the orchards situated on the [[Great Hungarian Plain]]. It is a spirit native to Hungary and comes in a variety of flavours including apricot (''barack'') and cherry (''cseresznye''). However, plum (''szilva'') is the most popular flavour. Beer goes well with many traditional Hungarian dishes. The five main Hungarian beer brands are: [[Borsod Brewery|Borsodi]], [[Soproni]], [[Arany Ászok]], [[Kõbányai]], and [[Dreher Brewery|Dreher]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gaultmillau.hu/kalauz-2017/sorhelyzet-magyarorszag-2016|title=Sörhelyzet, Magyarország 2016 – Gault&Millau kalauz – Gault&Millau Magyarország|access-date=19 March 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170304184347/http://www.gaultmillau.hu/kalauz-2017/sorhelyzet-magyarorszag-2016|archive-date=4 March 2017|url-status=dead}}</ref> In Hungary, people traditionally do not clink their glasses or mugs when drinking beer. There is an urban legend in Hungarian culture that Austrian generals clinked their beer glasses to celebrate the execution of [[the 13 Martyrs of Arad]] in 1849. Many people still follow the tradition, although younger people often disavow it, citing that the vow was only meant to last 150 years.<ref>{{cite web|title=Koccintás sörrel |url=http://www.urbanlegends.hu/2005/06/17/koccintas-sorrel/ |access-date=29 July 2011 |language=hu |date=17 June 2005 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090309015613/http://www.urbanlegends.hu/2005/06/17/koccintas-sorrel/ |archive-date=9 March 2009 }}</ref>

Wine: As [[Hugh Johnson (wine)|Hugh Johnson]] says in ''The History of Wine'', the territory of Hungary is ideal for wine-making and the country can be divided to six wine regions: [[North-Transdanubia]], [[Lake Balaton]], [[South-Pannónia]], [[Duna-region]] or Alföld, [[Upper-Hungary]] and [[Tokaj-Hegyalja]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.njt.hu/cgi_bin/njt_doc.cgi?docid=125985 |title=127/2009.

The [[Hungarians]] brought their wine-making knowledge from the East. According to [[Ahmad ibn Rustah|Ibn Rustah]], the Hungarian tribes were familiar with wine-making long time before the [[Hungarian conquest of the Carpathian Basin]].<ref>Ian Spencer Hornsey, The Chemistry and Biology of Winemaking, Royal Society of Chemistry, 2007, p. 49, {{ISBN|9780854042661}}</ref>

Hungarian wine regions offer a great variety of styles: the main products of the country are elegant and full-bodied dry whites with good acidity, although complex sweet whites (Tokaj), elegant ([[Eger]]) and full-bodied robust reds ([[Villány]] and [[Szekszárd]]). The main varieties are: [[Olaszrizling]], [[Hárslevelű]], [[Furmint]], [[Pinot gris]] or Szürkebarát, [[Chardonnay]] (whites), [[Kékfrankos]] (or Blaufrankisch in German), [[Kadarka]], [[Portugieser]], [[Zweigelt]], [[Cabernet sauvignon]], [[Cabernet franc]] and [[Merlot]]. The most famous wines from Hungary are [[Tokaji Aszú]] and [[Egri Bikavér]].<ref>This is the world-famous sweet, topaz-colored wine known throughout the English-speaking world as '''Tokay'''. "A rich, sweet, moderately strong wine of a topaz color, produced in the vicinity of Tokay, in Hungary; also, a similar wine produced elsewhere."

For over 150 years, a blend of forty Hungarian herbs has been used to create the liqueur [[Unicum]].

=== Recreation ===
[[File:Hévíz.jpg|thumb|[[Lake Hévíz]], the largest thermal lake in Europe]]
Hungary is a land of [[thermal]] water. A passion for spa culture and [[Hungarian history]] have been connected from the very beginning. Hungarian spas feature [[ancient Rome|Roman]], [[Greek architecture|Greek]], [[Architecture of Turkey|Turkish]], and northern country architectural elements.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.visitspas.eu/hungary/ |title=Hungary (Magyarország) – spa resorts & hotels |publisher=Visitspas.eu |access-date=18 August 2012}}</ref>

Because of an advantageous geographical location, good quality thermal water can be found in great quantities on over 80% of Hungary's territory. Approximately 1,500 thermal springs can be found in Hungary (more than 100 just in the Capital area). There are approximately 450 public baths in Hungary.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.umvp.eu/english/about-hungary.html|title=New Hungary Rural Development Programme|website=Umvp.eu|access-date=23 January 2017}}</ref>

The [[ancient Rome|Romans]] heralded the first age of spas in Hungary. The remains of their bath complexes are still to be seen in [[Óbuda]]. Spa culture was revived during the [[Turkish Invasion]] and the thermal springs of [[Buda]] were used for the construction of a number of bathhouses, some of which such as ([[Király Baths]], [[Rudas Baths]]) are still functioning.

In the 19th century, the advancement in deep drilling and medical science provided the springboard for a further leap in bathing culture. Grand spas such as [[Gellért Baths]], Lukács Baths, [[Margaret Island]], and [[Széchenyi Medicinal Bath]] are a reflection of this resurgence in popularity. The Széchenyi Thermal Bath is the largest spa complex in Europe and it was the first thermal bath built in the Pest side of Budapest.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ticket.info.hu/en/program/baths-of-budapest/szechenyi-bath|title=Széchenyi Bath|publisher=Hungária Koncert Kft.|access-date=13 July 2015|location=Budapest}}</ref> This building is a noted example of modern Renaissance style.

=== Folk art ===
[[File:Voivodina Hungarians national costume and dance 6.jpg|thumb|left|Hungarians dancing [[csárdás]] in traditional garments / folk costumes]]

[[Ugrós]] (Jumping dances) are old style dances dating back to the [[Middle Ages]].
Solo or couple dances accompanied by old style music, shepherd and other solo man's dances from [[Transylvania]], and marching dances along with remnants of medieval weapon dances belong in this group.

[[Karikázó]] is a circle dance performed by women only accompanied by singing of folk songs.

[[Csárdás]] are new style dances developed in the 18–19th centuries. Csárdás is the Hungarian name for the national dances, with Hungarian embroidered costumes and energetic music. From the men's intricate bootslapping dances to the ancient women's circle dances, Csárdás demonstrates the infectious exuberance of the Hungarian folk dancing still celebrated in the villages.

[[Verbunkos]] is a solo man's dance evolved from the recruiting performances of the [[Austria-Hungary|Austro-Hungarian]] army.

The [[Legényes]] is a men's solo dance done by the ethnic Hungarian people living in the [[Kalotaszeg]] region of Transylvania. Although usually danced by young men, it can be also danced by older men. The dance is generally performed freestyle by one dancer at a time in front of a band. Women participate in the dance by standing in lines to the side, and singing or shouting verses while the men dance. Each man performs a number of points (dance phrases), typically four to eight without repetition. Each point consists of four parts, each lasting four counts. The first part is usually the same for everyone (there are only a few variations).

It was in the beginning of the 18th-century that the present style of Hungarian folk art took shape, incorporating both [[Renaissance]] and [[Baroque]] elements, depending on the area, as well as Persian [[Sassanide]] influences. Flowers and leaves, sometimes a bird or a spiral ornament, are the principal decorative themes. The most frequent ornament is a flower with a centrepiece resembling the eye of a peacock's feather.

Nearly all the manifestations of folk art practiced elsewhere in Europe also flourished among the [[hungarian people|Magyar]] peasantry at one time or another, their ceramics and textile being the most highly developed of all.

The finest achievements in their textile arts are the embroideries which vary from region to region. Those of [[Kalotaszeg]] in Transylvania are charming products of Oriental design, sewn chiefly in a single colour&nbsp;– red, blue, or black. Soft in line, the embroideries are applied on altar cloths, pillow-cases and sheets.

In Hungary proper, Sárköz in [[Transdanubia]] and the [[Mezőkövesd|Matyóföld]] in the [[Great Hungarian Plain]] produce the finest embroideries. In the [[Tolna (county)|Sárköz]] region the women's caps show black and white designs as delicate as lace, and give evidence of the people's wonderfully subtle artistic feeling. The embroidery motifs applied to women's wear have also been transposed to tablecloths and runners suitable for modern use as wall decorations.

These vessels, made of black clay, reflect more than three hundred years of traditional Transdanubian folk patterns and shapes. No two are precisely alike, since all work is done by hand, including both the shaping and the decorating. The imprints are made by the thumb or a finger of the ceramist who makes the piece.

=== Porcelain ===
{{Main|Herend Porcelain|Zsolnay}}
Founded in 1826, [[Herend Porcelain]] is one of the world's largest ceramic factories, specialising in luxury hand painted and gilded [[porcelain]]. In the mid-19th century it was purveyor to the [[Habsburg Dynasty]] and aristocratic customers throughout Europe. Many of its classic patterns are still in production. After the fall of communism in Hungary, the factory was privatised and is now 75% owned by its management and workers, exporting to over 60 countries of the world.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.herend.com/ |title=Herend Porcelain Manufactory Ltd |publisher=Herend.com |access-date=20 September 2009}}</ref>

Zsolnay Porcelain Manufacture is a Hungarian manufacturer of porcelain, pottery, ceramics, tiles and stoneware. The company introduced the eosin glazing process and pyrogranite ceramics.
The Zsolnay factory was established by Miklós Zsolnay in [[Pécs]], Hungary, to produce stoneware and ceramics in 1853. In 1863, his son, [[Vilmos Zsolnay]] (1828–1900) joined the company and became its manager and director after several years. He led the factory to worldwide recognition by demonstrating its innovative products at world fairs and international exhibitions, including the 1873 World Fair in Vienna, then at the 1878 World Fair in Paris, where Zsolnay received a Grand Prix.

It is geographically situated as part of the [[Windward Islands]] chain in the [[Lesser Antilles]] archipelago in the [[Caribbean Sea]]. The island is located near [[Guadeloupe]] to the northwest and [[Martinique]] to the south-southeast. Its area is {{Convert|750|km2|abbr=on}}, and the highest point is [[Morne Diablotins]], at {{Convert|1447|m|abbr=on}} in elevation. The population was 71,293 at the 2011 census.<ref name="2011 census"/>

The island was settled by the [[Arawak]] arriving from South America in the 5th century. The [[Kalinago]] displaced the Arawak by the 15th century. [[Christopher Columbus|Columbus]] is said to have passed the island on Sunday, 3 November, 1493. It was later colonised by Europeans, predominantly by the French from the 1690s to 1763. The French imported enslaved people from West Africa to Dominica to work on coffee plantations. [[Kingdom of Great Britain|Great Britain]] took possession in 1763 after the [[Seven Years' War]], and it gradually established English as its official language. The island gained independence as a republic in 1978.

Dominica has been nicknamed the "Nature Isle of the Caribbean" for its natural environment.<ref>P. C. Evans & [[Lennox Honychurch|L.

The island has lush mountainous [[rainforests]], and it is the home of many rare plants, animals, and bird species. There are [[xeric]] areas in some of the western coastal regions, but heavy rainfall occurs inland. The [[imperial amazon|sisserou parrot]], also known as the imperial amazon and found only on Dominica, is the island's national bird  and featured on the [[Flag of Dominica|national flag]], which is one of only two national flags containing the colour purple (the other being [[Nicaragua]]).<ref>{{cite web |title=Country Flags With Purple |url=https://www.worldatlas.com/articles/country-flags-with-purple.html |website=World Atlas |access-date=3 April 2019}}</ref> The country is a member of the [[Commonwealth of Nations]], the [[United Nations]], the [[Organization of American States]] and the [[Non-Aligned Movement]].

{{main|History of Dominica}}

=== Geologic history ===
Dominica first emerged from the sea during the [[Oligocene]] era approximately 26 million years ago, making it one of the last Caribbean islands to be formed by [[Volcanism|volcanic activity]].

=== Pre-colonial period and early European contact ===
Dominica's precolonial indigenous inhabitants were the [[Island Carib]] people, who are thought to have driven out the previous [[Arawak]] population.<ref name="Encyclopedia Britannica - Dominica">{{cite web |url=https://www.britannica.com/place/Dominica |title=Encyclopedia Britannica - Dominica |access-date= 29 June 2019}}</ref> The Caribs called the island ''Wai‘tu kubuli'', which means "Tall is her body."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dominica.dm/site/dominica.cfm |title=Discover Dominica: an introduction to our Caribbean island |publisher=Dominica.dm |access-date=2010-06-27 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100923082054/http://dominica.dm/site/dominica.cfm |archive-date=23 September 2010}}</ref>

[[Christopher Columbus]], sailing for [[Spain]], named the island as Dominica, after the [[Latin language|Latin]] term ''dies Dominica'' for [[Sunday]], the day on which the Spanish first saw it in November 1493.<ref name="Encyclopedia Britannica - Dominica"/> Some Spanish colonisers settled here. But, as European explorers and settlers entered the region, indigenous refugees from surrounding islands settled Dominica and pushed out the Spanish settlers. The Spanish instead settled other areas that were easier to control and had more natural resources.

=== French colony ===
{{Main|French West Indies}}

Spain had little success in colonising Dominica. In 1632, the French [[Compagnie des Îles de l'Amérique]] claimed it and other ''"Petites Antilles"'' for [[Kingdom of France|France]], but no physical occupation took place.<ref name="Encyclopedia Britannica - Dominica"/> Between 1642 and 1650, French missionary [[Raymond Breton]] became the first regular European visitor to the island.

In 1660, the French and English agreed that Dominica and [[Saint Vincent (island)|St. Vincent]] should not be settled, but instead left to the Carib as neutral territory.<ref name="Encyclopedia Britannica - Dominica"/> But its natural resources attracted expeditions of English and French foresters, who began harvesting timber.<ref name="bn">"Background note: Dominica". [[U.S. Department of State]] (July 2008). {{PD-notice}}</ref> In 1690, the French established their first permanent settlements. French woodcutters from [[Martinique]] and [[Guadeloupe]] began to set up timber camps to supply the French islands with wood, and they gradually became permanent settlers. They brought the first enslaved Africans from West Africa to ''Dominique'', as they called it in French.

In 1715, a revolt of "poor white" smallholders in the north of Martinique, known as La Gaoulé,<ref>P.C. Emmer & BW Highman, (1999) ''General History of the Caribbean: Methodology and Historiography of the Caribbean,'' volume 6, [https://books.google.com/books?id=E12cpltazYgC&lpg=PA637 p. 637]</ref> caused settlers to migrate to southern Dominique, where they set up [[smallholding]]s. Meanwhile, French families and others from Guadeloupe settled in the north. In 1727, the first French commander, [[M. Le Grand]], took charge of the island with a basic French government. Dominique formally became a [[colony]] of France, and the island was divided into districts or "quarters".<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.lennoxhonychurch.com/article.cfm?Id=394 |title=Important Dates in Dominica's History |publisher=Lennox Honychurch |date=1990-07-05 |access-date=2013-09-29 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130830091704/http://www.lennoxhonychurch.com/article.cfm?Id=394 |archive-date=30 August 2013}}</ref> The French had already developed plantation agriculture on Martinique and Guadeloupe, where they cultivated [[sugarcane]] with enslaved African workers. In Dominique they gradually developed coffee plantations. They imported so many African [[slaves]] to fill the labour demands that the population became predominantly African in ethnicity.

In 1761, during the [[Seven Years' War]] in Europe, a [[British expedition against Dominica]] led by [[Andrew Rollo, 5th Lord Rollo|Andrew Rollo]] conquered the island, along with several other Caribbean islands. In 1763, France had lost the war and ceded the island to Great Britain under the [[Treaty of Paris (1763)|Treaty of Paris]].<ref name="Encyclopedia Britannica - Dominica"/> The same year, the British established a [[legislative assembly]], with only European colonists represented. French remained the official language, but [[Antillean Creole]], which had developed from it, was spoken by most of the population.

In 1778 the French, with the active co-operation of the population, began the [[Invasion of Dominica (1778)|re-capture of Dominica]].<ref name="Encyclopedia Britannica - Dominica"/> This was ended by the [[Treaty of Paris (1783)]], which returned the island to British control. But the island population, especially the class of [[gens de couleur|free people of color]], resisted British restrictions. The British retained control through French invasions in 1795 and 1805,<ref name="Encyclopedia Britannica - Dominica"/><ref name="bn" /> the first taking place during the period of the [[Haitian Revolution]], which gained the independence of Haiti (formerly Saint-Domingue, France's richest Caribbean colony).

=== British colony ===
{{Main|British West Indies|British Leeward Islands|British Windward Islands}}

Great Britain established a small colony in 1805. It used Dominica as part of the [[triangular trade]], by which slaves were imported and sold as labour in the islands as part of a trade that included producing and shipping sugar and coffee as commodity crops to Europe. The best documented slave plantation on the island is Hillsborough Estate, which had 71 male and 68 female slaves.<!-- when? -->  The [[Quarry Bank Mill|Greg]] family were notable: Thomas Hodgson, a brother-in-law, owned a slave ship, and Thomas Greg and his son John Greg were part-owners of [[sugar plantation]]s on Dominica.  In January 1814, 20 slaves absconded from Hillsborough. They were recorded as recaptured and punished with 100 lashes applied to the males and 50 for the females. The slaves reportedly said that one of their people had died in the plantation hospital, and they believed he had been poisoned.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://janus.lib.cam.ac.uk/db/node.xsp?id=EAD/GBR/0115/RCMS+266|title=Janus: Dominica Estate documents|website=janus.lib.cam.ac.uk}}</ref>

In 1831, reflecting a liberalisation of official British racial attitudes, the Brown Privilege Bill<ref>{{cite book |url=https://archive.org/details/antislaverymont00englgoog |page=[https://archive.org/details/antislaverymont00englgoog/page/n279 211] |title=Anti-Slavery Monthly Reporter, volume 3|publisher=London Society for the Mitigation and Abolition of Slavery in the British Dominions |author=London Society for the Abolition of Slavery throughout the British Dominions|year=1831}}</ref> conferred political and social rights on [[free black]]s (mostly [[free people of colour]], who generally were of [[mixed race]], with African and European ancestry). With the [[Slavery Abolition Act 1833|Slavery Abolition Act of 1833]], Britain ended the institution of slavery throughout [[British Empire|its empire]], except in India.<ref name=SectionLXIV>{{cite web |url=http://www.pdavis.nl/Legis_07.htm |title=Slavery Abolition Act 1833; Section LXIV |date=28 August 1833 |access-date=3 June 2008}}</ref>

With freedom came enfranchisement. In 1835, the first three men of African descent were elected to the legislative assembly of Dominica. Many slaves from the neighbouring French colonial islands of Guadeloupe and Martinique fled to Dominica. In 1838, Dominica became the first colony of the [[British West Indies]] to have an elected legislature controlled by an ethnic African majority. Most of these legislators had been free people of colour and smallholders or merchants before the abolition of slavery. Their economic and social views were different from the interests of the small, wealthy English [[plantation|planter]] class. Reacting to a perceived threat to their power, the planters lobbied for more direct British rule.<ref name=bn/>

In 1865, after much agitation and tension, the colonial office replaced the elective assembly with one made up of one-half members who were elected and one-half who were appointed. Planters, who were allied with colonial administrators, outmanoeuvred the elected legislators on many occasions. In 1871, Dominica became part of the [[British Leeward Islands]]. The political power of the ethnic African population progressively eroded. [[Crown colony]] government was re-established in 1896. All political rights were curtailed for people of colour and blacks, who were the overwhelming majority of the population. Development aid, offered as compensation for disfranchisement, resulted in negligible improvements in conditions for most ethnic Africans.<ref name=bn/><!--expand - needs population numbers so readers can understand proportions-->

In [[World War I]], many Dominicans, mainly the sons of small farmers, volunteered to fight in Europe for the British Empire. After the war, an upsurge of political consciousness throughout the Caribbean led to the formation of the [[List of historical autonomist and secessionist movements#British West Indies|Representative Government Association]]. Marshaling public frustration with the lack of a voice in governing Dominica, this group won one-third of the popularly elected seats of the legislative assembly in 1924, and one-half in 1936. In 1940, administration of Dominica was transferred from the [[British Leeward Islands]] to the [[British Windward Islands]].<ref name=bn/> During [[World War II]], some Dominicans volunteered in British and Caribbean forces. Thousands of [[Free French]] refugees from Martinique and Guadeloupe escaped to Dominica from the [[Vichy France|Vichy]]-controlled French islands, staying in [[Roseau]] and other villages.

Until 1958, Dominica was governed as part of the [[British Windward Islands]]. Caribbean islands sought independence from 1958 to 1962, and Dominica became a province of the short-lived [[West Indies Federation]] in 1958.<ref name="Encyclopedia Britannica - Dominica"/><ref name=bn/> After the federation dissolved in 1962, Dominica became an associated state of the United Kingdom in 1967, and formally took responsibility for its internal affairs.<ref name="Encyclopedia Britannica - Dominica"/> On 3 November 1978, the Commonwealth of Dominica was granted independence as a [[republic]], led by Prime Minister [[Patrick John]].<ref name="Encyclopedia Britannica - Dominica"/><ref name=bn/><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/1978/1031/contents/made|title=The Dominica Termination of Association Order 1978|website=www.legislation.gov.uk}}</ref>

===Post-independence===
In mid-1979, political discontent with Founding Prime Minister Patrick John's administration climaxed in a civilian coup and ended in the passage of a Motion of No Confidence in the House of Assembly, Dominica's legislature, against John, collapsing the John administration. A new, so-called "Interim Government" was formed under Dominica's second Prime Minister [[Oliver Seraphin]];<ref name="Encyclopedia Britannica - Dominica"/> Seraphin's main task was to prepare the country for fresh general elections constitutionally due in 1980, hence the unofficial title "Interim" Prime Minister. Seraphin organized and led a splinter of the Dominica Labour Party called the Democratic Labour Party into the 1980 general election and lost mainly because his nearly thirteen month-long premiership was dominated by the fallout from Category Five [[Hurricane David]], which caused 56 deaths and untold damage across the island.<ref name="Encyclopedia Britannica - Dominica"/><ref name="tcr3">{{cite web|url=http://www.nhc.noaa.gov/archive/storm_wallets/atlantic/atl1979-prelim/david/prelim03.gif|title=Hurricane David Preliminary Report, Page 3|last=Lawrence|first=Miles|year=1979|publisher=National Hurricane Center|access-date=5 October 2010}}</ref> [[Hurricane Allen]] the following year caused further damage.<ref name="Encyclopedia Britannica - Dominica"/> After the [[1980 Dominican general election|1980 election]], Seraphin's government was replaced by one led by the [[Dominica Freedom Party]] (DFP) under Prime Minister [[Eugenia Charles]]; she was the Caribbean's first female Prime Minister.<ref name="Encyclopedia Britannica - Dominica"/><ref name=":0">{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=nbGcAQAAQBAJ&q=eugenia+charles+pulmonary&pg=PA210|title=Oxford Dictionary of National Biography 2005–2008|last=Goldman|first=Lawrence|publisher= Oxford University Press|year=2013|isbn=9780199671540|pages=210|language=en}}</ref>

In 1981, Charles's government was threatened with two attempted coups. The first was led by [[Frederick Newton]], commander of the [[Military of Dominica]], who organised an attack on the police headquarters in Roseau which resulted in the death of a police officer.<ref name=coup>{{cite news|title=Ex-Commander Hanged For Dominica Coup Role|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1986/08/09/world/around-the-world-ex-commander-hanged-for-dominica-coup-role.html|work=[[The New York Times]]|publisher=[[Associated Press]]|date=9 August 1986|access-date=26 August 2009}}</ref> Newton and five other soldiers were found guilty in the attack and sentenced to death in 1983; the sentences of the five accomplices were later commuted to life in prison, but Newton was executed in 1986.<ref name=coup/> A second occurred later in the year when the country was threatened with a takeover by [[mercenaries]]<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.country-data.com/cgi-bin/query/r-3376.html |title=Caribbean Islands – Regional Security Threats, 1970–81 |publisher=Country-data.com |access-date=2010-06-27}}</ref> in [[Operation Red Dog]], led by [[Mike Perdue]] and [[Wolfgang Droege]]. They tried to overthrow Charles as Prime Minister and reinstall ex-Prime Minister John in exchange for control over the country's development. The [[Federal Bureau of Investigation|FBI]] was tipped off, and the ship hired to transport the mercenaries never left dock. The mercenaries lacked formal military experience or training, and most of the crew had been misled into joining by the ringleader Mike Perdue. [[White supremacy|White supremacist]] [[Don Black (white nationalist)|Don Black]] was also jailed for his part in the attempted coup, which violated US [[Neutrality Act of 1794|neutrality]] laws.<ref>[https://www.amazon.com/Bayou-Pigs-Audacious-Tropical-Criminal/dp/0470153822 Stewart Bell, ''Bayou of Pigs''], presents the story of the planned coup.</ref>

[[File:President Ronald Reagan meets with Prime Minister Eugenia Charles.jpg|thumb|right|[[Eugenia Charles]], Prime Minister 1980–95, discussing the [[United States invasion of Grenada|situation in Grenada]] in 1983 with US President [[Ronald Reagan]]]]

The Charles government supported the 1983 American [[Invasion of Grenada]], earning Dominica praise from the Reagan administration and an increase in financial aid.<ref>Woodward, Bob, ''Veil: the Secret Wars of the CIA 1981-1987'', New York: Simon and Schuster, 1987, pp. 290, 300.<!-- ISSN/ISBN needed --></ref>

By the middle of the 1980s, the economy had begun to recover,<ref name="Encyclopedia Britannica - Dominica"/> before weakening again due to a decrease in [[banana]] prices. Eugenia Charles won the [[1985 Dominican general election|1985]] general election, becoming only the first incumbent Dominica Prime Minister to be popularly re-elected. The continuing downturn in the economy and the tight grip by Eugenia Charles on Dominica politics gave rise to a self-titled "Third Force" political formation in 1988, which disrupted the traditional two-party arrangement of governing DFP and opposition DLP. "Third Force" soon formalized as United Workers Party and selected as its leader Edison James, the former General Manager of the Dominica Banana Marketing Company. This was a strategic selection given James's prestige among banana farmers and his originating from the East or Atlantic Coast that had begun to feel alienated by the West or Caribbean Sea Coast elites in Roseau, Dominica's capital.<ref name=bn/> Eugenia Charles again won the [[1990 Dominican general election|1990]] general election, the first incumbent Dominica Prime Minister to win three consecutive general elections. However, Eugenia Charles's DFP had been pushed to within one seat of losing its majority in Parliament by the emergence of the UWP. It was, therefore, no great surprise when Eugenia Charles gave up political leadership of the Dominica Freedom Party in 1993 and did not contest the 1995 general election in any capacity. No longer benefiting from the veteran charismatic leadership of Prime Minister Eugenia Charles, the Dominica Freedom Party lost the [[1995 Dominican general election|1995 election]] to the [[United Workers' Party (Dominica)|United Workers' Party]] (UWP), whose leader [[Edison James]] became Prime Minister.<ref name="Encyclopedia Britannica - Dominica"/> James, former General Manager of the Dominica Banana Marketing Company attempted to diversify the Dominican economy away from over-reliance on bananas. The crop was largely destroyed by [[Hurricane Luis]] in 1995.<ref name="Encyclopedia Britannica - Dominica"/> Further James was unable to restore banana to its former selling price and prestige. Moreover, the James administration became embroiled in Opposition charges of official corruption.

In the [[2000 Dominican general election|31 January, 2000 general election]], the UWP were defeated by a coalition of the DLP, led by left-leaning [[Rosie Douglas|Roosevelt B. "Rosie" Douglas]] and the Dominica Freedom Party led by former trade union leader, [[Charles Savarin]]. Douglas became Prime Minister. One UWP member of the House of Assembly crossed the floor, joining the DLP-DFP coalition government. However, Douglas died on 1 October, 2000 after only a few months.<ref name="Encyclopedia Britannica - Dominica"/><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mathaba.net/rosie/rosiedeath2.html|title=www.mathaba.net|website=www.mathaba.net|access-date=12 May 2018}}</ref><ref>Ellsworth Carter, "Dominica Leader Douglas Dies", Mathaba.net.</ref> Prime Minister Douglas was replaced by [[Pierre Charles (Dominican politician)|Pierre Charles]], who also died in office on 6 January, 2004.<ref name="Encyclopedia Britannica - Dominica"/> [[Roosevelt Skerrit]], also of the DLP, replaced Pierre Charles as Prime Minister, becoming the world's youngest head of government at thirty-one.<ref name="Encyclopedia Britannica - Dominica"/> Under Skerrit's leadership, the DLP won [[2005 Dominican general election|elections in May 2005]] that gave the party 12 seats in the 21-seat Parliament, to the UWP's 8 seats. An independent candidate affiliated with the DLP won a seat as well. Later, the independent candidate joined the government.<ref name=bn/> With his 2005 election win, Skerrit became only the second incumbent Prime Minister of seven to be popularly re-elected.

In the [[2009 Dominican general election|2009 election]], the DLP won 18 of 21 seats. The UWP claimed campaign improprieties and embarked on a wide range of protest actions, including boycott of Parliament. UWP's boycott lasted at least three unauthorized absences from Parliament for two of their three Elected Representatives in Parliament in violation of Parliamentary procedure, leading to their two seats being declared vacant and by-elections being called to fill them; by-elections were conducted for those two vacant seats in July 2010, and the UWP again won both seats.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://2009-2017.state.gov/r/pa/ei/bgn/2295.htm |title=U.S. Department of State Background Note on Dominica|publisher=State.gov |date=2013-02-07 |access-date=2013-09-29}}</ref> The DLP under Skerrit went on to win the [[2014 Dominican general election]].<ref name=CE>[http://www.caribbeanelections.com/dm/elections/dm_results_2014.asp General Election Results - 8 December 2014] Caribbean Elections</ref>

On 17 September, 2012 [[Eliud Williams|Eliud Thaddeus Williams]] was sworn in as President (a largely ceremonial role), replacing [[Nicholas Liverpool|Dr. Nicholas Liverpool]] who was reportedly removed from office due to ill health. On 30 September, 2013 former Trade Union leader and former Dominica Freedom Party leader Charles Savarin was elected president having only days before resigned as a Minister of Government.

===Fauna===
The [[Imperial amazon|Sisserou parrot]] (''Amazona imperialis'') is Dominica's national bird and is [[endemism|endemic]] to its mountain forests.<ref name="Encyclopedia Britannica - Dominica"/> A related species, the Jaco or [[red-necked parrot]] (''A. arausiaca''), is also a Dominican endemic.<ref name="Encyclopedia Britannica - Dominica"/> Both birds are rare and protected, though some forest is still threatened by logging in addition to the long-standing threat of hurricanes.

Dominica is home to 195 species of birds, because of the isolated location of Dominica this is a lesser number compared to [[Trinidad]] which is located closer to mainland [[South-America]] with 472 bird species.

The Caribbean Sea offshore of the island of Dominica is home to many [[cetacean]]s. Most notably a group of [[sperm whale]]s live in this area year-round. Other cetaceans commonly seen in the area include [[spinner dolphin]]s, [[pantropical spotted dolphin]]s and [[bottlenose dolphin]]s. Less commonly seen animals include [[killer whales]], [[false killer whale]]s, [[pygmy sperm whale]]s, [[dwarf sperm whale]]s, [[Risso's dolphin]]s, [[common dolphin]]s, [[Atlantic spotted dolphin]]s, [[humpback whales]] and [[Bryde's whale]]s. This makes Dominica a destination for tourists interested in [[whale-watching]].

===Territorial disputes===

Dominica is a [[parliamentary democracy]] within the [[Commonwealth of Nations]].<ref name="English_constitution" /> The capital is [[Roseau]]. The Commonwealth of Dominica is one of the Caribbean's few [[republic]]s. The president is the [[head of state]], while executive power rests with the [[Cabinet (government)|cabinet]], headed by the [[prime minister]].<ref name="English_constitution" /> The [[unicameral]] [[parliament]] consists of the 30-member [[House of Assembly of Dominica|House of Assembly]], which consists of 21 directly elected members and nine senators, who may either be appointed by the president or elected by the other members of the House of Assembly.<ref name="English_constitution" />

Unlike other former British colonies in the region, Dominica was never a [[Commonwealth realm]], instead becoming a republic on independence. Dominica is a full and participating member of the [[Caribbean Community|Caribbean Community (CARICOM)]] and the [[Organisation of Eastern Caribbean States]] (OECS).<ref name="Encyclopedia Britannica - Dominica"/>

Dominica is also a member of the [[International Criminal Court]], with a [[Bilateral Immunity Agreement]] of protection with the US military, as covered under [[Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court|Article 98]]. In January 2008, Dominica joined the [[Bolivarian Alternative for the Americas]].<ref name="Encyclopedia Britannica - Dominica"/>

{{main|Economy of Dominica}}
[[File:Tree map export 2009 Dominica.jpeg|thumb|Graphical depiction of Dominica's product exports in 28 colour-coded categories.]]Dominica's currency is the [[East Caribbean Dollar]]. In 2008, Dominica had one of the lowest [[per capita]] [[gross domestic product]] (GDP) rates of Eastern Caribbean states.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://2009-2017.state.gov/r/pa/ei/bgn/2295.htm|title=Dominica|website=U.S. Department of State|access-date=4 August 2020}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://siteresources.worldbank.org/INTOECS/Resources/Dominica.AAG.pdf|title=(World Bank 'At A Glance')}}</ref> The country nearly had a financial crisis in 2003 and 2004, but Dominica's economy grew by 3.5% in 2005 and 4.0% in 2006, following a decade of poor performance. Growth in 2006 was attributed to gains in tourism, construction, offshore and other services, and some sub-sectors of the banana industry. Around this time the [[International Monetary Fund]] (IMF) praised the Government of Dominica for its successful macroeconomic reforms, but also pointed out remaining challenges, including the need for further reductions in public debt, increased financial sector regulation, and market diversification.<ref name="bn" />

Agriculture and especially bananas once dominated Dominica's economy,<ref name="CIA World Factbook - Dominica"/> and nearly one-third of the labour force worked in agriculture in the early 2000s. This sector, however, is highly vulnerable to weather conditions and to external events affecting commodity prices. In 2007, [[Hurricane Dean]] caused significant damage to the agricultural sector as well as the country's infrastructure, especially roads.{{citation needed|date=February 2020}} In response to reduced [[European Union]] (EU) [[trade preference]]s for bananas from the former European colonies after the 2009 [[WTO]] decision,<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/1999/mar/05/eu.wto3|title=The banana wars explained|first=By Patrick|last=Barkham|date=5 March 1999|access-date=4 August 2020|via=www.theguardian.com}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/business-20263308|title=Banana war ends after 20 years|date=8 November 2012|access-date=4 August 2020|via=www.bbc.com}}</ref><ref>https://econlife.com/2018/06/banana-trade-war-2/</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.europarl.europa.eu/news/en/headlines/world/20110121STO12285/ending-the-banana-wars-who-wins-and-who-loses|title=Ending the banana wars: Who wins and who loses? &#124; News &#124; European Parliament|date=24 January 2011|website=www.europarl.europa.eu|access-date=4 August 2020}}</ref> the government has diversified the agricultural sector by promoting the production of coffee, [[patchouli]], [[aloe vera]], cut flowers, and exotic fruits such as mango, guava and papaya,{{citation needed|date=February 2020}} while the economy has become increasingly dependent on tourism.<ref name="CIA World Factbook - Dominica"/>

=== International trade ===
Dominica is a beneficiary of the [[Caribbean Basin Initiative]] (CBI) that grants duty-free entry into the United States for many goods. Dominica also belongs to the predominantly English-speaking [[Caribbean Community]] (CARICOM), the [[CARICOM Single Market and Economy]] (CSME), and the [[Organisation of Eastern Caribbean States]] (OECS).<ref name="bn" />

=== Financial services industry ===
The Commonwealth of Dominica is becoming in recent years{{when|date=February 2020}} a major international financial centre. The largest sectors are "[[offshore banking]], [[payment processing]] companies, and general corporate activities". Regulation and supervision of the [[financial services]] industry is the responsibility of the [[Financial Service Unit of the Commonwealth of Dominica]] (FSU) under the supervision of the Ministry of Finance. There are a number of service providers. These include global financial institutions including [[Scotiabank]], [[Royal Bank of Canada]], [[Cathedral Investment Bank]], [[First Caribbean International Bank]], and The Interoceanic Bank of the Caribbean.

Starting in the mid-late 1990s, [[offshore financial centres]], such as the Commonwealth of Dominica, came under increasing pressure from the [[OECD]] for their allegedly harmful tax regimes, where the OECD wished to prevent low-tax regimes from having an advantage in the global marketplace. The OECD threatened to place the Commonwealth of Dominica and other [[financial centres]] on a "black list" and impose sanctions against them. However, the Commonwealth of Dominica successfully avoided being placed on the OECD black list by committing to regulatory reform to improve transparency and begin information exchange with OECD member countries about their citizens.

Dominica supposedly offers tax-free status to companies relocating from abroad. It is not known how many companies benefit from the tax-free status because of the strict confidentiality the government enforces, although it is known many [[Internet]] businesses and [[hedge fund]]s utilise Dominica for this reason. However, on 12 July, 2012 Dominica signed an agreement with Poland to exchange tax information.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.archbip.mf.gov.pl/bip/14227.html |title=Ministerstwo Finansów |publisher=Mf.gov.pl |access-date=2013-09-29}}</ref>

=== Economic immigrants ===
{{main|Dominica citizenship by investment programme}}
The Commonwealth of Dominica offers an official and legally mandated [[economic citizenship]] to those seeking a valid second citizenship. The nationality law of Dominica authorises the government to waive the normal requirement of seven years of legal residence to acquire citizenship in exchange for an investment into their country's economy. The required contribution for a main applicant starts at US$100,000 through the Economic Diversification Fund.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://cbiu.gov.dm/investment-options/economic-diversification-fund/|title=Economic Diversification Fund - Dominica|work=Dominica|access-date=2018-11-30|language=en-US}}</ref> Alternatively, since 2014, applicants can make a US$200,000 minimum investment in pre-approved real estate from island exclusive resorts or global brands like Marriott, Kempinski or Hilton.<ref>Dominica Citizenship by Investment Unit website http://cbiu.gov.dm/</ref> According to officials, the [[citizenship by investment]] (CBI) programme was an economic and fiscal "lifeline" in the aftermath of Tropical Storm Erika in 2015 and Hurricane Maria in 2017, and its new investment option had become the main source of [[Foreign Direct Investment]] into Dominica by early 2016.<ref>[http://dominicanewsonline.com/news/homepage/news/general/dominicas-citizenship-programme-main-source-of-fdi-officials-say/ "Dominica’s Citizenship Programme 'Main Source of FDI', Officials Say"], Dominica News Online, 16 February 2016.</ref> Dominican citizens can travel without a visa, or obtain a visa upon entry, to nearly 140 countries and territories, including the United Kingdom and the Schengen Zone.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.goccp.com/ENG/travel.htm|title=Dominica Passport Visa Free Travel - Dominica Visa Free Countries|website=www.goccp.com|language=en|access-date=2018-11-30}}</ref> Applying for Dominica citizenship requires interacting with official Government Approved Economic Citizenship Agents as the first step in the application process.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://cbiu.gov.dm/citizenship/authorised-agents/|title=Authorised CBIU Agents – Government Approved CBIU Agents}}</ref> This program is currently valued at 16% of the government's total revenue.<ref>{{Cite journal|url=https://www.economist.com/international/2018/09/29/selling-citizenship-is-big-business-and-controversial|title=Selling citizenship is big business—and controversial|journal=The Economist|date=2018-09-29}}</ref>

The government's management of the economic citizenship programme and an initial perceived lack of transparency in the use of the revenues generated are a frequent topic of heated domestic political controversy. Referring to the opposition, Prime Minister Skerrit in 2016 stated that "If they can discredit the Citizenship by Investment Program and make Dominica an unattractive place to obtain citizenship, then revenues would fall and the government would not be able to rebuild the country. Or, the government would then have to increase taxes on the people; making itself unpopular in their sight."<ref>[http://dominicanewsonline.com/news/homepage/news/politics/full-speech-of-pm-skerrit-at-dlp-meeting-in-st-joseph/ "Full speech of PM Skerrit at DLP meeting in St. Joseph"], Dominica News Online, 3 February 2016.</ref> Since then, the Government of Dominica has improved transparency of CBI funds.

=== Tourism ===
Dominica is mostly volcanic and has few beaches; therefore, [[Tourism in Dominica|tourism]] has developed more slowly than on neighbouring islands. Nevertheless, Dominica's mountains, rainforests, freshwater lakes, hot springs, waterfalls, and diving spots make it an attractive [[ecotourism]] destination. Cruise ship stopovers have increased following the development of modern docking and waterfront facilities in Roseau, the capital.<ref name="bn" /> Out of 22 Caribbean islands tracked, Dominica had the fewest visitors in 2008 (55,800 or 0.3% of the total). This was about half as many as visited Haiti.<ref>{{cite news|title=Bookings started to fall along with stock market|date=19 January 2009|author1=DeLollis, Barbara|author2=Hansen, Barbara|work=USA Today}}</ref> The volcanic nature of the island has attracted [[scuba diving|scuba divers]].

== Infrastructure ==
=== Air ===
There are two regional airports on the island, but no international airports. Therefore, flying to Dominica requires travelling through [[San Juan, Puerto Rico]] or other nearby islands in the Caribbean such as [[Martinique]], [[Guadeloupe]], or [[Barbados]]. The primary airport, [[Douglas-Charles Airport]] (DOM), is on the northeast coast and is about a 45-minute drive from Portsmouth (1 hour from Roseau). The second is [[Canefield Airport]] (DCF), about 15 minutes from Roseau on the southwest coast. Douglas-Charles Airport is suitable for limited use of commercial jets because of runway length. Douglas-Charles currently has regular service by [[Air Sunshine]], [[Winair]] and [[Seaborne Airlines]] using twin turboprop aircraft like the [[ATR (aircraft manufacturer)|ATR]] and [[Saab 340]], as well as [[Conviasa]] and [[Amerijet]], which, using [[Boeing 727|Boeing 727 Freighters]], is the only airline with jet service to the republic. A runway extension and service upgrade project began at Douglas-Charles Airport around 2006 and was finished in 2010. In March 2013, airline American Eagle halted flights to the island citing high labour costs.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://dominicanewsonline.com/news/homepage/news/business/american-eagle-worries/ |title=American Eagle worries |publisher=Dominica News Online |access-date=2013-09-29}}</ref>
[[File:Petite Savanne, Dominica, after Tropical Storm Erika.jpg|thumb|left|upright=1.25|Petite Savanne ''(pictured)'' was uninhabitable after numerous landslides.]]

=== Roads ===
Dominica's road network runs primarily along the coastline and along river valleys. Major roads are two-lane highways which connect the capital, Roseau, with Portsmouth ([[Edward Oliver LeBlanc|Edward Oliver Leblanc Highway]]) and the Douglas Charles Airport (Dr. Nicholas Liverpool Highway). It takes about 45 minutes to drive from Portsmouth to Roseau. Private minibuses form the major public transport system. These major roads were reconstructed from the early 2010s to 2015 with assistance from the People's Republic of China and the European Union.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://dominicanewsonline.com/news/homepage/news/economy-development/completion-ceremony-of-edward-oliver-leblanc-highway-today/ |title=Completion ceremony of Edward Oliver Leblanc Highway Friday |publisher=Dominica News Online |access-date=2013-09-29}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://news.gov.dm/index.php/news/1948-dr-nicholas-liverpool-highway-officially-commissioned|title=Dr Nicholas Liverpool Highway Officially Commissioned |publisher=Dominica Government Information Service |access-date=2015-10-04}}</ref>

Due to [[Tropical Storm Erika#Effects in Dominica|Tropical Storm Erika of 2015]] several road surfaces and bridges were damaged by flooding and landslides, including on the just completed E.O. LeBlanc Highway (Roseau to Portsmouth) and [[Nicholas Liverpool|Dr. Nicholas Liverpool Highway]] (Pont Cassé to Douglas Charles Airport). To alleviate this, the government announced that it intended to install emergency bridges in Roseau Valley near the Trafalgar Falls to Wotten Waven and in Emshall.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://dominicanewsonline.com/news/homepage/news/business/emergency-bridges-being-developed-pm-says/|title=Emergency bridges being developed PM says |publisher=Dominica News Online |access-date=2015-10-04}}</ref> [[Hurricane Maria#Dominica|Hurricane Maria of 2017]] also damaged the road network.

=== Green energy ===
Dominica's electricity sector includes power from hydroelectricity, solar energy, and geothermal energy.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://dominicanewsonline.com/news/homepage/news/business/emergency-bridges-being-developed-pm-says/|title=Emergency Bridges Being Developed PM Says|publisher=Dominica News Online}}</ref> Following on from the devastation caused by Hurricane Maria in September 2017, the Dominican government claimed it would invest in geothermal energy. In early March 2018 Dominica signed an [[International Solar Alliance]] Framework Agreement, in an attempt to exploit solar energy to power the country with a source of renewable energy.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://renewableenergycaribbean.com/2018/08/24/dominica-cementing-its-position-as-a-renewable-energy-trailblazer/|title=Dominica cementing its position as a renewable energy trailblazer|first=Renewable Energy|last=Caribbean|date=24 August 2018|access-date=4 August 2020}}</ref>

The vast majority of Dominicans are of African descent. There is a growing mixed population along with a small European origin minority (descendants of French and British colonists along with some people of Irish descent from indentured servants) and there are small numbers of Lebanese, Syrians and Asians. Dominica is also the only Eastern Caribbean island that still has a population of pre-Columbian native [[Kalinago]] (previously called Caribs), who were exterminated or driven from neighbouring islands. {{As of|2014}} there are more than 3,000 Kalinago remaining. They live in eight villages on the east coast of Dominica. This special [[Carib Territory]] (now Kalinago Territory) was granted by the British Crown in 1903.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.avirtualdominica.com/caribs.htm |title=The Carib Indians |publisher=Avirtualdominica.com |access-date=2010-06-27}}</ref>

[[File:Scotts Head, Dominica 021.jpg|thumb|Scotts Head, Dominica]]
The population growth rate of Dominica is very low, due primarily to emigration to other countries. In the early 21st century, emigrant numbers for the most popular countries are as follows: the United States (8,560), the United Kingdom (6,739), [[Canada]] (605), and France (394).

Dominica had a relatively large number of [[centenarian]]s. In March 2007 there were 22 centenarians out of the island's 70,000 inhabitants —three times the average incidence of centenarianism in developed countries. The reasons for this were once the subject of a study that formerly had been undertaken at [[Ross University School of Medicine]].<ref name=FOOC>Pickford, John ''From Our Own Correspondent'' BBC Radio 4. First broadcast 31 March 2007. Dominica report 17'49" – 22'55"</ref>

Dominica was partially integrated into the federal colony of the [[Leeward Islands]] in 1832. Later, in 1871, it became a full part of the Federation of the Leeward Islands. From the start it was a peculiar relationship for previously Dominica had played no part in the political or cultural traditions of the other more Anglophone islands of the federation. Now, as a Leeward Island, this much larger territory, with thousands of acres of forested unclaimed land, was open to the people of [[Montserrat]] and [[Antigua]]. At the beginning of the 20th century, the Rose's Company, which produced [[Rose's lime juice]], saw demand for its product outgrow its ability to supply the product from Montserrat. Their response to the situation was to buy land on Dominica and encourage Montserrat farm labourers to relocate. As a result, there came to be two linguistic communities in Dominica, [[Wesley, Dominica|Wesley]] and [[Marigot, Dominica|Marigot]].

In 1902, on 8 May, the [[Mount Pelée]] volcano on Martinique erupted destroying the city of [[Saint-Pierre, Martinique|Saint-Pierre]]. Refugees from Martinique arrived in boats to the southern villages of Dominica and some remained permanently on the island.

=== Languages ===
[[English language|English]] is the official language of Dominica and is universally spoken and understood. In addition, [[Dominican Creole]], an [[Antillean Creole]] based on [[French language|French]], is widely spoken. This is due to French migration to the island starting in 1690, a majority French Creole speaking population that resided on the island,<ref>{{cite book|last1=Honychurch|first1=Lennox|title=The Dominica story : a history of the island|date=1995|publisher=Macmillan|location=London|isbn=978-0333627761|pages=49–60|edition= 3rd}}</ref> and its location between the two French-speaking departments of [[Martinique]] and [[Guadeloupe]]. Since 1979, Dominica has been a member of [[La Francophonie]]. Dominican Creole is particularly used among the older generation, which also speaks a [[patois]] language. Because of a decline in the use of Creole by the younger generation, initiatives have been set up in an effort to increase usage and promote this unique part of the nation's history and culture.

Along with Creole, a dialect known as Kokoy (or Cockoy) is spoken.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/reader/0521710162/ref=sib_dp_pt#reader-link|title=Lesser-known varieties of English|year=2010|publisher=Cambridge University Press|display-authors=etal|author=Schreier, D|isbn=9780521710169}}</ref> It is a type of [[List of English-based pidgins|pidgin English]] which is a mix of Leeward Island [[English Creole]] and Dominican Creole,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.avirtualdominica.com/creole.htm|title=Creole for Beginners|publisher=Avirtualdominica.com|access-date=2010-06-27}}</ref> and is mainly spoken in the north-eastern villages of Marigot and Wesley, by the descendants of immigrants from [[Montserrat]] and [[Antigua]]. Over time there has been much intermarrying, but there are still traces of difference in origin.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.lennoxhonychurch.com/article.cfm?id=402|title=Migration from Montserrat to Dominica|publisher=Lennoxhonychurch.com|access-date=2010-06-27|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110511073901/http://www.lennoxhonychurch.com/article.cfm?id=402|archive-date=11 May 2011}}</ref> As a result of this mixture of languages and heritage, Dominica is a member of both the French-speaking Francophonie and the English-speaking [[Commonwealth of Nations]].

[[Island Carib language|Island Carib]], also known as Igneri (Iñeri, Igñeri, Inyeri), was an [[Arawakan language]] historically spoken by the [[Island Caribs]] of the [[Lesser Antilles]] in the [[Caribbean]]. The Island Caribs lived throughout the southern Lesser Antilles such as Dominica, [[Saint Vincent and the Grenadines|St Vincent]] and [[Trinidad and Tobago|Trinidad]], supposedly having conquered them from their previous inhabitants, the [[Igneri]]. Island Carib became extinct about 1920, but an offshoot survives as [[Garifuna language|Garifuna]], primarily in Central America.

=== Education ===
{{main|Education in Dominica}}
{{More citations needed section|date=February 2016}}
School in Dominica is mandatory up to secondary school. After pre-school, pupils attend primary school for six or seven years, and are admitted into secondary school on the basis of a Common Entrance Exam. After five years the students take the General Certificate of Education (GCE), widely replaced by the current Caribbean Secondary Education Certificate administered by the Caribbean Examination Council (a 15-member confederation of the Caribbean community (CARICOM). The more advanced version of this examination, CAPE, can be taken upon completion of two years of community college. The island has its own [[Dominica State College]], formerly named Clifton Dupigny Community College. Some Dominicans attend universities in Cuba on scholarships offered by its government; others go to the [[University of the West Indies]] or to universities in the United Kingdom, the United States, or other countries.

The Dominica Library and Information Service serves an integral role in the education of the citizens of the country. The creation of a public library in Dominica did not come easily though the impetus was a noble one that would help "the coloured people... [improve] their lot as they moved along the path to complete freedom...” (Boromé, 203). The Dominican library began as a reading room that would evolve into a free and public library that wasn't fully free: patrons were required to pay a subscription fee. Surviving religious and political discord, the great depression, and two world wars, the library finally came under the care of the government where funds were set aside for its upkeep. Ironically, the early stages of the library's history were dedicated to remove the "uncouth", and "barbarous patois", which today is being preserved. However, it did achieve its goal of "diminishing the island’s very high percentage of illiteracy" (pg. 225).<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Boromé|first=Joseph A.|date=1970|title=Origin and Growth of the Public Libraries of Dominica|journal=The Journal of Library History |volume=5|issue=3|pages=200–236|jstor=25540240|issn=0022-2259}}</ref> However, the historical library was demolished in the wake on hurricane Maria in 2018, and slated to be rebuilt with a more modern outlook.

== Culture ==
{{main|Culture of Dominica|Music of Dominica}}
[[File:Carib Territory.svg|thumb|left|Dominica's east coast [[Carib Territory]]]]

Dominica is home to a wide range of people. Although it was historically occupied by several native tribes, the [[Arawak peoples|Arawaks]] (Tainos) and Carib (Kalinago) tribes occupied it at the time European settlers reached the island. "[[Massacre River (Dominica)|Massacre]]" is a name of a river dedicated to the [[Kalinago Genocide of 1626|mass murder of the native villagers]] by English settlers on St. Kitts -the survivors were forced into exile on Dominica.<ref name=Hubbard>{{cite book|last1=Hubbard|first1=Vincent|title=A History of St. Kitts|date=2002|publisher=Macmillan Caribbean|isbn=9780333747605|page=[https://archive.org/details/historyofstkitts00vinc/page/17 17]|url-access=registration|url=https://archive.org/details/historyofstkitts00vinc/page/17}}</ref> Both the French and British tried to claim the island and imported [[slaves]] from Africa for labour. The remaining Caribs now live on a {{convert|3700|acre|km2|0|adj=on}} territory on the east coast of the island. They elect their own chief. This mix of cultures has produced the current culture.{{Original research inline|date=February 2021}}

Music and dance are important facets of Dominica's culture. The annual independence celebrations display a variety of traditional song and dance. Since 1997, there have also been weeks of Creole festivals, such as "Creole in the Park" and the "[[World Creole Music Festival]]".

Dominica gained prominence on the international music stage when in 1973, [[Gordon Henderson (musician)|Gordon Henderson]] founded the group [[Exile One]] and an original musical genre, which he coined "[[Cadence-lypso]]". This paved the way for modern Creole music. Other musical genres include "[[Jing ping]]" and "[[Cadence rampa|Cadence]]". Jing ping features the accordion and is native to the island. Dominica's music is a mélange of Haitian, Afro-Cuban, African and European traditions. Popular artists over the years include Chubby and the Midnight Groovers, Bells Combo, the Gaylords, [[Windward Caribbean Kulture|WCK]], and Triple Kay.

The 11th annual World [[creole music|Creole Music]] Festival was held in 2007, part of the island's celebration of independence from Great Britain on 3 November. A year-long reunion celebration began in January 2008, marking 30 years of independence.

Dominica is often seen as a society that is migrating from [[collectivism]] to that of individualism. The economy is a developing one that previously depended on agriculture. Signs of collectivism are evident in the small towns and villages which are spread across the island.{{clarify|date=February 2020}}

The novelist [[Jean Rhys]] was born and raised in Dominica. The island is obliquely depicted in her best-known book, ''[[Wide Sargasso Sea]]''. Rhys's friend, the political activist and writer [[Phyllis Shand Allfrey]], set her 1954 novel, ''[[The Orchid House (novel)|The Orchid House]]'', in Dominica.

Much of the [[Walt Disney Pictures|Walt Disney]] film ''[[Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest]]'' (the second in the series, released in 2006), was shot on location on Dominica (though in the film it was known as "Pelegosto", a fictional island), along with some shooting for the third film in the series, ''[[Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End|At World's End]]'' (2007).

=== Cuisine ===
{{main|Dominica cuisine}}

Dominica's cuisine is similar to that of other Caribbean islands, particularly Jamaica, Saint Lucia and Trinidad and Tobago. Like other [[Commonwealth Caribbean]] islands, Dominicans have developed a distinct twist to their cuisine. Breakfast is an important daily meal, typically including saltfish, dried and salted [[codfish]], and "bakes" (fried dough). Saltfish and bakes are combined for a fast food snack that can be eaten throughout the day; vendors on Dominica's streets sell these snacks to passersby, together with fried chicken, fish and fruit and yogurt "smoothies". Other breakfast meals include cornmeal [[porridge]], which is made with fine cornmeal or ''polenta'', milk or condensed milk, and sugar to sweeten. Traditional British-influenced dishes, such as eggs, bacon and toast, are also popular, as are fried fish and [[Plantain (cooking)|plantains]].

Common vegetables include [[Plantain (cooking)|plantains]], tanias (a root vegetable), [[sweet potatoes]], [[potatoes]], [[rice and peas]]. Meat and poultry typically eaten include chicken, beef and fish. These are often prepared in stews with onions, carrots, garlic, ginger and herbs. The vegetables and meat are browned to create a rich dark sauce. Popular meals include rice and peas, [[brown stew chicken]], stew beef, fried and stewed fish, and many different types of hearty fish broths and soups. These are filled with dumplings, carrots and ground provisions.

=== Sports ===
[[Cricket]] is a popular sport on the island, and Dominica competes in [[test cricket]] as part of the [[West Indies cricket team]]. In West Indies domestic first-class cricket, Dominica participates as part of the [[Windward Islands cricket team]], although they are often considered a part of the [[Leeward Islands]] geographically. This is due to being part of the [[British Windward Islands]] colony from 1940 until independence; its cricket federation remains a part of the Windward Islands Cricket Board of Control.

On 24 October, 2007, the 8,000-seat [[Windsor Park (Dominica)|Windsor cricket stadium]] was completed with a donation of [[EC$]]33&nbsp;million ([[US$]]17&nbsp;million, [[euro|€]]12&nbsp;million) from the [[government of the People's Republic of China]].

[[Netball]], [[basketball]], [[Rugby football|rugby]], [[tennis]] and [[association football]] are gaining popularity as well.

During the [[2014 Winter Olympics]], a husband and wife team of Gary di Silvestri and Angela Morrone di Silvestri spent [[US$]]175,000 to register as Dominican citizens and enter the 15&nbsp;km men's and 10&nbsp;km women's [[Cross-country skiing at the 2014 Winter Olympics|cross-country skiing]] events, respectively. Angela did not start her race, and Gary pulled out several hundred meters into his race. To date, they are Dominica's only Winter Olympic athletes.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://deadspin.com/dominicas-fake-ski-team-scammed-the-olympics-and-the-p-1529973935|title=Dominica's Fake Ski Team Scammed The Olympics and the Press|date=2014-02-24|publisher=Deadspin|author=McKenna, Dave|access-date=2014-02-25}}</ref>

Athlete [[Jérôme Romain]] won the bronze medal at the [[1995 World Championships in Athletics]] [[1995 World Championships in Athletics – Men's triple jump|triple jump competition]]. He also qualified for the finals at the [[Athletics at the 1996 Summer Olympics – Men's triple jump|1996 Olympic Games]]; even though he had to pull out due to injury, his 12th position is the best performance of a Dominican ever at the [[Olympic Games|Olympics]].

== Media ==
Dominica has two major newspapers, ''The Sun'' and ''[[The Chronicle (Dominica)|The Chronicle]]''. There are two national television stations and a few radio stations, including Stations include: ZBC-AM 590, the first private local radio station is called Radio En Ba Mango 93.5/96.9FM in the Village of Berricoa Grand Bay and is owned by Urban Dangleben, ZGBC-AM 740, ZGBC-FM 90.7 (Portsmouth), ZGBC-FM 102.1 (Roseau) and ZGBC-FM 106.1 (Marigot), Q95 FM,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://wiceqfm.com/index.html |title=Q95 FM |publisher=Wiceqfm.com |access-date=2010-06-27}}</ref> the [[Dominica Broadcasting Corporation]], and Kairi FM.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.kairifm.com/ |title=Kairi FM |publisher=Kairi FM |access-date=2010-06-27}}</ref> Before 2004, there were two telecommunication companies [[Cable and Wireless (Caribbean)|Cable and Wireless]] and [[Marpin TV]]<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.marpin2k4.com/cgi-sys/suspendedpage.cgi|title=Account Suspended|website=www.marpin2k4.com|access-date=4 August 2020}}</ref> founded by Dominican, Ronald Bernard Maroni Abraham. In 2005, [[Digicel]] and a UK-based company [[Orange SA|Orange]] started to offer service to the island. There are a number of mobile networks operating on the island; LIME and Digicel compete for most of Dominica's wireless customers. Orange shut down in 2010 and is no longer operating on the island of Dominica.

Historical newspapers include [https://dloc.com/AA00079438/00001 ''The Dominican''],  [https://dloc.com/AA00079437/00003/allvolumes ''The Dominica Guardian''], and the [https://dloc.com/AA00079447/00564/allvolumes ''Dominica Colonist''], available for free in the [[Digital Library of the Caribbean]].

The origins of the [[Roman Empire|Roman]] name ''[[Hispania]]'', and the modern ''España'', are uncertain, although the Phoenicians and Carthaginians referred to the region as ''Spania'', therefore the most widely accepted etymology is a [[Semitic languages|Semitic]]-[[Phoenician language|Phoenician]] one.<ref name="historiaclasica.com" /><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.abc.es/espana/20140829/abci-donde-procede-palabra-espana-201408281811.html|title="I-span-ya", el misterioso origen de la palabra España|last=ABC|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161113170715/http://www.abc.es/espana/20140829/abci-donde-procede-palabra-espana-201408281811.html|archive-date=13 November 2016}}</ref> There have been a number of accounts and hypotheses of its origin:

The [[Renaissance]] scholar [[Antonio de Nebrija]] proposed that the word ''Hispania'' evolved from the [[Iberian language|Iberian]] word ''[[Hispalis]]'', meaning "city of the western world".

{{ILL|Jesús Luis Cunchillos|es}} argued that the root of the term ''span'' is the [[Phoenician language|Phoenician]] word ''spy'', meaning "to forge metals".

''Hispania'' may derive from the poetic use of the term ''[[Hesperia (mythology)|Hesperia]]'', reflecting the [[Ancient Greece|Greek]] perception of Italy as a "western land" or "land of the setting sun" (''Hesperia'', ''Ἑσπερία'' in [[Greek language|Greek]]) and Spain, being still further west, as ''Hesperia ultima''.<ref name=anthon>{{cite book|last = Anthon

There is the claim that "Hispania" derives from the [[Basque language|Basque]] word ''Ezpanna'' meaning "edge" or "border", another reference to the fact that the Iberian Peninsula constitutes the southwest corner of the European continent.<ref name=anthon />

Two 15th-century Spanish Jewish scholars, [[Isaac Abravanel|Don Isaac Abravanel]] and [[Solomon ibn Verga]], gave an explanation now considered folkloric. Both men wrote in two different published works that the first Jews to reach Spain were brought by ship by Phiros who was confederate with the king of Babylon when he laid siege to Jerusalem. Phiros was a [[Greeks|Grecian]] by birth, but who had been given a kingdom in Spain. Phiros became related by marriage to Espan, the nephew of king Heracles, who also ruled over a kingdom in Spain. Heracles later renounced his throne in preference for his native Greece, leaving his kingdom to his nephew, Espan, from whom the country of ''España'' (Spain) took its name. Based upon their testimonies, this eponym would have already been in use in Spain by c. 350 BCE.<ref>Abrabanel, ''Commentary on the First Prophets'' (''Pirush Al Nevi'im Rishonim''), end of II Kings, pp. 680–681, Jerusalem 1955 (Hebrew).

Iberia enters written records as a land populated largely by the [[Iberians]], [[Basques]] and [[Celts]]. Early on its coastal areas were settled by [[Phoenicians]] who founded Western Europe's most ancient cities [[Cádiz]] and [[Málaga]]. Phoenician influence expanded as much of the Peninsula was eventually incorporated into the [[Carthaginian Empire]], becoming a major theatre of the [[Punic Wars]] against the expanding [[Roman Empire]]. After an [[Roman conquest of Hispania|arduous conquest]], the peninsula came fully under [[Hispania|Roman rule]]. During the early Middle Ages it came under [[Visigothic Kingdom|Visigothic]] rule, and then much of it was conquered by [[Muslim]] invaders from [[North Africa]]. In a [[Reconquista|process that took centuries]], the small Christian kingdoms in the north gradually regained control of the peninsula. The last Muslim state [[Fall of Granada|fell in 1492]], the same year Columbus reached the Americas. A [[Spanish Empire|global empire]] began which saw Spain become the strongest kingdom in Europe, the leading world power for one and a half  centuries, and the largest overseas empire for three centuries.

Continued wars and other problems eventually led to a diminished status. The [[Peninsular War|Napoleonic conflict in Spain]] led to chaos, triggering independence movements that tore apart most of the empire and left the country politically unstable. Spain suffered a devastating [[Spanish Civil War|civil war]] in the 1930s and then came under the rule of an [[Francoist Spain|authoritarian government]], which oversaw a period of stagnation that was followed by a surge in the growth of the economy. Eventually, democracy was [[Spanish transition to democracy|restored]] in the form of a parliamentary constitutional monarchy. Spain joined the European Union, experiencing a cultural renaissance and steady economic growth until the beginning of the 21st century, that started a new globalised world with economic and ecological challenges.

The largest groups inhabiting the Iberian Peninsula before the Roman conquest were the [[Iberians]] and the [[Celts]]. The Iberians inhabited the Mediterranean side of the peninsula, from the northeast to the southeast. The Celts inhabited much of the inner and Atlantic sides of the peninsula, from the northwest to the southwest. [[Basque people|Basques]] occupied the western area of the Pyrenees mountain range and adjacent areas, the Phoenician-influenced [[Tartessos|Tartessians]] culture flourished in the southwest and the [[Lusitanians]] and [[Vettones]] occupied areas in the central west. Several cities were founded along the coast by [[Phoenicia]]ns, and trading outposts and colonies were established by [[Greek colonies|Greeks]] in the East.

The weakening of the Western Roman Empire's jurisdiction in Hispania began in 409, when the [[Germanic peoples|Germanic]] [[Suebi]] and [[Vandals]], together with the [[Sarmatian]] [[Alans]] entered the peninsula at the invitation of a Roman usurper. These tribes had crossed the [[Rhine]] in early 407 and ravaged [[Gaul]]. The Suebi established a kingdom in what is today modern [[Galicia (Spain)|Galicia]] and northern [[Portugal]] whereas the Vandals established themselves in southern Spain by 420 before crossing over to North Africa in 429 and [[Battle of Carthage (439)|taking]] Carthage in 439. As the western empire disintegrated, the social and economic base became greatly simplified: but even in modified form, the successor regimes maintained many of the institutions and laws of the late empire, including Christianity and assimilation to the evolving Roman culture.

[[File:Corona de (29049230050).jpg|thumb|left|upright=0.6|[[Votive crown]] of [[Reccesuinth]] from the [[Treasure of Guarrazar]]]]
The [[Byzantine]]s established an occidental province, [[Spania]], in the south, with the intention of reviving Roman rule throughout Iberia. Eventually, however, Hispania was reunited under [[Visigothic Kingdom|Visigothic rule]]. These [[Visigoths]], or Western Goths, after [[Sack of Rome (410)|sacking Rome]] under the leadership of [[Alaric I|Alaric]] (410), turned towards the [[Iberian Peninsula]], with [[Athaulf]] for their leader, and occupied the northeastern portion. [[Wallia]] extended his rule over most of the peninsula, keeping the Suebians shut up in Galicia. [[Theodoric I]] took part, with the Romans and Franks, in the [[Battle of the Catalaunian Plains]], where [[Attila]] was routed. [[Euric]] (466), who put an end to the last remnants of Roman power in the peninsula, may be considered the first monarch of Spain, though the Suebians still maintained their independence in Galicia. Euric was also the first king to give written laws to the Visigoths. In the following reigns the Catholic kings of France assumed the role of protectors of the Hispano-Roman Catholics against the Arianism of the Visigoths, and in the [[Franco-Visigothic Wars|wars]] which ensued [[Alaric II]] and [[Amalaric]] lost their lives.

[[Athanagild]], having risen against King [[Agila]], called in the Byzantines and, in payment for the succour they gave him, ceded to them the maritime places of the southeast (554). [[Liuvigild]] restored the political unity of the peninsula, subduing the Suebians, but the religious divisions of the country, reaching even the royal family, brought on a civil war. [[St. Hermengild]], the king's son, putting himself at the head of the Catholics, was defeated and taken prisoner, and suffered martyrdom for rejecting communion with the Arians. [[Recared]], son of Liuvigild and brother of St. Hermengild, added religious unity to the political unity achieved by his father, accepting the Catholic faith in the [[Third Council of Toledo]] (589). The religious unity established by this council was the basis of that fusion of Goths with Hispano-Romans which produced the Spanish nation. [[Sisebut]] and [[Suintila]] completed the expulsion of the Byzantines from Spain.<ref name=Spain>{{CathEncy|wstitle=Spain}}</ref>

Intermarriage between Visigoths and Hispano-Romans was prohibited, though in practice it could not be entirely prevented and was eventually legalised by Liuvigild.<ref>{{cite book |title=A History of Portugal and the Portuguese Empire: Volume 1, Portugal: From Beginnings to 1807 |date=2009 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |isbn=978-1-107-71764-0}}</ref> The Spanish-Gothic scholars such as [[Braulio of Zaragoza]] and [[Isidore of Seville]] played an important role in keeping the classical [[Greco-Roman world|Greek and Roman culture]].

In the 8th century, nearly all of the [[Iberian Peninsula]] was [[Umayyad conquest of Hispania|conquered]] (711–718) by largely [[Moorish]] [[Muslim]] armies from North Africa. These conquests were part of the expansion of the [[Umayyad Caliphate]]. Only a small area in the mountainous north-west of the peninsula managed to resist the initial invasion.<!--See next section on the Reconquista: citation not needed here--> Legend has it that [[Julian, Count of Ceuta|Count Julian]], the governor of Ceuta, in revenge for the violation of his daughter, [[Florinda la Cava|Florinda]], by King [[Roderic]], invited the Muslims and opened to them the gates of the peninsula.

Under [[Sharia|Islamic law]], Christians and [[Jews]] were given the subordinate status of [[dhimmi]]. This status permitted Christians and Jews to practice their religions as ''[[People of the Book]]'' but they were required to pay a special tax and had legal and social rights inferior to those of Muslims.<ref>{{cite book|author=H.

Conversion to [[Islam]] proceeded at an increasing pace. The ''[[Muwallad|muladíes]]'' (Muslims of ethnic [[Iberian Peninsula|Iberian]] origin) are believed to have formed the majority of the population of Al-Andalus by the end of the 10th century.<ref>[http://libro.uca.edu/ics/ics5.htm Islamic and Christian Spain in the Early Middle Ages.

In the 11th century, the Muslim holdings fractured into rival [[Taifa]] states (Arab, Berber, and Slav),<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=3RtpCgAAQBAJ&pg=PA237|title=Handbook of Medieval Culture|first=Albrecht|last=Classen|date=31 August 2015|publisher=Walter de Gruyter GmbH & Co KG|via=Google Books|isbn=9783110267303}}</ref> allowing the small Christian states the opportunity to greatly enlarge their territories.<ref name="chap2" /> The arrival from North Africa of the Islamic ruling sects of the [[Almoravids]] and the [[Almohads]] restored unity upon the Muslim holdings, with a stricter, less tolerant application of Islam, and saw a revival in Muslim fortunes. This re-united Islamic state experienced more than a century of successes that partially reversed Christian gains.

The ''[[Reconquista]]'' (Reconquest) was the centuries-long period in which Christian rule was re-established over the Iberian Peninsula. The Reconquista is viewed as beginning with the [[Battle of Covadonga]] won by [[Pelagius of Asturias|Don Pelayo]] in 722 and was concurrent with the period of Muslim rule on the Iberian Peninsula. The Christian army's victory over Muslim forces led to the creation of the Christian [[Kingdom of Asturias]] along the northwestern coastal mountains. Shortly after, in 739, Muslim forces were driven from [[Galicia (Spain)|Galicia]], which was to eventually host one of medieval Europe's holiest sites, [[Santiago de Compostela]] and was incorporated into the new Christian kingdom.

The [[Kingdom of León]] was the strongest Christian kingdom for centuries. In 1188 the first modern parliamentary session in Europe was held in [[León (Spain)|León]] ([[Cortes of León]]). The [[Kingdom of Castile]], formed from Leonese territory, was its successor as strongest kingdom. The kings and the nobility fought for power and influence in this period. The example of the Roman emperors influenced the political objective of the Crown, while the nobles benefited from [[feudalism]].

Muslim armies had also moved north of the Pyrenees but they were defeated by Frankish forces at the [[Battle of Tours|Battle of Poitiers]], [[Francia|Frankia]] and pushed out of the very southernmost region of France along the seacoast by the 760s. Later, [[Franks|Frankish]] forces established [[Marca Hispanica|Christian counties]] on the southern side of the Pyrenees.

The [[Transmission of the Classics|Islamic transmission of the classics]] is the main [[Islamic contributions to Medieval Europe]]. The [[Old Spanish|Castilian]] language—more commonly known (especially later in history and at present) as "Spanish" after becoming the national language and ''[[lingua franca]]'' of Spain—evolved from [[Vulgar Latin]], as did other [[Romance languages]] of Spain like the [[Old Catalan|Catalan]], [[Astur-Leonese|Asturian]] and [[Galician-Portuguese|Galician]] languages, as well as other Romance languages in Latin Europe. [[Basque language|Basque]], the only non-Romance language in Spain, continued evolving from Early Basque to Medieval. The ''[[Glosas Emilianenses]]'' (found at the [[Monasteries of San Millán de la Cogolla]] and written in Latin, Basque and Romance) hold a great value as one of the first written examples of Iberian Romance.<ref>{{Cite journal|page=90|url=http://erevistas.uca.edu.ar/index.php/LET/article/view/1774|journal=Letras|issn=0326-3363|publisher=[[Pontifical Catholic University of Argentina|Pontificia Universidad Católica Argentina Santa María de los Buenos Aires]]|volume=2|year=2015|issue=72|title=Literatura hispanorromance primigenia : la glosa conoajutorio del Codex Aemilianensis 60|first=María de los Ángeles|last=Dapueto Reyes}}</ref>

The break-up of [[Al-Andalus]] into the competing taifa kingdoms helped the long embattled Iberian Christian kingdoms gain the initiative. The capture of the strategically central city of [[Toledo, Spain|Toledo]] in 1085 marked a significant shift in the balance of power in favour of the Christian kingdoms. Following a great Muslim resurgence in the 12th century, the great Moorish strongholds in the south fell to Castile in the 13th century—Córdoba in 1236 and [[Seville]] in 1248. The [[County of Barcelona]] and the [[Kingdom of Aragon]] entered in a dynastic union and gained territory and power in the Mediterranean. In 1229 [[Majorca]] was conquered, so was [[Valencia]] in 1238. In the 13th and 14th centuries, the [[Marinid]] dynasty of [[Morocco]] invaded and established some enclaves on the southern coast but failed in their attempt to re-establish North African rule in Iberia and were soon driven out.

From the mid 13th century, literature and philosophy started to flourish again in the Christian peninsular kingdoms, based on Roman and Gothic traditions. An important philosopher from this time is [[Ramon Llull]]. [[Abraham Cresques]] was a prominent Jewish cartographer. [[Roman law]] and its institutions were the model for the legislators. The king [[Alfonso X of Castile]] focused on strengthening this Roman and Gothic past, and also on linking the Iberian Christian kingdoms with the rest of medieval European [[Christendom]]. Alfonso worked for being elected emperor of the [[Holy Roman Empire]] and published the [[Siete Partidas]] code. The [[Toledo School of Translators]] is the name that commonly describes the group of scholars who worked together in the city of Toledo during the 12th and 13th centuries, to translate many of the philosophical and scientific works from [[Classical Arabic]], [[Ancient Greek]], and [[Biblical Hebrew|Ancient Hebrew]].

The 13th century also witnessed the [[Crown of Aragon]], centred in Spain's north east, expand its reach across islands in the Mediterranean, to [[Sicily]] and Naples.<ref>{{cite web |last=Payne |first=Stanley G. |title = A History of Spain and Portugal; Ch. 5 The Rise of Aragon-Catalonia |publisher=The Library of Iberian Resources Online |year=1973 |url=http://libro.uca.edu/payne1/spainport1.htm |access-date=9 August 2008}}</ref> Around this time the universities of [[University of Palencia|Palencia]] (1212/1263) and [[University of Salamanca|Salamanca]] (1218/1254) were established.

The Catalans and Aragonese offered themselves to the [[Byzantine Emperor]] [[Andronicus II Palaeologus]] to [[Catalan campaign in Asia Minor|fight the Turks]]. Having conquered these, they turned their arms against the Byzantines, who treacherously slew their leaders; but for this treachery, the Spaniards, under Bernard of Rocafort and Berenguer of Entenca, exacted the terrible penalty celebrated in history as "The Catalan Vengeance" and [[Battle of Halmyros|seized]] the [[Frankish Greece|Frankish]] [[Duchy of Athens]] (1311).<ref name=Spain/> The royal line of Aragon became extinct with [[Martin the Humane]], and the [[Compromise of Caspe]] gave the Crown to the [[House of Trastámara]], already reigning in Castile.

Spanish explorers brought back [[precious metal]]s, spices, luxuries, and previously unknown plants, and played a leading part in transforming the European understanding of the globe.<ref>{{cite book |last=Thomas |first=Hugh |author-link=Hugh Thomas (writer) |title = Rivers of gold: the rise of the Spanish Empire |publisher=George Weidenfeld & Nicolson |year=2003 |location=London |pages=passim|isbn=978-0-297-64563-4}}</ref> The cultural efflorescence witnessed during this period is now referred to as the [[Spanish Golden Age]]. The expansion of the empire caused immense upheaval in the Americas as the collapse of societies and empires and new diseases from Europe devastated American indigenous populations. The rise of [[humanism]], the [[Counter-Reformation]] and new geographical discoveries and conquests raised issues that were addressed by the intellectual movement now known as the [[School of Salamanca]], which developed the first modern theories of what are now known as [[international law]] and human rights. [[Juan Luis Vives]] was another prominent humanist during this period.

Spain's 16th-century maritime supremacy was demonstrated by the victory over the Ottomans at [[Battle of Lepanto|Lepanto]] in 1571, and then after the setback of the [[Spanish Armada]] in 1588, in a series of victories against [[England]] in the [[Anglo-Spanish War (1585–1604)|Anglo-Spanish War of 1585–1604]]. However, during the middle decades of the 17th century Spain's maritime power went into a long decline with mounting defeats against the [[Dutch Republic|United Provinces]] and then England; that by the 1660s it was struggling grimly to defend its overseas possessions from pirates and privateers.

The [[Protestant Reformation]] dragged the kingdom ever more deeply into the mire of religiously charged wars. The result was a country forced into ever-expanding military efforts across Europe and in the Mediterranean.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://libro.uca.edu/payne1/payne15.htm|title=The Seventeenth-Century Decline|access-date=13 August 2008|publisher=The Library of Iberian resources online|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130921003150/http://libro.uca.edu/payne1/payne15.htm|archive-date=21 September 2013}}</ref> By the middle decades of a war- and [[Great Plague of Seville|plague]]-ridden 17th-century Europe, the Spanish Habsburgs had enmeshed the country in continent-wide religious-political conflicts.

[[File:La familia de Felipe V (Van Loo).jpg|thumb|[[The Family of Philip V (1743)|The family of Philip V]]. During the [[Enlightenment in Spain]] a new royal family reigned, the [[House of Bourbon]].]]
The decline culminated in a controversy over succession to the throne which consumed the first years of the 18th century. The [[War of the Spanish Succession]] was a wide-ranging international conflict combined with a civil war, and was to cost the kingdom its European possessions and its position as one of the leading powers on the Continent.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Rinehart |first1=Robert |last2=Seeley |first2=Jo Ann Browning |title=A Country Study: Spain – Spain in Decline |publisher=Library of Congress Country Series |year=1998 |url=http://lcweb2.loc.gov/frd/cs/estoc.html |access-date=9 August 2008 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080809003309/http://lcweb2.loc.gov/frd/cs/estoc.html |archive-date=9 August 2008 }}</ref>
During this war, a new dynasty originating in France, the [[House of Bourbon|Bourbons]], was installed. Long united only by the Crown, a true Spanish state was established when the first Bourbon king, [[Philip V of Spain|Philip V]], united the crowns of Castile and Aragon into a single state, abolishing many of the old regional privileges and laws.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Rinehart |first1=Robert |last2=Seeley |first2=Jo Ann Browning |title=A Country Study: Spain – Bourbon Spain |publisher=Library of Congress Country Series |year=1998 |url=http://lcweb2.loc.gov/frd/cs/estoc.html |access-date=9 August 2008 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080809003309/http://lcweb2.loc.gov/frd/cs/estoc.html |archive-date=9 August 2008 }}</ref>

The 18th century saw a gradual recovery and an increase in prosperity through much of the empire. The new Bourbon monarchy drew on the French system of modernising the administration and the economy. [[Enlightenment in Spain|Enlightenment]] ideas began to gain ground among some of the kingdom's elite and monarchy. [[Bourbon Reforms|Bourbon reformers]] created formal disciplined militias across the Atlantic. Spain needed every hand it could take during the seemingly endless wars of the eighteenth century—the Spanish War of Succession or [[Queen Anne's War]] (1702–13), the [[War of Jenkins' Ear]] (1739–42) which became the [[War of the Austrian Succession]] (1740–48), the [[Seven Years' War]] (1756–63) and the [[Spain and the American Revolutionary War|Anglo-Spanish War]] (1779–83)—and its new disciplined militias served around the Atlantic as needed.

=== Liberalism and nation state ===
{{Main|Mid-19th-century Spain|Spanish American wars of independence|Spanish–American War|Anarchism in Spain|Spanish Second Republic}}
[[File:Rafael Riego.jpg|thumb|right|[[Rafael del Riego]] led the anti-absolutist uprising that started the [[Trienio Liberal]], part of the [[Revolutions of 1820]] in Europe. When absolutists took power again, he was executed.]] 
In 1793, Spain went to war against the revolutionary new [[First French Republic|French Republic]] as a member of [[War of the First Coalition|the first Coalition]]. The subsequent [[War of the Pyrenees]] polarised the country in a reaction against the [[Francization|gallicised]] elites and following defeat in the field, peace was made with France in 1795 at the [[Peace of Basel]] in which Spain lost control over two-thirds of the island of [[Hispaniola]]. The Prime Minister, [[Manuel Godoy, Prince of the Peace|Manuel Godoy]], then ensured that Spain allied herself with France in the brief [[War of the Third Coalition]] which ended with the British naval victory at the [[Battle of Trafalgar]] in 1805. In 1807, a secret treaty between Napoleon and the unpopular prime minister led to a new declaration of war against Britain and Portugal. Napoleon's troops entered the country to invade Portugal but instead occupied Spain's major fortresses. The Spanish king abdicated in favour of [[Napoleon I of France|Napoleon's]] brother, [[Joseph Bonaparte]].

Joseph Bonaparte was seen as a [[puppet monarch]] and was regarded with scorn by the Spanish. The [[Dos de Mayo Uprising|2 May 1808 revolt]] was one of many nationalist uprisings across the country against the Bonapartist regime.<ref>David A. Bell. "[https://archive.today/20120922013528/http://www.historynet.com/wars_conflicts/napoleonic_wars/6361907.html?page=2&c=y Napoleon's Total War]". TheHistoryNet.com</ref> These revolts marked the beginning of a devastating [[Peninsular War|war of independence]] against the Napoleonic regime.<ref>(Gates 2001, p.20)</ref> The most celebrated battles of this war were those of [[Battles of El Bruch|Bruch]], in the highlands of Montserrat, in which the Catalan peasantry routed a French army; [[Battle of Bailén|Bailén]], where [[Francisco Javier Castaños, 1st Duke of Bailén|Castaños]], at the head of the army of Andalusia, defeated [[Pierre Dupont de l'Étang|Dupont]]; and the sieges of [[Second Siege of Zaragoza|Zaragoza]] and [[Third Siege of Girona|Girona]], which were worthy of the ancient Spaniards of [[Siege of Saguntum|Saguntum]] and [[Siege of Numantia|Numantia]].<ref name=Spain/>

Napoleon was forced to intervene personally, defeating several Spanish armies and forcing a British army to retreat. However, further military action by Spanish armies, [[guerrilla]]s and [[Arthur Wellesley, 1st Duke of Wellington|Wellington's]] British-Portuguese forces, combined with Napoleon's disastrous [[Napoleon's Invasion of Russia|invasion of Russia]], led to the ousting of the French imperial armies from Spain in 1814, and the return of [[Ferdinand VII of Spain|King Ferdinand VII]].<ref>(Gates 2001, p.467)</ref>

During the war, in 1810, a revolutionary body, the [[Cortes of Cádiz]], was assembled to co-ordinate the effort against the Bonapartist regime and to prepare a constitution.<ref>{{cite book|author=Jaime Alvar Ezquerra|title=Diccionario de historia de España|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=l4JQIkW1yrsC&pg=PA209|year=2001|publisher=[[Ediciones Akal]]|isbn=978-84-7090-366-3|page=209}} Cortes of Cádiz (1812) was the first parliament of Spain with sovereign power</ref> It met as one body, and its members represented the entire Spanish empire.<ref>{{cite book|title=Independence of Spanish America|last=Rodríguez|publisher=Cambridge University Press|url=https://www.google.es/search?tbm=bks&hl=es&q=%22It+met+as+one+body%2C+and+its+members+represented+the+entire+Spanish+world%22&btnG=|quote=It met as one body, and its members represented the entire Spanish world}}</ref> In 1812, a [[Spanish Constitution of 1812|constitution]] for universal representation under a constitutional monarchy was declared, but after the fall of the Bonapartist regime, [[Ferdinand VII]] dismissed the Cortes Generales and was determined to rule as an [[Absolute monarchy|absolute monarch]]. These events foreshadowed the conflict between conservatives and liberals in the 19th and early 20th centuries.

Spain's conquest by France benefited Latin American anti-colonialists who resented the Imperial Spanish government's policies that favoured Spanish-born citizens ([[Peninsulars]]) over those born overseas ([[Criollo people|Criollos]]) and demanded [[retroversion of the sovereignty to the people]]. Starting in 1809 Spain's American colonies began a series of revolutions and declared independence, leading to the [[Spanish American wars of independence]] that ended Spanish control over its mainland colonies in the Americas. King Ferdinand VII's attempt to [[Reconquista (Spanish America)|re-assert control]] proved futile as he faced opposition not only in the colonies but also in Spain and [[Ferdinand VII of Spain#Revolt|army revolts]] followed, led by liberal officers. By the end of 1826, the only American colonies Spain held were [[Cuba]] and [[Puerto Rico]].

The Napoleonic War left Spain economically ruined, deeply divided and politically unstable. In the 1830s and 1840s, [[Carlism]] (a reactionary legitimist movement supportive of the branch issued from [[Infante Carlos, Count of Molina|Carlos María Isidro of Bourbon]], younger brother of Ferdinand VII), fought against the [[Christinos|''cristinos'']] or ''isabelinos'' (supportive of Queen [[Isabella II of Spain|Isabella II]], daughter of Ferdinand VII) in the [[Carlist Wars]]. ''Isabelline'' forces prevailed, but the conflict between [[Progressive Party (Spain)|''progressives'']] and ''[[Moderate Party (Spain)|moderates]]'' ended in a weak early constitutional period. After the [[Glorious Revolution (Spain)|Glorious Revolution]] of 1868 and the short-lived [[First Spanish Republic]], the latter yielded to a stable monarchic period, the [[Restoration (Spain)|Restoration]], a rigid bipartisan regime fuelled up by the ''[[Turno|turnismo]]'' (the prearranged rotation of government control between liberals and conservatives) and the form of political representation at the countryside (based on [[clientelism]]) known as {{ill|caciquismo (Spain)|es|Caciquismo (España)|lt=''caciquismo''}}.<ref>{{Cite book|chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=eX7cXu4N2AUC&pg=PA33|page=33|title=Elecciones y cultura política en España e Italia (1890–1923)|editor-first=Rosa Ana|editor-last=Gutiérrez|editor-first2=Rafael|editor-last2=Zurita|editor-first3=Renato|editor-last3=Camurri|publisher=[[University of Valencia|Universitat de València]]|location=Valencia|year=2003|isbn=84-370-5672-1|chapter=Caciquismo y mundo rural durante la Restauración|first=Salvador|last=Cruz Artacho}}</ref>

In the late 19th century nationalist movements arose in the Philippines and Cuba. In 1895 and 1896 the [[Cuban War of Independence]] and the [[Philippine Revolution]] broke out and eventually<!--For whatever reasons; it is not for here to go into long explanations!--> the United States became involved. The [[Spanish–American War]] was fought in the spring of 1898 and resulted in Spain losing the last of its once vast colonial empire outside of North Africa. ''El Desastre'' (the Disaster), as the war became known in Spain, gave added impetus to the [[Generation of '98]] who were analyzing the country.

Although the period around the turn of the century was one of increasing prosperity, the 20th century brought little social peace; Spain played a minor part in the [[scramble for Africa]], with the colonisation of [[Western Sahara]], [[Spanish Morocco]] and [[Equatorial Guinea]]. It remained neutral during World War I (see [[Spain in World War I]]). The heavy losses suffered during the [[Rif War (1920)|Rif War]] in Morocco brought discredit to the government and undermined the monarchy.

Industrialisation, the development of railways and incipient capitalism developed in several areas of the country, particularly in [[Barcelona]], as well as [[Labour movement]] and socialist and anarchist ideas. The [[1888 Barcelona Universal Exposition]] and the [[1870 Barcelona Labour Congress]] are good examples of this. In 1879, [[Spanish Socialist Workers' Party]] is founded. Linked trade union to this party, [[Unión General de Trabajadores]], was founded in 1888. In the anarcho-sindicalist trend of the labour movement in Spain, [[Confederación Nacional del Trabajo]] was founded in 1910 and [[Federación Anarquista Ibérica]] in 1927.

Catalanism and vasquism, alongside other nationalisms and regionalisms in Spain, arose in that period, being the [[Basque Nationalist Party]] formed in 1895 and [[Regionalist League of Catalonia]] in 1901.

Political corruption and repression weakened the democratic system of the constitutional monarchy of a two-parties system.<ref>{{cite book |title=Oligarquía y caciquismo, Colectivismo agrario y otros escritos: (Antología)|last=Costa|first=Joaquín|author-link=Joaquín Costa}}</ref> The [[Tragic Week (Spain)|Tragic Week]] events and repression examples the social instability of the time.

After a period of dictatorship during the governments of Generals [[Miguel Primo de Rivera]] and [[Dámaso Berenguer]] and Admiral [[Juan Bautista Aznar-Cabañas|Aznar-Cabañas]] (1923–1931), the first elections since 1923, largely understood as a plebiscite on Monarchy, took place: the [[1931 Spanish local elections|12 April 1931 municipal elections]]. These gave a resounding victory to the Republican-Socialist candidacies in large cities and provincial capitals, with a majority of monarchist councilors in rural areas. The king left the country and the proclamation of the Republic on 14 April ensued, with the formation of a provisional government.

A [[Spanish Constitution of 1931|constitution]] for the country was passed in October 1931 following the [[1931 Spanish general election|June 1931 Constituent general election]], and a series of cabinets presided by [[Manuel Azaña]] supported by republican parties and the [[Spanish Socialist Workers' Party|PSOE]] followed. In the election held in 1933 the right triumphed and in 1936, the left. During the [[Second Spanish Republic|Second Republic]] there was a great political and social upheaval, marked by a sharp radicalization of the left and the right. The violent acts during this period included the burning of churches, the [[Sanjurjada|1932 failed coup d'état led by José Sanjurjo]], the [[Revolution of 1934]] and numerous attacks against rival political leaders. On the other hand, it is also during the Second Republic when important reforms to modernize the country were initiated: a democratic constitution, agrarian reform, restructuring of the army, political decentralization and [[Women's suffrage|women's right to vote]].

=== Civil War and Francoist dictatorship ===
{{Main|Spanish Civil War|Spanish Revolution of 1936|Francoist Spain}}

The Spanish Civil War broke out in 1936: on 17 and 18 July, part of the military [[Spanish coup of July 1936|carried out a coup d'état]] that triumphed in only part of the country. The situation led to a civil war, in which the territory was divided into two zones: one [[Republican faction (Spanish Civil War)|under the authority of the Republican government]], that counted on outside support from the [[Soviet Union]] and [[Mexico]] (and from [[Foreign involvement in the Spanish Civil War#International Brigades|International Brigades]]), and the other controlled by the putschists (the [[Nationalist faction (Spanish Civil War)|Nationalist or rebel faction]]), most critically supported by [[Nazi Germany]] and [[Fascist Italy (1922–1943)|Fascist Italy]]. The Republic was not supported by the Western powers due to the British-led policy of [[non-intervention]].  General [[Francisco Franco]] was sworn in as the supreme leader of the rebels on 1 October 1936. An uneasy relationship between the Republican government and the grassroots anarchists who had initiated a partial [[Spanish Revolution of 1936|Social revolution]] also ensued.

The civil war was viciously fought and there were [[Spanish Civil War#Atrocities|many atrocities committed by all sides]]. The [[Spanish Civil War|war]] claimed the lives of over 500,000 people and caused the flight of up to a half-million citizens from the country.<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/programmes/from_our_own_corrisedrespondent/2809025.stm Spanish Civil War fighters look back], BBC News, 23 February 2003</ref><ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/europe/spain/3998443/Relatives-of-Spaniards-who-fled-Franco-granted-citizenship.html |title=Relatives of Spaniards who fled Franco granted citizenship |work=The Daily Telegraph |date=28 December 2008 |access-date=18 January 2014 |location=London |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130723074619/http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/europe/spain/3998443/Relatives-of-Spaniards-who-fled-Franco-granted-citizenship.html |archive-date=23 July 2013 }}</ref> On 1 April 1939, five months before the beginning of [[World War II]], the rebel side led by Franco emerged victorious, imposing a dictatorship over the whole country.

[[File:Reemplazo republicano.jpg|thumb|Republican volunteers at [[Teruel]], 1936]]
The regime remained chiefly [[neutrality (international relations)|"neutral"]] from a nominal standpoint in the Second World War (it briefly switched its position to "non-belligerent"), although it was [[Spain in World War II|sympathetic]] to [[Axis Powers|the Axis]] and provided the Nazi [[Wehrmacht]] with [[Blue Division|Spanish volunteers in the Eastern Front]]. The only legal party under Franco's dictatorship was the [[Falange Española Tradicionalista y de las JONS]] (FET y de las JONS), formed in 1937 upon the merging of the Fascist [[Falange Española de las JONS]] and the Carlist traditionalists and to which the rest of right-wing groups supporting the rebels also added. The name of "[[Movimiento Nacional]]", sometimes understood as a wider structure than the FET y de las JONS proper, largely imposed over the later's name in official documents along the 1950s.

After World War II Spain was politically and economically isolated, and was kept out of the United Nations. This changed in 1955, during the [[Cold War]] period, when it became strategically important for the US to establish a military presence on the Iberian Peninsula as a counter to any possible move by the Soviet Union into the Mediterranean basin. In the 1960s, Spain registered an [[Spanish miracle|unprecedented rate of economic growth]] which was propelled by [[Spanish miracle#Industrialisation|industrialisation]], a [[Spanish miracle#Rural exodus|mass internal migration]] from rural areas to [[Madrid]], [[Barcelona]] and the [[Basque Country (autonomous community)|Basque Country]] and the creation of a [[Spanish miracle#Mass tourism|mass tourism industry]]. Franco's rule was also characterised by [[Francoist Spain#Authoritarianism|authoritarianism]], [[Francoist Spain#Spanish nationalism|promotion of a unitary national identity]], [[National Catholicism]], and [[Language policies of Francoist Spain|discriminatory language policies]].

On 17 January 1966, [[1966 Palomares B-52 crash|a fatal collision]] occurred between a B-52G and a KC-135 Stratotanker over [[Palomares, Almería|Palomares]].

=== Restoration of democracy ===
{{Main|Spanish transition to democracy|Spanish society after the democratic transition}}

With Franco's death in November 1975, [[Juan Carlos I of Spain|Juan Carlos]] succeeded to the position of [[King of Spain]] and [[head of state]] in accordance with the franquist law. With the approval of the new [[Spanish Constitution of 1978]] and the [[Spanish transition to democracy|restoration of democracy]], the State [[devolution|devolved]] much authority to the regions and created an internal organisation based on [[autonomous communities of Spain|autonomous communities]]. The [[Spanish 1977 Amnesty Law]] let people of Franco's regime continue inside institutions without consequences, even perpetrators of some crimes during transition to democracy like the [[Massacre of 3 March 1976 in Vitoria]] or [[1977 Massacre of Atocha]].<!-- The 'founding chairman' of the current leading political party in Spain, the [[People's Party (Spain)|People's Party]], was [[Manuel Fraga Iribarne|Manuel Fraga]] who had been a minister in Franco's government and yet continued with his political career until shortly before his death in 2012.-->

On 23 February 1981, rebel elements among the security forces seized the Cortes in an attempt to impose [[23-F|a military-backed government]]. King Juan Carlos took personal command of the military and successfully ordered the coup plotters, via national television, to surrender.<ref>{{cite news |title=King Orders army to crush coup |url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/1981/feb/23/spain.fromthearchive |access-date=19 March 2020 |work=The Guardian |date=23 February 1981}}</ref>

During the 1980s the democratic restoration made possible a growing open society. New cultural movements based on freedom appeared, like [[La Movida Madrileña]] and a culture of human rights arose with [[Gregorio Peces-Barba]]. On 30 May 1982 Spain joined [[NATO]], followed by [[1986 Spanish NATO membership referendum|a referendum]] after a strong social opposition. That year the [[Spanish Socialist Workers Party]] (PSOE) came to power, the first left-wing government in 43 years. In 1986 Spain joined the [[European Economic Community]], which later became the [[European Union]]. The PSOE was replaced in government by the [[People's Party (Spain)|Partido Popular]] (PP) in 1996 after scandals around participation of the government of [[Felipe González]] in the [[GAL (paramilitary group)|Dirty war against ETA]]; at that point the PSOE had served almost 14 consecutive years in office.

On 1 January 2002, Spain fully adopted the [[euro]], and Spain experienced strong economic growth, well above the EU average during the early 2000s.

In 2002 the [[Prestige oil spill]] occurred with big ecological consequences along Spain's Atlantic coastline. In 2003 [[José María Aznar]] supported US president [[George W.

[[File:Spain topo.jpg|thumb|Topographic map of Spain]]

At {{convert|505992|km2|sqmi|0|abbr=on}}, Spain is the world's [[List of countries and outlying territories by area|fifty-second largest country]] and [[Area and population of European countries|Europe's fourth largest country]]. It is some {{convert|47000|km2|sqmi|abbr=on}} smaller than France and {{convert|81000|km2|sqmi|abbr=on}} larger than the US state of California. Mount [[Teide]] ([[Tenerife]]) is the highest mountain peak in Spain and is the third largest volcano in the world from its base. Spain is a [[List of transcontinental countries|transcontinental country]], having territory in both [[Europe]] and [[Africa]].

Spain lies between latitudes [[27th parallel north|27°]] and [[44th parallel north|44° N]], and longitudes [[19th meridian west|19° W]] and [[5th meridian east|5° E]].

On the west, Spain is bordered by [[Portugal]]; on the south, it is bordered by [[Gibraltar]] (a [[British overseas territory]]) and [[Morocco]], through its [[exclave]]s in North Africa ([[Ceuta]] and [[Melilla]], and the peninsula of [[Peñón de Vélez de la Gomera|Vélez de la Gomera]]). On the northeast, along the [[Pyrenees]] mountain range, it is bordered by France and [[Andorra]]. Along the Pyrenees in [[province of Girona|Girona]], a small exclave town called [[Llívia]] is surrounded by France.

=== Islands ===
{{Main|List of islands of Spain}}

Spain also includes the [[Balearic Islands]] in the [[Mediterranean Sea]], the [[Canary Islands]] in the Atlantic Ocean and a number of uninhabited islands on the Mediterranean side of the [[Strait of Gibraltar]], known as {{lang|es|[[plazas de soberanía]]}} ("places of sovereignty", or territories under Spanish sovereignty), such as the [[Chafarinas Islands]] and [[Peñón de Alhucemas|Alhucemas]]. The peninsula of [[Peñón de Vélez de la Gomera|Vélez de la Gomera]] is also regarded as a ''plaza de soberanía''. The isle of [[Alboran Island|Alborán]], located in the Mediterranean between Spain and North Africa, is also administered by Spain, specifically by the municipality of [[Almería]], Andalusia. The little [[Pheasant Island]] in the River [[Bidasoa]] is a Spanish-French [[condominium (international law)|condominium]].

=== Mountains and rivers ===
[[File:Valley of Ordesa, Ordesa y Monte Perdido National Park, Spain.jpg|thumb|right|[[Ordesa y Monte Perdido National Park]] in the [[Pyrenees]], a [[World Heritage Site]]]]

Mainland Spain is a [[mountainous]] country, dominated by high [[plateau]]s and mountain chains. After the Pyrenees, the main mountain ranges are the [[Cantabrian Mountains|Cordillera Cantábrica]] (Cantabrian Range), [[Sistema Ibérico]] (Iberian System), [[Sistema Central]] (Central System), [[Montes de Toledo]], [[Sierra Morena]] and the [[Sistema Bético]] (Baetic System) whose highest peak, the {{convert|3478|m|ft|adj=mid|abbr=off|-high}} [[Mulhacén]], located in [[Sierra Nevada (Spain)|Sierra Nevada]], is the highest elevation in the Iberian Peninsula. The highest point in Spain is the [[Teide]], a {{convert|3718|m|ft|adj=on}} active [[volcano]] in the Canary Islands. The [[Meseta Central]] (often translated as "Inner Plateau") is a vast plateau in the heart of peninsular Spain.

There are several major [[rivers in Spain]] such as the [[Tagus]] (''Tajo''), [[Ebro]], [[Guadiana River|Guadiana]], [[Douro]] (''Duero''), [[Guadalquivir]], [[Júcar River|Júcar]], [[Segura]], [[Turia River|Turia]] and [[Minho River|Minho]] (''Miño''). [[Alluvial plain]]s are found along the coast, the largest of which is that of the Guadalquivir in [[Andalusia]].

<!--[[File:Official Köppen climate classification of Spain maded by AEMET.png|thumb|right|Official climatic map of the [[Iberian Peninsula]] maded by [[AEMET]]]]-->
Three main climatic zones can be separated, according to geographical situation and [[orography|orographic]] conditions:<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.schweizerbart.de/resources/downloads/paper_free/55034.pdf |title=World Map of the Köppen-Geiger climate classification updated – (see p.3) |access-date=30 April 2011}}</ref><ref>[http://www.city-data.com/forum/attachments/weather/56180d1263187925-ultimate-climate-poll-koppen-climate-classification-kottek_et_al_2006.gif World Map of Köppen-Geiger Climate Classification] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130723083834/http://www.city-data.com/forum/attachments/weather/56180d1263187925-ultimate-climate-poll-koppen-climate-classification-kottek_et_al_2006.gif |date=23 July 2013 }}, city-data.com, April 2006.</ref><ref>[//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/87/K%C3%B6ppen_World_Map_%28retouched_version%29.png Media:Koppen World Map.png]</ref>
* The [[Mediterranean climate]], characterised by warm/hot and dry summers, is dominant in the peninsula. It has two varieties: ''Csa'' and ''Csb'' according to the [[Köppen climate classification]].
** The ''Csa'' zone is associated to areas with hot summers. It is predominant in the Mediterranean and Southern Atlantic coast and inland throughout [[Andalusia]], Extremadura and much, if not most, of the centre of the country. The ''Csa'' zone covers climatic zones with both relatively warm and cold winters which are considered extremely different to each other at a local level, reason for which Köppen classification is often eschewed within Spain. Local climatic maps generally divide the Mediterranean zone (which covers most of the country) between warm-winter and cold-winter zones, rather than according to summer temperatures.
** The ''Csb'' zone has warm rather than hot summers, and extends to additional cool-winter areas not typically associated with a Mediterranean climate, such as much of central and northern-central of Spain (e.g. western [[Castile and León|Castile–León]], northeastern [[Castilla-La Mancha]] and northern [[Community of Madrid|Madrid]]) and into much rainier areas (notably [[Galicia (Spain)|Galicia]]). Note areas with relatively high rainfall such as Galicia are not considered Mediterranean under local classifications, but classed as oceanic.
* The [[semi-arid climate]] (''BSk'', ''BSh''), is predominant in the southeastern quarter of the country, but is also widespread in other areas of Spain. It covers most of the [[Region of Murcia]], southern [[Valencian Community|Valencia]] and eastern Andalusia, where true hot desert climates also exist. Further to the north, it is predominant in the upper and mid reaches of the [[Ebro]] valley, which crosses southern [[Navarre]], central Aragon and western Catalonia. It also is found in Madrid, Extremadura, Castilla-La Mancha, and some locations of western Andalusia. The dry season extends beyond the summer and average temperature depends on altitude and latitude.
* The [[oceanic climate]] (''Cfb''), located in the northern quarter of the country, especially in the Atlantic region ([[Basque Country (autonomous community)|Basque Country]], [[Cantabria]], [[Asturias]], and partly Galicia and Castile–León). Additionally it is also found in northern Navarre, in most highlands areas along the [[Sistema Ibérico|Iberian System]] and in the [[Pyrenees|Pyrenean]] valleys, where a humid subtropical variant (''Cfa'') also occurs. Winter and summer temperatures are influenced by the ocean, and have no seasonal drought.

Apart from these main types, other sub-types can be found, like the [[alpine climate]] in areas with very high altitude, the [[humid subtropical climate]] in areas of northeastern Spain and the [[continental climate]]s (''Dfc'', ''Dfb'' / ''Dsc'', ''Dsb'') in the [[Pyrenees]] as well as parts of the [[Cordillera Cantábrica|Cantabrian Range]], the [[Sistema Central|Central System]], [[Sierra Nevada (Spain)|Sierra Nevada]] and the [[Sistema Ibérico|Iberian System]], and a typical [[desert climate]] (''BWk'', ''BWh'') in the zone of Almería, Murcia and eastern [[Canary Islands]]. Low-lying areas of the Canary Islands average above {{convert|18.0|C|1}} during their coldest month, thus having a [[tropical climate]].

=== Fauna and flora ===

{{main|Wildlife of Spain}}

The [[fauna]] presents a wide diversity that is due in large part to the geographical position of the Iberian peninsula between the Atlantic and the Mediterranean and between Africa and [[Eurasia]], and the great diversity of habitats and [[biotopes]], the result of a considerable variety of climates and well differentiated regions.

The vegetation of Spain is varied due to several factors including the diversity of the terrain, the climate and [[latitude]]. Spain includes different [[phytogeographic]] regions, each with its own floral characteristics resulting largely from the interaction of climate, topography, soil type and fire, and [[Biotic component|biotic]] factors. The country had a 2019 [[Forest Landscape Integrity Index]] mean score of 4.23/10, ranking it 130th globally out of 172 countries.<ref name="FLII-Supplementary">{{cite journal|last1=Grantham|first1=H.

{{See also|Spanish Constitution of 1978}}

The constitutional history of Spain dates back to the constitution of 1812. In June 1976, Spain's new King [[Juan Carlos]] dismissed [[Carlos Arias Navarro]] and appointed the reformer [[Adolfo Suárez]] as Prime Minister.<ref name="From Dictatorship to Democracy">John Hooper, ''The New Spaniards'', 2001, ''From Dictatorship to Democracy''</ref><ref name="Spain's fast-living king turns 70">[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/7171971.stm Spain's fast-living king turns 70] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100106025042/http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/7171971.stm |date=6 January 2010 }} BBC News Friday, 4 January 2008 Extracted 18 June 2009</ref> The resulting [[1977 Spanish general election|general election in 1977]] convened the ''[[Constituent Cortes]]'' (the Spanish Parliament, in its capacity as a constitutional assembly) for the purpose of drafting and approving the constitution of 1978.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.senado.es/constitu_i/index.html |title=Spanish Constitution |publisher=Senado.es |access-date=1 November 2011 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111104013009/http://www.senado.es/constitu_i/index.html |archive-date=4 November 2011 }}</ref> After a national referendum on 6 December 1978, 88% of voters approved of the new constitution – a culmination of the [[Spanish transition to democracy]].

As a result, Spain is now composed of 17 [[autonomous communities of Spain|autonomous communities]] and two [[autonomous communities of Spain#Autonomous cities and "plazas de soberanía"|autonomous cities]] with varying degrees of autonomy thanks to its Constitution, which nevertheless explicitly states the indivisible unity of the Spanish nation. The constitution also specifies that Spain has no state religion and that all are free to practice and believe as they wish.

=== Government ===
[[File:Conmemoración del 40 Aniversario de la Constitución Española 05.jpg|thumb|The [[Congress of Deputies]]]]

Spain is a [[constitutional monarchy]], with a hereditary monarch and a [[bicameral parliament]], the ''[[Cortes Generales]]'' (General Courts).<ref name="Shelley2015">{{cite book|author=Fred M.

The [[legislative branch]] is made up of the [[Congress of Deputies]] (''Congreso de los Diputados''), a lower house with 350 members, elected by popular vote on block lists by proportional representation to serve four-year terms, and the [[Spanish Senate|Senate]] (''Senado''), an upper house with 259 seats of which 208 are directly elected by popular vote, using a [[limited voting]] method, and the other 51 appointed by the regional legislatures to also serve four-year terms.

The executive branch consists of a [[Council of Ministers of Spain|Council of Ministers]] presided over by the Prime Minister, who is [[Prime Minister of Spain#Royal Nomination, Congressional Confirmation|nominated as candidate]] by the [[Monarchy of Spain|monarch]] after holding consultations with representatives from the different parliamentary groups, voted in by the members of the lower house during an investiture session and then formally appointed by the monarch.

[[File:Palau Reial Pedralbes (Barcelona).JPG|thumb|[[Palau Reial de Pedralbes]] in Barcelona, headquarters of the [[Union for the Mediterranean]].]]
After the return of democracy following the death of [[Francisco Franco|Franco]] in 1975, Spain's [[foreign policy]] priorities were to break out of the diplomatic isolation of the [[Spain under Franco|Franco years]] and expand [[diplomatic relations]], enter the [[European Union|European Community]], and define security relations with the West.

As a member of [[NATO]] since 1982, Spain has established itself as a participant in multilateral international security activities. Spain's EU membership represents an important part of its foreign policy. Even on many international issues beyond western Europe, Spain prefers to coordinate its efforts with its EU partners through the European political co-operation mechanisms.{{vague|date=March 2015}}

Spain has maintained its special relations with [[Hispanic America]] and the [[Philippines]]. Its policy emphasises the concept of an [[Ibero-America]]n community, essentially the renewal of the concept of ''"[[Hispanidad]]"'' or ''"[[Hispanism]]o"'', as it is often referred to in English, which has sought to link the Iberian Peninsula with Hispanic America through language, commerce, history and culture. It is fundamentally "based on shared values and the recovery of democracy."<ref>Garcia Cantalapiedra, David, and Ramon Pacheco Pardo, ''Contemporary Spanish Foreign Policy'' (Routledge, 2014).

[[File:Gibraltar 10000m.jpg|thumb|right|Aerial view showing the [[Rock of Gibraltar]], the [[isthmus of Gibraltar]] and the [[Bay of Gibraltar]].]]
The Spanish claim makes a distinction between the [[Disputed status of the isthmus between Gibraltar and Spain|isthmus]] that connects the Rock to the Spanish mainland on the one hand, and the Rock and city of Gibraltar on the other. While the Rock and city were ceded by the Treaty of Utrecht, Spain asserts that the "occupation of the isthmus is illegal and against the principles of [[International Law]]".<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.maec.es/subwebs/Embajadas/Londres/es/MenuPpal/Gibraltar/Documents/000.001.002.003%20Título.%20Prefacio.Índice.%20Informe%20(27.02.08).doc |title=La cuestión de Gibraltar |publisher=Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Cooperation of Spain |date=January 2008 |access-date=3 January 2010 |language=es |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090529192351/http://www.maec.es/subwebs/Embajadas/Londres/es/MenuPpal/Gibraltar/Documents/000.001.002.003%20T%C3%ADtulo.%20Prefacio.%C3%8Dndice.%20Informe%20%2827.02.08%29.doc |archive-date=29 May 2009 }}</ref> The United Kingdom relies on ''de facto'' arguments of possession by [[prescription (sovereignty transfer)|prescription]] in relation to the isthmus,<ref>{{cite book |title=Gibraltar: British or Spanish? |author=Peter Gold |publisher=Routledge |year=2005 |isbn=978-0-415-34795-2 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=u9YH_fLPu1MC |page=4}}</ref> as there has been "continuous possession [of the isthmus] over a long period".<ref>{{cite web|author=UK Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs |year=1999 |url=http://www.fco.gov.uk/Files/kfile/OT13.pdf |title=Partnership for Progress and Prosperity: Britain and the Overseas Territories.

Another claim by Spain is about the [[Savage Islands]], part of [[Portugal]]. In clash with the Portuguese position, Spain claims that they are rocks rather than islands, and therefore Spain does not accept any extension of the Portuguese [[Exclusive Economic Zone]] (200 nautical miles) generated by the islands, while acknowledging the ''Selvagens'' having [[territorial waters]] (12 nautical miles). On 5 July 2013, Spain sent a letter to the UN expressing these views.<ref>{{citation|url=https://www.un.org/Depts/los/clcs_new/submissions_files/prt44_09/esp_re_prt2013.pdf|title=Spain's letter to the UN|publisher=UN|date=September 2013|language=es|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170525185334/http://www.un.org/Depts/los/clcs_new/submissions_files/prt44_09/esp_re_prt2013.pdf|archive-date=25 May 2017}}</ref><ref>[http://www.theportugalnews.com/news/spain-disputes-portugal-islands/29269 "Spain disputes Portugal islands"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130908225016/http://www.theportugalnews.com/news/spain-disputes-portugal-islands/29269 |date=8 September 2013 }} ''[[The Portugal News]]''.

Spain claims the sovereignty over the [[Perejil Island]], a small, uninhabited rocky [[islet]] located in the South shore of the [[Strait of Gibraltar]]. The island lies {{convert|250|m|ft}} just off the coast of Morocco, {{convert|8|km|mi}} from [[Ceuta]] and {{convert|13.5|km|mi}} from mainland Spain. Its sovereignty is disputed between Spain and Morocco. It was the subject of an armed incident between the two countries in 2002. The incident ended when both countries agreed to return to the status quo ante which existed prior to the Moroccan occupation of the island. The islet is now deserted and without any sign of sovereignty.

Besides the Perejil Island, the Spanish-held territories claimed by other countries are two: Morocco claims the Spanish cities of Ceuta and [[Melilla]] and the ''[[plazas de soberanía]]'' islets off the northern coast of Africa. Portugal does not recognise Spain's sovereignty over the territory of [[Olivenza]] which was annexed by Spain in 1801 after the [[War of the Oranges]]. Portugal stance has been the territory being ''de iure'' Portuguese territory and ''de facto'' Spanish.<ref>{{Cite journal|title=La cuestión de Olivenza, a la luz del Derecho internacional público|last=Fernández Liesa|first=Carlos R.|publisher=Ayuntamiento de Olivenza|year=2004|pages=234–235|journal=Encuentros: Revista luso-española de investigadores en Ciencias humanas y sociales.

=== Administrative divisions ===
{{Main|Political divisions of Spain}}

The Spanish State is divided into 17 autonomous communities and 2 autonomous cities, both groups being the highest or first-order administrative division in the country. Autonomous communities are divided into provinces, of which there are 50 in total, and in turn, provinces are divided into municipalities. In Catalonia, two additional divisions exist, the ''comarques'' (sing. ''comarca'') and the ''vegueries'' (sing. ''vegueria'') both of which have administrative powers; ''comarques'' being aggregations of municipalities, and the ''vegueries'' being aggregations of ''comarques''. The concept of a ''comarca'' exists in all autonomous communities, however, unlike Catalonia, these are merely historical or geographical subdivisions.

==== Autonomous communities ====
{{Main|Autonomous communities of Spain}}
{{See also|Nationalities and regions of Spain}}
{{Autonomous regions of Spain|float=right}}

Spain's autonomous communities are the first level administrative divisions of the country. They were created after the current constitution came into effect (in 1978) in recognition of the right to self-government of the "[[nationalities and regions of Spain|''nationalities'' and regions of Spain]]".<ref>Article 143 of the 1978 Spanish Constitution in reference to Article 2</ref> The autonomous communities were to comprise adjacent provinces with common historical, cultural, and economic traits. This territorial organisation, based on [[devolution]], is known in Spain as the "State of Autonomies".

The basic institutional law of each autonomous community is the [[Statute of Autonomy]]. The Statutes of Autonomy establish the name of the community according to its historical and contemporary identity, the limits of its territories, the name and organisation of the institutions of government and the rights they enjoy according to the constitution.<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20071026020151/http://www.constitucion.es/constitucion/lenguas/ingles.html#8 Chapter 3. Autonomous Communities. 147th Article]. ''Spanish Constitution of 1978''. Retrieved 10 December 2007</ref>

The governments of all autonomous communities must be based on a division of powers and comprise
* a legislative assembly whose members must be elected by [[universal suffrage]] according to the system of [[proportional representation]] and in which all areas that integrate the territory are fairly represented;
* a government council, with executive and administrative functions headed by a president, elected by the Legislative Assembly and nominated by the [[King of Spain]];
* a supreme court, under the supreme court of Spain, which heads the judiciary in the autonomous community.

Catalonia, Galicia and the Basque Country, which identified themselves as ''nationalities'', were granted self-government through a rapid process. Andalusia also took that denomination in its first Statute of Autonomy, even though it followed the longer process stipulated in the constitution for the rest of the country.

The autonomous communities have wide legislative and executive autonomy, with their own parliaments and regional governments. The distribution of powers may be different for every community, as laid out in their Statutes of Autonomy, since devolution was intended to be asymmetrical. Only two communities—the Basque Country and Navarre—have full fiscal autonomy. Beyond fiscal autonomy, the ''nationalities''—Andalusia, the Basque Country, Catalonia, and Galicia—were devolved more powers than the rest of the communities, among them the ability of the regional president to dissolve the parliament and call for elections at any time. In addition, the Basque Country, Catalonia and Navarre have police corps of their own: [[Ertzaintza]], [[Mossos d'Esquadra]] and the [[Policía Foral]] respectively. Other communities have more limited forces or none at all, like the ''Policía Autónoma Andaluza''<ref name="cartujo">{{cite web|url=http://www.cartujo.org/pag(a9).htm|title=Unidad de Policía de la Comunidad Autónoma de Andalucía|publisher=Cartujo.org|access-date=23 October 2007|language=es|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071107145807/http://www.cartujo.org/pag(a9).htm|archive-date=7 November 2007}}</ref> in [[Andalusia]] or the [[BESCAM]] in Madrid.

Nonetheless, recent amendments to existing Statutes of Autonomy or the promulgation of new Statutes altogether, have reduced the asymmetry between the powers originally granted to the ''nationalities'' and the rest of the regions.

Finally, along with the 17 autonomous communities, two autonomous cities are also part of the State of Autonomies and are first-order territorial divisions: [[Ceuta]] and [[Melilla]]. These are two exclaves located in the northern African coast.

==== Provinces and municipalities ====
{{Main|Provinces of Spain|Municipalities of Spain}}

Autonomous communities are divided into [[Provinces of Spain|provinces]], which served as their territorial building blocks. In turn, provinces are divided into [[municipalities of Spain|municipalities]]. The existence of both the provinces and the municipalities is guaranteed and protected by the constitution, not necessarily by the Statutes of Autonomy themselves. Municipalities are granted autonomy to manage their internal affairs, and provinces are the territorial divisions designed to carry out the activities of the State.<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20071026020151/http://www.constitucion.es/constitucion/lenguas/ingles.html#8 Articles 140 and 141]. Spanish Constitution of 1978</ref>

The current provincial division structure is based—with minor changes—on the [[1833 territorial division of Spain|1833 territorial division]] by [[Javier de Burgos]], and in all, the Spanish territory is divided into 50 provinces. The communities of Asturias, Cantabria, La Rioja, the Balearic Islands, Madrid, Murcia and Navarre are the only communities that comprise a single province, which is coextensive with the community itself. In these cases, the administrative institutions of the province are replaced by the governmental institutions of the community.

By the mid-1990s the economy had commenced the growth that had been disrupted by the global recession of the early 1990s. The strong economic growth helped the government to reduce the government debt as a percentage of GDP and Spain's high unemployment rate began to steadily decline. With the government budget in balance and inflation under control Spain was admitted into the Eurozone in 1999.

Since the 1990s some Spanish companies have gained multinational status, often expanding their activities in culturally close Latin America. Spain is the second biggest foreign investor there, after the United States. Spanish companies have also expanded into Asia, especially China and India.<ref name=Economist2009bet>{{cite news |date = 30 April 2009 |access-date = 14 May 2009 |title = A good bet? |periodical = The Economist |series = Business |place = Madrid |url = http://www.economist.com/business/displaystory.cfm?story_id=13579705 |url-status=live |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20090504012604/http://www.economist.com/business/displaystory.cfm?story_id=13579705 |archive-date = 4 May 2009 }}</ref> This early global expansion is a competitive advantage over its competitors and European neighbours. The reason for this early expansion is the booming interest towards Spanish language and culture in Asia and Africa and a corporate culture that learned to take risks in unstable markets.

By 2016, the automotive industry was generating 8.7 percent of Spain's [[gross domestic product]], employing about nine percent of the manufacturing industry.<ref name=WSJ/> By 2008 the automobile industry was the 2nd most exported industry<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.investinspain.org/icex/cda/controller/interes/0,5464,5322992_6261564_6278959_0,00.html |title=>> Spain in numbers |publisher=Invest in Spain |access-date=13 March 2013 |archive-date=26 March 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130326095116/http://www.investinspain.org/icex/cda/controller/interes/0,5464,5322992_6261564_6278959_0,00.html |url-status=dead }}</ref> while in 2015 about 80% of the total production was for export.<ref name=WSJ/>

German companies poured €4.8 billion into Spain in 2015, making the country the second-largest destination for German [[foreign direct investment]] behind only the U.S. The lion's share of that investment—€4 billion—went to the country's auto industry.<ref name=WSJ/>

=== Agriculture ===
{{Main|Agriculture in Spain}}

Crop areas were farmed in two highly diverse manners. Areas relying on non-irrigated cultivation (''secano''), which made up 85% of the entire crop area, depended solely on rainfall as a source of water. They included the humid regions of the north and the northwest, as well as vast arid zones that had not been irrigated. The much more productive regions devoted to irrigated cultivation (''regadío'') accounted for 3 million hectares in 1986, and the government hoped that this area would eventually double, as it already had doubled since 1950. Particularly noteworthy was the development in [[Province of Almería|Almería]]—one of the most arid and desolate provinces of Spain—of winter crops of various fruits and vegetables for export to Europe.

[[File:Viñedos en Briñas.jpg|thumb|A [[vineyard]] in [[Rioja (wine)|Rioja]]]]

Though only about 17% of Spain's cultivated land was irrigated, it was estimated to be the source of between 40 and 45% of the gross value of crop production and of 50% of the value of agricultural exports. More than half of the irrigated area was planted in [[maize|corn]], [[fruit tree]]s, and vegetables. Other agricultural products that benefited from irrigation included grapes, cotton, [[sugar beet]]s, potatoes, [[legume]]s, [[olive tree]]s, mangos, [[strawberries]], tomatoes, and [[fodder]] grasses. Depending on the nature of the crop, it was possible to harvest two successive crops in the same year on about 10% of the country's irrigated land.

[[Citrus fruit]]s, vegetables, [[cereal grain]]s, [[olive oil]], and wine—Spain's traditional agricultural products—continued to be important in the 1980s. In 1983 they represented 12%, 12%, 8%, 6%, and 4%, respectively, of the country's agricultural production. Because of the changed diet of an increasingly affluent population, there was a notable increase in the consumption of livestock, poultry, and [[dairy product]]s. Meat production for domestic consumption became the single most important agricultural activity, accounting for 30% of all farm-related production in 1983. Increased attention to livestock was the reason that Spain became a net importer of grains. Ideal growing conditions, combined with proximity to important north European markets, made citrus fruits Spain's leading export. Fresh vegetables and fruits produced through intensive irrigation farming also became important export commodities, as did [[sunflower seed oil]] that was produced to compete with the more expensive olive oils in oversupply throughout the Mediterranean countries of the [[European Economic Community|European Community]].

The Spanish road system is mainly centralised, with six highways connecting [[Madrid]] to the [[Basque Country (autonomous community)|Basque Country]], [[Catalonia]], [[Valencian Community|Valencia]], West [[Andalusia]], Extremadura and [[Galicia (Spain)|Galicia]]. Additionally, there are highways along the Atlantic ([[Ferrol, Spain|Ferrol]] to [[Vigo]]), Cantabrian ([[Oviedo]] to [[San Sebastián]]) and [[Mediterranean Sea|Mediterranean]] ([[Girona]] to [[Cádiz]]) coasts. Spain aims to put one&nbsp;million [[electric car]]s on the road by 2014 as part of the government's plan to save energy and boost [[Efficient energy use|energy efficiency]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.triplepundit.com/2008/07/algae-based-biofuels-in-plain-english-why-it-matters-how-it-works/ |title=Algae Based Biofuels in Plain English: Why it Matters, How it Works.

In the 19th and 20th centuries, science in Spain was held back by severe political instability and consequent economic underdevelopment. Despite the conditions, some important scientists and engineers emerged. The most notable were [[Miguel Servet]], [[Santiago Ramón y Cajal]], [[Narcís Monturiol]], [[Celedonio Calatayud]], [[Juan de la Cierva]], [[Leonardo Torres y Quevedo]], [[Margarita Salas]] and [[Severo Ochoa]].

The [[Consejo Superior de Investigaciones Científicas]] (CSIC) is the leading public agency dedicated to scientific research in the country. It ranked as the 5th top governmental scientific institution worldwide (and 32nd overall) in the 2018 SCImago Institutions Rankings.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.scimagoir.com/rankings.php?sector=all|title=Scimago Institution Rankings|access-date=5 January 2018}}</ref>

With the exception of the region surrounding the capital, [[Madrid]], the most populated areas lie around the coast. The population of Spain has risen 2 1/2 times since 1900, when it stood at 18.6&nbsp;million, principally due to the spectacular demographic boom in the 1960s and early 1970s.<ref>Joseph Harrison, David Corkill (2004).

Native [[Spaniards]] make up 88% of the total population of Spain. After the [[List of countries and territories by fertility rate|birth rate]] plunged in the 1980s and Spain's population growth rate dropped, the population again trended upward initially upon the return of many Spaniards who had emigrated to other European countries during the 1970s, and more recently, fuelled by large numbers of immigrants who make up 12% of the population. The immigrants originate mainly in Latin America (39%), North Africa (16%), Eastern Europe (15%), and [[Sub-Saharan Africa]] (4%).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ine.es/inebase/cgi/axi?AXIS_PATH=/inebase/temas/t20/e245/p04/a2005/l0/&FILE_AXIS=00000010.px&CGI_DEFAULT=/inebase/temas/cgi.opt&COMANDO=SELECCION&CGI_URL=/inebase/cgi/ |publisher=Instituto Nacional de Estadística |title=Población extranjera por sexo, país de nacionalidad y edad |access-date=13 August 2008 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080325043135/http://www.ine.es/inebase/cgi/axi?AXIS_PATH=%2Finebase%2Ftemas%2Ft20%2Fe245%2Fp04%2Fa2005%2Fl0%2F&FILE_AXIS=00000010.px&CGI_DEFAULT=%2Finebase%2Ftemas%2Fcgi.opt&COMANDO=SELECCION&CGI_URL=%2Finebase%2Fcgi%2F |archive-date=25 March 2008 |url-status=dead }}</ref> In 2005, Spain instituted a three-month amnesty programme through which certain hitherto undocumented aliens were granted legal residency.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://politica.elpais.com/politica/2012/06/09/actualidad/1339259231_174858.html|title=700.000 inmigrantes en la mayor regularización en España|work=EL PAÍS|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180523100256/https://elpais.com/diario/2005/05/08/portada/1115503207_850215.html|archive-date=23 May 2018|date=8 May 2005}}</ref>

Substantial populations descended from Spanish colonists and immigrants exist in other parts of the world, most notably in Latin America. Beginning in the late 15th century, large numbers of Iberian colonists settled in what became Latin America and at present most [[white Latin American]]s (who make up about one-third of Latin America's population) are of Spanish or Portuguese origin.

{{Main|Spanish people|National and regional identity in Spain}}

The [[Spanish Constitution of 1978]], in its second article, recognises several contemporary [[polity|entities]]—''[[nationalities and regions of Spain|nationalities]]''—{{efn|name=Nationalities|The term "nationality" was chosen carefully in order to avoid the more politically charged term "nation", however in recent years it has been proposed to use this term in the Constitution and officially recognise Spain as a plurinational state ("nation of nations").}} and regions, within the context of the Spanish nation.

Spain has been described as a ''de facto'' [[plurinationalism|plurinational state]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://cadmus.eui.eu/handle/1814/10056|title=Rival nationalisms in a plurinational state: Spain, Catalonia and the Basque Country|publisher=Oxford University Press|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170525185738/http://cadmus.eui.eu/handle/1814/10056|archive-date=25 May 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://dialnet.unirioja.es/descarga/articulo/555054.pdf|title=España, una nación de naciones|publisher=University of Navarre|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170525185727/https://dialnet.unirioja.es/descarga/articulo/555054.pdf|archive-date=25 May 2017}}</ref> The identity of Spain rather accrues of an overlap of different territorial and ethnolinguistic identities than of a sole Spanish identity. In some cases some of the territorial identities may conflict with the dominant Spanish culture. Distinct traditional identities within Spain include the [[Basque people|Basques]], [[Catalan people|Catalans]], [[Galician people|Galicians]], [[Andalusians]] and [[Valencian people|Valencians]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://elpais.com/diario/1996/08/24/opinion/840837607_850215.html|title=Nacionalidades históricas|access-date=9 May 2016|work=El País|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160428110601/http://elpais.com/diario/1996/08/24/opinion/840837607_850215.html|archive-date=28 April 2016}}</ref> although to some extent all of the 17 autonomous communities may claim a distinct local identity.

It is this last feature of "shared identity" between the more local level or autonomous community and the Spanish level which makes the identity question in Spain complex and far from univocal.

Spain has a number of descendants of populations from former colonies, especially Latin America and North Africa. Smaller numbers of immigrants from several [[Sub-Saharan]] countries have recently been settling in Spain.

The Spanish constitution enshrines [[secularism]] in governance, as well as freedom of religion or belief for all, saying that no religion should have a "state character," while allowing for the state to "cooperate" with religious groups.

There have been four Spanish Popes. [[Pope Damasus I|Damasus I]], [[Pope Calixtus III|Calixtus III]], [[Pope Alexander VI|Alexander VI]] and [[Antipope Benedict XIII|Benedict XIII]]. Spanish mysticism provided an important intellectual resource against Protestantism with [[Carmelites]] like [[Teresa of Ávila]], a [[Counter-Reformation|reformist]] nun and [[John of the Cross]], a priest, taking the lead in their reform movement. Later, they became [[Doctors of the Church]]. The [[Society of Jesus]] was co-founded by [[Ignatius of Loyola]], whose [[Spiritual Exercises]] and movement led to the establishment of hundreds of colleges and universities in the world, including 28 in the United States alone. The Society's co-founder, [[Francis Xavier]], was a missionary who reached India and later Japan. In the 1960s, Jesuits [[Pedro Arrupe]] and [[Ignacio Ellacuría]] supported the movement of [[Liberation Theology]].{{citation needed|date=October 2020}}

A study made by the [[Union of Islamic Communities of Spain]] demonstrated that there were more than 2,100,000 inhabitants of Muslim background living in Spain {{As of|2019|lc=y}}, accounting for 4–5% of the total population of Spain. The vast majority was composed of immigrants and descendants originating from the [[Maghreb]] (especially [[Morocco]]) and other African countries. More than 879,000 (42%) of them had Spanish nationality.<ref>{{cite journal|title=Los musulmanes en España superan por primera vez los 2 millones de personas|journal=El Heraldo|year=2020|url=https://www.heraldo.es/noticias/nacional/2020/02/18/musulmanes-espana-superan-primera-vez-2-millones-personas-1359544.html|date= September 2020}}</ref>

The recent waves of immigration have also led to an increasing number of [[Hindus]], [[Buddhists]], [[Sikhs]] and [[Muslims]].
After the Reconquista in 1492, Muslims did not live in Spain for centuries. Late 19th-century colonial expansion in northwestern Africa gave a number of residents in [[Spanish Morocco]] and [[Western Sahara]] full citizenship. Their ranks have since been bolstered by recent immigration, especially from Morocco and Algeria.{{citation needed|date=October 2020}}

[[Judaism]] was practically non-existent in Spain from the 1492 expulsion until the 19th century, when Jews were again permitted to enter the country. Currently there are around 62,000 Jews in Spain, or 0.14% of the total population. Most are arrivals in the past century, while some are descendants of earlier Spanish Jews. Approximately 80,000 [[Jew]]s are thought to have lived in Spain prior to its expulsion.<ref>{{cite book|title=The Spanish Inquisition: A Historical Revision|url=https://archive.org/details/spanishinquisiti00henr|url-access=registration|year=1999|publisher=Yale University Press|author-link=Henry Kamen|last=Kamen|first=Henry|pages=[https://archive.org/details/spanishinquisiti00henr/page/29 29]–31}}</ref> However the Jewish Encyclopedia states the number over 800,000 to be too large and 235,000 as too small: 165,000 is given as expelled as possibly too small in favour of 200,000, and the numbers of converts after the 1391 pogroms as less. Other sources suggest 200,000 converts mostly after the pogroms of 1391 and upwards of 100,000 expelled. Descendants of these Sephardic Jews expelled in 1492 are given Spanish nationality if they request it.<ref>{{cite news |last=Sanz |first=Juan Carlos |title=Spain at last welcomes back the Sephardim |url=https://elpais.com/elpais/2016/01/22/inenglish/1453467510_159674.html |date=22 January 2016 |access-date=26 May 2018 |location=Tel Aviv |newspaper=[[El País]]}}</ref>

[[File:Prendimiento - Perdon.jpg|thumb|Procession with statue of the Blessed Virgin Mary of the Love of Saint Ferdinand (''Maria santísima del amor de San Fernando''), [[Malaga]].]]
Spain is a [[Western world|Western country]]. Almost every aspect of Spanish life is permeated by its Roman heritage, making Spain one of the major [[Romance-speaking Europe|Latin countries]] of Europe. Spanish culture is marked by strong historic ties to Catholicism, which played a pivotal role in the country's formation and subsequent identity. Spanish art, architecture, cuisine, and music have been shaped by successive waves of foreign invaders, as well as by the country's Mediterranean climate and geography. The centuries-long colonial era globalised Spanish language and culture, with Spain also absorbing the cultural and commercial products of its diverse empire.

=== World Heritage Sites ===

Spain has 47 [[World Heritage Site]]s. These include the landscape of [[Monte Perdido]] in the [[Pyrenees]], which is shared with France, the Prehistoric Rock Art Sites of the [[Côa Valley]] and [[Siega Verde]], which is shared with Portugal, the [[Heritage of Mercury.

[[File:Bronze statues of Don Quixote and Sancho Panza.jpg|thumb|Bronze statues of Don Quixote and Sancho Panza, at the Plaza de España in Madrid|alt=]]
The earliest recorded examples of vernacular Romance-based literature date from the same time and location, the rich mix of Muslim, Jewish, and Christian cultures in Muslim Spain, in which Maimonides, Averroes, and others worked, the [[kharja]]s (''jarchas'')

During the [[Reconquista]], the epic poem ''[[Cantar de Mio Cid]]'' was written about a real man—his battles, conquests, and daily life. The Valencian chivalric romance ''[[Tirant lo Blanch]]'' written in [[Valencian language|Valencian]] is also remarkable.

Other major plays from the medieval times were ''[[Mester de Juglaría]]'', ''[[Mester de Clerecía]]'', ''[[Coplas por la muerte de su padre]]'' or ''[[The Book of Good Love|El Libro de buen amor]]'' (The Book of Good Love).

During the [[Renaissance]] the major plays are ''[[La Celestina]]'' and ''[[El Lazarillo de Tormes]]'', while many religious literature was created with poets as [[Luis de León]], [[San Juan de la Cruz]], [[Santa Teresa de Jesús]], etc.

The [[Baroque]] is the most important period for Spanish culture. We are in the times of the [[Spanish Empire]]. The famous ''[[Don Quixote|Don Quijote de La Mancha]]'' by [[Miguel de Cervantes]] was written in this time. Other writers from the period are: [[Francisco de Quevedo]], [[Lope de Vega]], [[Pedro Calderón de la Barca|Calderón de la Barca]] or [[Tirso de Molina]].

During the [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] we find names such as [[Leandro Fernández de Moratín]], [[Benito Jerónimo Feijóo]], [[Gaspar Melchor de Jovellanos]] or [[Leandro Fernández de Moratín]].

During the [[Romanticism|Romantic period]], [[José Zorrilla]] created one of the most emblematic figures in European literature in ''[[Don Juan Tenorio]]''. Other writers from this period are [[Gustavo Adolfo Bécquer]], [[José de Espronceda]], [[Rosalía de Castro]] or [[Mariano José de Larra]].
[[File:Emilia Pardo Bazan (1896).jpg|thumb|120px|[[Emilia Pardo Bazán]]|alt=]]
[[File:Miguel Delibes (década de 1960) - 4.tif|thumb|upright=0.7|left|[[Miguel Delibes]] describes the situation of rural Spain after the [[Rural flight]] in the 1950s.]]
Artists such as [[Benito Pérez Galdós]], [[Emilia Pardo Bazán]], [[Leopoldo Alas]] (Clarín), [[Concepción Arenal]], [[Vicente Blasco Ibáñez]] and [[Menéndez Pelayo]] created [[Realism (arts)|Realist]] artworks. Realism offered depictions of contemporary life and society 'as they were'. In the spirit of general "Realism", Realist authors opted for depictions of everyday and banal activities and experiences, instead of romanticised or stylised presentations.

The group that has become known as the [[Generation of 1898]] was marked by the destruction of Spain's fleet in Cuba by US gunboats in 1898, which provoked a cultural crisis in Spain. The "Disaster" of 1898 led established writers to seek practical political, economic, and social solutions in essays grouped under the literary heading of ''Regeneracionismo''. For a group of younger writers, among them [[Miguel de Unamuno]], [[Pío Baroja]], and [[José Martínez Ruiz]] (Azorín), the Disaster and its cultural repercussions inspired a deeper, more radical literary shift that affected both form and content. These writers, along with [[Ramón del Valle-Inclán]], [[Antonio Machado]], [[Ramiro de Maeztu]], and Ángel Ganivet, came to be known as the Generation of '98.

The Generation of 1914 or ''Novecentismo''. The next supposed "generation" of Spanish writers following those of '98 already calls into question the value of such terminology. By the year 1914—the year of the outbreak of the First World War and of the publication of the first major work of the generation's leading voice, [[José Ortega y Gasset]]—a number of slightly younger writers had established their own place within the Spanish cultural field.

[[File:Rodoreda.jpg|thumb|120px|[[Mercè Rodoreda]]|alt=]]
Leading voices include the poet [[Juan Ramón Jiménez]], the academics and essayists [[Ramón Menéndez Pidal]], [[Gregorio Marañón]], [[Manuel Azaña]], [[Maria Zambrano]], [[Eugeni d'Ors]], [[Clara Campoamor]] and Ortega y Gasset, and the novelists Gabriel Miró, [[Ramón Pérez de Ayala]], and [[Ramón Gómez de la Serna]]. While still driven by the national and existential questions that obsessed the writers of '98, they approached these topics with a greater sense of distance and objectivity. [[Salvador de Madariaga]], another prominent intellectual and writer, was one of the founders of the [[College of Europe]] and the composer of the constitutive manifest of the [[Liberal International]].

The Generation of 1927, where poets Pedro Salinas, [[Jorge Guillén]], [[Federico García Lorca]], [[Vicente Aleixandre]], [[Dámaso Alonso]]. All were scholars of their national literary heritage, again evidence of the impact of the calls of ''regeneracionistas'' and the Generation of 1898 for Spanish intelligence to turn at least partially inwards.
[[File:JoseOrtegayGasset.jpg|thumb|120px|[[José Ortega y Gasset]]]]
Spain's two most preeminent writers in the second half of the 20th century were the [[Nobel Prize in Literature]] laureate [[Camilo José Cela]] and [[Miguel Delibes]] from [[Generation of '36]]. Spain is one of the countries with the most laureates of the [[Nobel Prize in Literature]], and including Latin American Nobel laureates, Spanish language literature ranks among the highest in numbers of laureates. The Spanish writers are: [[José Echegaray]], [[Jacinto Benavente]], [[Juan Ramón Jiménez]], [[Vicente Aleixandre]] and [[Camilo José Cela]]. The Portuguese writer [[José Saramago]], also awarded with the prize, lived for many years in Spain and spoke both Portuguese and Spanish. Saramago was also well known by his [[Iberism|Iberist]] ideas.

The [[Generation of '50]] are also known as the children of the civil war. [[Rosa Chacel]], [[Gloria Fuertes]], [[Jaime Gil de Biedma]], [[Juan Goytisolo]], [[Carmen Martín Gaite]], [[Ana María Matute]], [[Juan Marsé]], [[Blas de Otero]], [[Gabriel Celaya]], [[Antonio Gamoneda]], [[Rafael Sánchez Ferlosio]] or [[Ignacio Aldecoa]].

[[Premio Planeta de Novela]] and [[Miguel de Cervantes Prize]] are the two main awards nowadays in Spanish literature.

=== Philosophy ===

[[Seneca the Elder|Seneca]] was a philosopher residing in Spain during the time of the [[Roman Empire]].
During the period of Muslim rule in [[Al-Andalus]], Muslim, Jewish and Christian philosophies flourished, including the works of such philosophers such as [[Ibn Arabi]], [[Averroes]] and [[Maimonides]].<ref>{{Cite web|date=2011-04-17|title=Averroes and Maimonides: Master Minds of 12th Century Medieval Thought|url=https://simerg.com/literary-readings/averroes-and-maimonides-masterminds-of-12th-century-medieval-thought/|access-date=2021-01-26|website=Simerg – Insights from Around the World|language=en}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|title=Andalusia {{!}} History of Philosophy without any gaps|url=https://historyofphilosophy.net/islamic-world/andalusia|access-date=2021-01-26|website=historyofphilosophy.net}}</ref>

In the Middle Ages [[Ramon Llull]] flourished in Spain.

Humanist [[Luis Vives]] worked in Spain during the [[Renaissance]], as did [[Francisco de Vitoria]] (creator of the [[School of Salamanca]] and scholar on [[international law]]) and [[Bartolomé de las Casas]].{{citation needed|date=October 2020}}

The [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] in Spain arrived later and was less strong than in other European countries, but during the [[XIX century]] liberal ideas arrived in Spanish society. At the end of the century, socialist and libertarian ideas also flourished, with thinkers such as [[Francisco Pi y Margall]], [[Ricardo Mella]] and [[Francisco Ferrer Guardia]].{{citation needed|date=October 2020}}

In the first half of the 20th century among the most prominent philosophers were [[Maria Zambrano]] and [[José Ortega y Gasset]].{{citation needed|date=October 2020}}

Contemporary philosophers include [[Fernando Savater]] and [[Adela Cortina]], creator of the term ''[[aporophobia]]''.{{citation needed|date=October 2020}}

=== Art ===

Artists from Spain have been highly influential in the development of various European and [[Hispanic America|American]] [[art movement|artistic movements]]. Due to historical, geographical and generational diversity, Spanish art has known a great number of influences. The Mediterranean heritage with Greco-Roman and some Moorish and influences in Spain, especially in [[Andalusia]], is still evident today. European influences include Italy, Germany and France, especially during the [[Renaissance]], [[Baroque|Spanish Baroque]] and [[Neoclassicism|Neoclassical]] periods. There are many other autochthonous styles such as the [[Pre-Romanesque art and architecture]], [[Herrerian]] architecture or the [[Isabelline Gothic]].{{citation needed|date=October 2020}}

During the [[Golden Age]] painters working in Spain included [[El Greco]], [[José de Ribera]], [[Bartolomé Esteban Murillo]] and [[Francisco Zurbarán]]. Also in the Baroque period, [[Diego Velázquez]] created some of the most famous Spanish portraits, such as ''[[Las Meninas]]'' and ''[[Las Hilanderas (Velázquez)|Las Hilanderas]]''.<ref>{{Cite web|last=Anirudh|title=10 Most Famous Paintings by Diego Velazquez {{!}} Learnodo Newtonic|url=https://learnodo-newtonic.com/diego-velazquez-famous-paintings|access-date=21 November 2020|language=en-US}}</ref>

[[Francisco Goya]] painted during a historical period that includes the [[Peninsular War|Spanish Independence War]], the fights between liberals and absolutists, and the rise of contemporary nations-states.{{citation needed|date=October 2020}}

[[Joaquín Sorolla]] is a well-known modern impressionist painter and there are many important Spanish painters belonging to the modernism art movement, including [[Pablo Picasso]], [[Salvador Dalí]], [[Juan Gris]] and [[Joan Miró]].{{citation needed|date=October 2020}}

=== Sculpture ===
[[File:Chillida-peine.jpg|thumb|''The Comb of the Wind'' of [[Eduardo Chillida]] in [[San Sebastián]]]]

The Plateresque style extended from beginnings of the 16th century until the last third of the century and its stylistic influence pervaded the works of all great Spanish artists of the time. [[Alonso Berruguete]] ([[Valladolid]] School) is called the "Prince of Spanish sculpture". His main works were the upper stalls of the choir of the [[Cathedral of Toledo]], the tomb of Cardinal Tavera in the same Cathedral, and the altarpiece of the Visitation in the church of Santa Úrsula in the same locality. Other notable sculptors were [[Bartolomé Ordóñez]], [[Diego de Siloé]], [[Juan de Juni]] and [[Damià Forment|Damián Forment]].{{citation needed|date=October 2020}}

There were two Schools of special flair and talent: the [[Sevillian school of sculpture|Seville School]], to which [[Juan Martínez Montañés]] belonged, whose most celebrated works are the Crucifix in the Cathedral of Seville, another in Vergara, and a Saint John; and the [[Granadan school of sculpture|Granada School]], to which [[Alonso Cano]] belonged, to whom an Immaculate Conception and a Virgin of Rosary, are attributed.{{citation needed|date=October 2020}}

Other notable Andalusian Baroque sculptors were [[Pedro de Mena]], [[Pedro Roldán]] and his daughter [[Luisa Roldán]], [[Juan de Mesa]] and [[Pedro Duque Cornejo]]. In the 20th century the most important Spanish sculptors were [[Julio González (sculptor)|Julio González]], [[Pablo Gargallo]], [[Eduardo Chillida]], and [[Pablo Serrano]].

Spanish cinema has also seen international success over the years with films by directors like [[Segundo de Chomón]], [[Florián Rey]], [[Luis García Berlanga]], [[Carlos Saura]], [[Julio Medem]], [[Isabel Coixet]], [[Alejandro Amenábar]], [[Icíar Bollaín]] and brothers [[David Trueba]] and [[Fernando Trueba]].{{citation needed|date=October 2020}}

Actresses [[Sara Montiel]] and [[Penélope Cruz]] or actor [[Antonio Banderas]] are among those who have become [[Cinema in the United States|Hollywood]] stars.

International Film Festivals of [[Seminci|Valladolid]] and [[San Sebastián International Film Festival|San Sebastian]] are the oldest and more relevant in Spain.{{citation needed|date=October 2020}}

=== Architecture ===

[[File:Hemispheric - Valencia, Spain - Jan 2007.jpg|thumb|The Hemispheric at the [[Ciutat de les Arts i les Ciències]] in Valencia and [[Hanging houses of Cuenca]]]]
Due to its historical and geographical diversity, Spanish architecture has drawn from a host of influences. An important provincial city founded by the Romans and with an extensive [[Roman era]] infrastructure, [[Córdoba, Spain|Córdoba]] became the cultural capital, including fine Arabic style architecture, during the time of the Islamic [[Umayyad dynasty]].<ref>{{cite book|first=Jo|last=Cruz|title=Western Views of Islam in Medieval and Early Modern Europe: Perception and Other|url=https://archive.org/details/westernviewsisla00fras|url-access=limited|editor= David R. Blanks  |editor2=Michael Frassetto|location=New York|publisher=Saint Martin's Press|year=1999|page=[https://archive.org/details/westernviewsisla00fras/page/n68 56]}}</ref> Later Arab style architecture continued to be developed under successive Islamic dynasties, ending with the [[Nasrid dynasty|Nasrid]], which built its famed palace complex in [[Granada]].{{citation needed|date=October 2020}}

Simultaneously, the Christian kingdoms gradually emerged and developed their own styles; developing a [[pre-Romanesque]] style when for a while isolated from contemporary mainstream European architectural influences during the earlier Middle Ages, they later integrated the [[Romanesque architecture|Romanesque]] and [[Gothic architecture|Gothic]] streams. There was then an extraordinary flowering of the Gothic style that resulted in numerous instances being built throughout the entire territory. The [[Mudéjar]] style, from the 12th to 17th centuries, was developed by introducing Arab style motifs, patterns and elements into European architecture.{{citation needed|date=October 2020}}

The arrival of [[Modernism]] in the academic arena produced much of the architecture of the 20th century. An influential style centred in [[Barcelona]], known as [[modernisme]], produced a number of important architects, of which [[Gaudí]] is one. The [[International Style (architecture)|International style]] was led by groups like [[GATEPAC]]. Spain is currently experiencing a revolution in [[contemporary architecture]] and [[:Category:Spanish architects|Spanish architects]] like [[Rafael Moneo]], [[Santiago Calatrava]], [[Ricardo Bofill]] as well as many others have gained worldwide renown.{{citation needed|date=October 2020}}

=== Music and dance ===
{{Main|Music of Spain}}
[[File:Belen maya.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Flamenco]] is an Andalusian artistic form that evolved from the [[Seguidilla]].]]

Spanish music is often considered abroad to be synonymous with [[flamenco]], a West Andalusian musical genre, which, contrary to popular belief, is not widespread outside that region. Various regional styles of [[folk music]] abound in Aragon, Catalonia, Valencia, Castile, the Basque Country, Galicia, Cantabria and Asturias. Pop, rock, hip hop and heavy metal are also popular.

In the field of classical music, Spain has produced a number of noted composers such as [[Isaac Albéniz]], [[Manuel de Falla]] and [[Enrique Granados]] and singers and performers such as [[Plácido Domingo]], [[José Carreras]], [[Montserrat Caballé]], [[Alicia de Larrocha]], [[Alfredo Kraus]], [[Pablo Casals]], [[Ricardo Viñes]], [[José Iturbi]], [[Pablo de Sarasate]], [[Jordi Savall]] and [[Teresa Berganza]]. In Spain there are over forty professional orchestras, including the [[Barcelona Symphony and Catalonia National Orchestra|Orquestra Simfònica de Barcelona]], [[Orquesta Nacional de España]] and the [[Orquesta Sinfónica de Madrid]]. Major [[opera houses]] include the [[Teatro Real]], the [[Gran Teatre del Liceu]], [[Teatro Arriaga]] and the [[El Palau de les Arts Reina Sofía]].

Spanish cuisine consists of a great variety of dishes which stem from differences in geography, culture and climate. It is heavily influenced by seafood available from the waters that surround the country, and reflects the country's deep [[Mediterranean]] roots. Spain's extensive history with many cultural influences has led to a unique cuisine. In particular, three main divisions are easily identified:

'''''Mediterranean''''' Spain – all such coastal regions, from Catalonia to Andalusia – heavy use of seafood, such as ''pescaíto frito'' (fried fish); several cold soups like ''[[gazpacho]]''; and many rice-based dishes like ''[[paella]]'' from Valencia<ref name="paella" /> and ''[[arròs negre]]'' (black rice) from Catalonia.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.villagevoice.com/2009-12-01/restaurants/spain-gain-at-mercat-negre/ |title=Spain Gain at Mercat Negre |work=The Village Voice |date=1 December 2009 |last=DiGregorio |first=Sarah |location=New York |access-date=6 August 2010 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091208050334/http://www.villagevoice.com/2009-12-01/restaurants/spain-gain-at-mercat-negre/ |archive-date=8 December 2009 }}</ref>

'''''Inner''''' Spain – Castile – hot, thick soups such as the bread and garlic-based ''Castilian soup'', along with substantial stews such as ''[[cocido madrileño]]''. Food is traditionally conserved by salting, such as [[Spanish ham]], or immersed in [[olive oil]], such as [[Manchego cheese]].

'''''Atlantic''''' Spain – the whole Northern coast, including [[Asturian cuisine|Asturian]], [[Basque cuisine|Basque]], [[Cantabrian cuisine|Cantabrian]] and [[Galician cuisine]] – vegetable and fish-based stews like ''[[caldo gallego]]'' and ''[[marmitako]]''. Also, the lightly cured ''[[Lacón Gallego|lacón]]'' ham. The best known cuisine of the northern countries often rely on ocean seafood, as in the Basque-style [[cod]], [[albacore]] or [[anchovy]] or the Galician octopus-based ''[[polbo á feira]]'' and shellfish dishes.

=== Sport ===
{{Main|Sport in Spain}}
[[File:2010 FIFA World Cup Spain with cup.JPG|thumb|200px|Football is the most popular sport in the country. Spain won the [[FIFA World Cup 2010]].]]

While varieties of football have been played in Spain as far back as Roman times, sport in Spain has been dominated by football since the early 20th century. [[Real Madrid C.F.]] and [[FC Barcelona]] are two of the most successful football clubs in the world. [[Spain national football team|The country's national football team]] won the [[UEFA European Football Championship]] in 1964, 2008 and 2012 and the [[FIFA World Cup]] in [[2010 FIFA World Cup|2010]], and is the first team ever to win three back-to-back major international tournaments.{{citation needed|date=October 2020}}

[[Basketball]], [[tennis]], cycling, [[team handball|handball]], [[Spain national futsal team|futsal]], [[motorcycling]] and, lately, [[Formula One]] also can boast of Spanish champions. Today, Spain is a major world sports powerhouse, especially since the [[1992 Summer Olympics]] that were hosted in [[Barcelona]], which stimulated a great deal of interest in sports in the country. The tourism industry has led to an improvement in sports infrastructure, especially for [[water sports]], [[golf]] and [[skiing]]. In their respective regions, the traditional games of [[Basque pelota]] and [[Valencian pilota]] both are popular.{{citation needed|date=October 2020}}

=== Public holidays and festivals ===
{{Main|National Day of Spain|Public holidays in Spain|Fiestas of International Tourist Interest of Spain|Fiestas of National Tourist Interest of Spain}}
[[File:Encierro en la calle Mercaderes.jpg|thumb|[[San Fermín]] festival, [[Pamplona]]]]

Public holidays celebrated in Spain include a mix of religious ([[Roman Catholic]]), national and local observances. Each municipality is allowed to declare a maximum of 14 public holidays per year; up to nine of these are chosen by the national government and at least two are chosen locally.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bank-holidays.com/holidays_2007_58.htm|title=Bank holidays in Spain|publisher=bank-holidays.com|access-date=13 August 2008|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080918001803/http://www.bank-holidays.com/holidays_2007_58.htm|archive-date=18 September 2008}}</ref> [[National Day of Spain|Spain's National Day]] (''Fiesta Nacional de España'') is celebrated on 12 October, the anniversary of the [[Exploration of North America|Discovery of America]] and commemorate [[Our Lady of the Pillar]] feast, patroness of [[Aragon]] and throughout Spain.{{citation needed|date=October 2020}}

There are many festivals and festivities in Spain. Some of them are known worldwide, and millions of tourits from all over the world go to Spain annually to experience one of these festivals. One of the most famous is [[San Fermín]], in [[Pamplona]]. While its most famous event is the ''encierro'', or the [[running of the bulls]], which happens at 8:00&nbsp;am from 7 July to 14 July, the seven days-long celebration involves many other traditional and folkloric events. The events were central to the plot of The Sun Also Rises, by [[Ernest Hemingway]], which brought it to the general attention of English-speaking people. As the result, it has become one of the most internationally renowned fiestas in Spain, with over 1,000,000 people attending every year.

Other festivals include: [[La Tomatina]] tomato festival in [[Buñol]], [[Valencian Community|Valencia]], the carnivals in the [[Canary Islands]], the [[Falles]] in [[Valencia]] or the [[Holy Week]] in Andalusia and [[Castile and León]].

== Etymology ==
[[File:The Perugia Altarpiece, Side Panel Depicting St. Dominic.jpg|thumb|125px|left|St Dominic, after whom the country is named]]
The "Dominican" word comes from the Latin ''Dominicus'', meaning Sunday. However, the island has this name by [[Saint Dominic|Santo Domingo de Guzmán]] (Saint Dominic), founder of the Order of the [[Dominican Order|Dominicans]].<ref name="CIADemo"/>

The Dominican Order established a house of high studies on the colony of [[Santo Domingo]] that is now known as the [[Universidad Autónoma de Santo Domingo]], and dedicated themselves to the protection of the native Taíno people, who were subjected to slavery, and to the education of the inhabitants of the island.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.laromanabayahibenews.com/2012/06/gentilicio-dominicano-origen-etimologico-motivaciones-historicas-por-giancarlo-d%E2%80%99alessandro-i-bandera-es-tu-bandera-proyecto-de-exposiciones-fotograficas-itinerantes-por-frank-luna/ |title=Gentilicio Dominicano: Origen Etimológico & Motivaciones Históricas.

For most of its history, up until independence, the colony was known as ''{{lang|es|Santo Domingo}}''<ref name=firstcolony>{{cite web |url=http://countrystudies.us/dominican-republic/3.htm |title=Dominican Republic&nbsp;– The first colony |access-date=June 19, 2008 |work=Country Studies |publisher=[[Library of Congress]]; Federal Research Division}}</ref> – the name of its present capital and patron saint, [[Saint Dominic]] – and continued to be commonly known as such in English until the early 20th century.<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=CLpoeD3cbBkC&pg=PA1#v=onepage Hand Book of Santo Domingo:] Bulletin, Issue 52.

In the [[National Anthem of the Dominican Republic|national anthem of the Dominican Republic]] ({{lang|es|himno nacional de la República Dominicana}}), the term "Dominicans" does not appear. The author of its lyrics, [[Emilio Prud'Homme]], consistently uses the poetic term "Quisqueyans" ({{lang|es|Quisqueyanos}}). The word "Quisqueya" derives from the [[Taíno language]], and means "mother of the lands" ({{lang|es|madre de las tierras}}). It is often used in songs as another name for the country. The name of the country in English is often shortened to "the D.R."

[[Christopher Columbus]] arrived on the island on December 5, 1492, during the first of his [[Voyages of Christopher Columbus|four voyages]] to the Americas. He claimed the land for Spain and named it ''La Española'', due to its diverse climate and terrain, which reminded him of the [[Spain|Spanish landscape]].<ref>[http://www.catholictradition.org/Tradition/christopher-columbus.htm Christopher Columbus]. Catholictradition.org. Retrieved on April 2, 2014.</ref> Traveling further east, Columbus came across the [[Yaque del Norte River]], in the [[Cibao]] region, which he named Rio de Oro after discovering [[gold]] deposits nearby.<ref name=Ferdinand>{{cite book|last1=Columbus|first1=Ferdinand|title=The Life of the Admiral Christopher Columbus by his son Ferdinand|date=1959|publisher=Rutgers, The State University|location=New Brunswick|pages=76–77, 83, 87}}</ref> On Columbus's return during his second voyage, he established the settlement of [[La Isabela]] in what is now [[Puerto Plata province|Puerto Plata]] in January 1494, while he sent [[Alonso de Ojeda]] to search for gold in the region.

In 1496, [[Bartholomew Columbus]], Christopher's brother, built the city of [[Santo Domingo]], Western Europe's first permanent settlement in the "[[New World]]". The colony thus became the springboard for the further [[Spanish colonization of the Americas|Spanish conquest of the Americas]], and for decades, the [[captaincy general of santo domingo|headquarters]] of Spanish colonial power in the hemisphere. Soon after, the largest discovery of gold in the island was made in the [[Cordillera Central, Dominican Republic|cordillera central]] region, which led to a mining boom. By 1501, Columbus's cousin Giovanni Columbus had also discovered gold near Buenaventura; the deposits were later known as Minas Nuevas. Two major mining areas resulted, one along [[San Cristóbal, Dominican Republic|San Cristóbal]]-Buenaventura and another in Cibao within the [[La Vega, Dominican Republic|La Vega]]-Cotuy-[[Bonao]] triangle, while [[Santiago de los Caballeros]], [[La Vega, Dominican Republic|Concepcion]], and Bonao became mining towns.  The [[gold rush]] of 1500–1508 ensued.<ref name="Floyd">{{cite book |last1=Floyd |first1=Troy |title=The Columbus Dynasty in the Caribbean, 1492–1526 |date=1973 |publisher=University of New Mexico Press |location=Albuquerque |pages=44, 50, 57–58, 74}}</ref> [[Ferdinand II of Aragon]] "ordered gold from the richest mines reserved for the Crown." Thus, Ovando expropriated the gold mines of Miguel Diaz and Francisco de Garay in 1504, as pit mines became royal mines, though [[placer mining|placers]] were open to private prospectors. Furthermore, Ferdinand wanted the "best Indians" working his royal mines, and kept 967 in the San Cristóbal mining area, supervised by salaried miners.<ref name=Floyd/>{{rp|68,71,78,125–127}}

Under [[Nicolás de Ovando y Cáceres]]' governorship, the Indians were made to work in the gold mines, "where they were grossly overworked, mistreated, and underfed," according to Pons.  By 1503, the Spanish Crown legalized the distribution of Indians to work the mines, as part of the [[encomienda]] system.  According to Pons, "Once the Indians entered the mines, hunger and disease literally wiped them out."  By 1508, the Indian population of about 400,000 was reduced to 60,000, and by 1514, only 26,334 remained.  About half were located in the mining towns of Concepción, Santiago, Santo Domingo, and Buenaventura.  The [[repartimiento]] of 1514 accelerated emigration of the Spanish colonists, coupled with the exhaustion of the mines. In 1516, a smallpox epidemic killed an additional 8,000 of the remaining 11,000 Indians, in one month.  By 1519, according to Pons, "Both the gold economy and the Indian population became extinct at the same time."<ref name="Pons">{{cite book|last1=Pons|first1=Frank|title=The Dominican Republic, A National History|url=https://archive.org/details/dominicanrepubli00fran|url-access=registration|date=1995|publisher=Hispaniola Books|location=New Rochelle|isbn=978-1885509017|pages=[https://archive.org/details/dominicanrepubli00fran/page/33 33–37]}}</ref><ref name=Floyd/>{{rp|191–192}}

In 1501, the [[Catholic Monarchs]] first granted permission to the colonists of the Caribbean to import African slaves, who began arriving to the island in 1503. [[Sugar cane]] was introduced to Hispaniola from the [[Canary Islands]], and the first sugar mill in the New World was established in 1516, on Hispaniola.<ref>Sugar Cane: Past and Present, Peter Sharpe {{cite web |url=http://www.siu.edu/~ebl/leaflets/sugar.htm |title=Archived copy |access-date=2008-07-15 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080518084734/http://www.siu.edu/~ebl/leaflets/sugar.htm |archive-date=2008-05-18 }}</ref> The need for a labor force to meet the growing demands of sugar cane cultivation led to an exponential increase in the importation of slaves, over the following two decades. The sugar mill owners soon formed a new colonial elite and convinced the Spanish king to allow them to elect the members of the [[Real Audiencia]] from their ranks. Poorer colonists subsisted by hunting the herds of wild cattle that roamed throughout the island and selling their leather.

With the conquest of the American mainland, Hispaniola's sugar plantation economy quickly declined. Most Spanish colonists left for the silver-mines of [[Mexico]] and [[Peru]], while new immigrants from Spain bypassed the island. Agriculture dwindled, new imports of slaves ceased, and white colonists, free blacks, and slaves alike lived in poverty, weakening the racial hierarchy and aiding ''intermixing'', resulting in a population of predominantly mixed Spaniard, Taíno, and African descent. Except for the city of Santo Domingo, which managed to maintain some legal exports, Dominican ports were forced to rely on contraband trade, which, along with livestock, became one of the main sources of livelihood for the island's inhabitants.

In the mid-17th century, [[Kingdom of France|France]] sent colonists and [[privateers]] to settle the northwestern coast of Hispaniola due to its strategic position in the region. In order to entice the [[pirate]]s, France supplied them with women who had been taken from prisons, accused of prostitution and thieving. After decades of armed struggles with the French settlers, Spain ceded the western coast of the island to France with the 1697 [[Treaty of Ryswick]], whilst the Central Plateau remained under Spanish domain. France created a wealthy colony on the island, while the Spanish colony continued to suffer economic decline.<ref name="google48">{{cite book |editor-last=Knight |editor-first=Franklin W. |title=General history of the Caribbean |date=1997 |publisher=Unesco |location=London |isbn=978-92-3-103146-5 |page=48 |edition=1. publ. |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ppGJBmQVJjEC&pg=PR2 |access-date=30 April 2015}}</ref>

On April 17, 1655, English forces landed on Hispaniola and marched 30 miles overland to [[Santo Domingo]], the main Spanish stronghold on the island. Mounted [[lancer]]s attacked the invaders, sending them careening back toward the beach in utter confusion. Their commander hid behind a tree where, in the words of one disgusted observer, he was "so much possessed with terror that he could hardly speak." The elite [[Siege of Santo Domingo (1655)|defenders of Santo Domingo]] were amply rewarded with titles from the Spanish Crown. French forces attacked Santiago in 1667, and this was followed by a devastating hurricane the next year and a [[smallpox]] epidemic that killed about 1,500 in 1669. In 1687, the Spaniards captured the fort at Petit-Goave, but the French fought back and hanged their leaders. Two years later, in the Nine Years' War, the French sacked Santiago. In 1691, the Spaniards [[Battle of Sabana Real|attacked the north]] and sacked Cap-François. Island tensions subsided once peace was restored, and Spain's last Habsburg monarch — the deformed invalid [[Charles II of Spain|Charles II]] — died on November 1, 1700, being succeeded by the sixteen-year-old French Bourbon princeling Philip of Anjou.

=== 18th century ===
The [[House of Bourbon]] replaced the [[House of Habsburg]] in Spain in 1700, and introduced economic reforms that gradually began to revive trade in Santo Domingo. The crown progressively relaxed the rigid controls and restrictions on commerce between Spain and the colonies and among the colonies. The last ''flotas'' sailed in 1737; the monopoly port system was abolished shortly thereafter. By the middle of the century, the population was bolstered by the emigration of Spaniards from the [[Canary Islands]], resettling the northern part of the colony and planting tobacco in the [[Cibao Valley]], and importation of slaves was renewed. The colony of Santo Domingo saw a population increase during the 18th century, as it rose to about 91,272 in 1750. Of this number, approximately 38,272 were white landowners, 38,000 were free mixed people of color, and some 15,000 were slaves.{{cn|date=October 2020}} This contrasted sharply with the population of the French colony of Saint-Domingue (present-day Haiti)&nbsp;– the wealthiest colony in the Caribbean and whose population of one-half a million was 90% enslaved and overall, seven times as numerous as the Spanish colony of Santo Domingo.<ref name="google48"/><ref>{{cite web|url=http://countrystudies.us/dominican-republic/3.htm|title=Dominican Republic – THE FIRST COLONY|access-date=16 August 2016}}</ref> The 'Spanish' settlers, whose blood by now was mixed with that of Taínos, Africans, and Canary Guanches, proclaimed: 'It does not matter if the French are richer than us, we are still the true inheritors of this island.

When the [[War of Jenkins' Ear]] between Spain and Britain broke out in 1739, Spanish [[privateer]]s, particularly from Santo Domingo, began to patrol the Caribbean Sea, a development that lasted until the end of the eighteenth century. During this period, Spanish privateers from Santo Domingo sailed into enemy ports looking for ships to plunder, thus disrupting commerce between Britain and New York. As a result, the Spanish obtained stolen merchandise—foodstuffs, ships, enslaved persons—that were sold in Hispaniola's ports, with profits accruing to individual sea raiders. The revenue acquired in these acts of piracy was invested in the economic expansion of the colony and led to repopulation from Europe.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Ricourt|first1=Milagros|title=The Dominican Racial Imaginary: Surveying the Landscape of Race and Nation in Hispaniola|date=2016|publisher=Rutgers University Press|page=57}}</ref>

Between 1720 and 1774, Dominican privateers captured merchant and warships in the waters around Santo Domingo and [[Captaincy General of Puerto Rico|Puerto Rico]]. They were responsible for bringing hundreds of African slaves to the island.<ref>{{cite web |title=Corsairs of Santo Domingo a socio-economic study, 1718-1779 |url=https://ruor.uottawa.ca/bitstream/10393/4972/1/ML21744.PDF}}</ref> The most common type of ship used by the privateers was a sloop.

As restrictions on colonial trade were relaxed, the colonial elites of St. Domingue offered the principal market for Santo Domingo's exports of beef, hides, mahogany, and tobacco. With the outbreak of the [[Haitian Revolution]] in 1791, the rich urban families linked to the colonial bureaucracy fled the island, while most of the rural ''hateros'' (cattle ranchers) remained, even though they lost their principal market. Although the population of Spanish Santo Domingo was perhaps one-fourth that of French Saint-Domingue, this did not prevent the Spanish king from launching an invasion of the French side of the island in 1793, attempting to take advantage of the chaos sparked by the [[French Revolution]].<ref name=Scheina>{{cite book|last1=Scheina|first1=Robert L.|title=Latin America's Wars: Volume 1|date=2003|publisher=Potomac Books}}</ref> French forces checked Spanish progress toward Port-au-Prince in the south, but the Spanish pushed rapidly through the north, most of which they occupied by 1794. Although the Spanish military effort went well on Hispaniola, it did not in Europe (see [[War of the Pyrenees]]). As a consequence, Spain was forced to cede Santo Domingo to the French under the terms of the [[Peace of Basel|Treaty of Basel]] (July 22, 1795) in order to get the French to withdraw from Spain.

=== Independence from Spain (1821) ===
{{Main|España Boba|Republic of Spanish Haiti}}
After a dozen years of discontent and failed independence plots by various opposing groups, Santo Domingo's former Lieutenant-Governor (top administrator), [[José Núñez de Cáceres]], declared the colony's independence from the [[Spanish Empire|Spanish crown]] as [[Republic of Spanish Haiti|Spanish Haiti]], on November 30, 1821. This period is also known as the Ephemeral independence.<ref name="Bethell1986">{{cite book|author=H.

[[File:President Jean-Pierre Boyer of Haiti (Hispaniola Unification Regime) Portrait.jpg|thumb|upright=0.8|[[Jean-Pierre Boyer]], the ruler of Haiti]]

The newly independent republic ended two months later under the Haitian government led by [[Jean-Pierre Boyer]].<ref name="guitar">{{cite web |last = Guitar |first = Lynne |title = History of the Dominican Republic |publisher = Hola.com |url = http://www.hispaniola.com/dominican_republic/info/history.php |access-date = May 29, 2007 |url-status=dead |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20070601040005/http://www.hispaniola.com/dominican_republic/info/history.php |archive-date = June 1, 2007 |df = mdy-all }}</ref>

As Toussaint Louverture had done two decades earlier, the Haitians abolished slavery. In order to raise funds for the huge indemnity of 150 million francs that Haiti agreed to pay the former French colonists, and which was subsequently lowered to 60 million francs, the Haitian government imposed heavy taxes on the Dominicans. Since Haiti was unable to adequately provision its army, the occupying forces largely survived by commandeering or confiscating food and supplies at gunpoint. Attempts to [[Land reform|redistribute]] land conflicted with the system of communal land tenure (''terrenos comuneros''), which had arisen with the ranching economy, and some people resented being forced to grow cash crops under Boyer and [[Joseph Balthazar Inginac]]'s ''Code Rural''.{{efn|''Terrenos comuneros'' arose because of "scarce population, low value of the land, the absence of officials qualified to survey the lands, and the difficulty of dividing up the ranch in such a way that each would receive a share of the grasslands, forests, streams, palm groves, and small agricultural plots that, only when combined, made possible the exploitation of the ranch." (Hoetink, ''The Dominican People: Notes for a Historical Sociology'' transl. Stephen Ault Pg. 83 (Johns Hopkins Press: Baltimore, 1982)}} In the rural and rugged mountainous areas, the Haitian administration was usually too inefficient to enforce its own laws. It was in the city of Santo Domingo that the effects of the occupation were most acutely felt, and it was there that the movement for independence originated.

The Haitians associated the [[Roman Catholic Church]] with the French slave-masters who had exploited them before independence and confiscated all church property, deported all foreign clergy, and severed the ties of the remaining clergy to the [[Holy See|Vatican]]. All levels of education collapsed; the university was shut down, as it was starved both of resources and students, with young Dominican men from 16 to 25 years old being drafted into the Haitian army. Boyer's occupation troops, who were largely Dominicans, were unpaid and had to "forage and sack" from Dominican civilians. Haiti imposed a "heavy tribute" on the Dominican people.<ref name="Matibag" />{{rp|page number needed}}

Haiti's constitution forbade white elites from owning land, and Dominican major landowning families were forcibly deprived of their properties. During this time, many white elites in Santo Domingo did not consider owning slaves due to the economic crisis that Santo Domingo faced during the [[España Boba]] period. The few landowners that wanted slavery established in Santo Domingo had to emigrate to other colonies such as [[Cuba]], [[Puerto Rico]], or [[Gran Colombia]]. Many landowning families stayed on the island, with a heavy concentration of landowners settling in the [[cibao]] region. After independence, and eventually being under [[Spanish occupation of the Dominican Republic|Spanish rule]] once again in 1861, many families returned to Santo Domingo including new waves of immigration from [[Spain]].{{citation needed|date=July 2020}}

{{See also|Dominican War of Independence}}
[[File:Juan_pablo_duarte_diez.jpg|thumb|left|150px|[[Juan Pablo Duarte]], founding father of the Dominican Republic.]]
In 1838, [[Juan Pablo Duarte]] founded a secret society called [[La Trinitaria (Dominican Republic)|La Trinitaria]], which sought the complete independence of Santo Domingo without any foreign intervention.<ref name="pons">{{cite book |first=Frank |last =Moya Pons| author-link =Frank Moya Pons | title = The Dominican Republic: A National History|edition= August 1, 1998|page= 543 |publisher = Markus Wiener Publishers; 2nd edition| isbn= 978-1-55876-191-9|year =1998}}</ref>{{rp|p147–149}} Also [[Francisco del Rosario Sánchez]] and [[Ramon Matias Mella]], despite not being among the founding members of La Trinitaria, were decisive in the fight for independence.

The ''Trinitarios'' took advantage of a Haitian rebellion against the dictator Jean-Pierre Boyer. They rose up on January 27, 1843, ostensibly in support of the Haitian [[Charles Rivière-Hérard|Charles Hérard]] who was challenging Boyer for the control of Haiti. However, the movement soon discarded its pretext of support for Hérard and now championed Dominican independence. After overthrowing Boyer, Hérard executed some Dominicans, and threw many others into prison; Duarte escaped.<ref name=Scheina/> After subduing the Dominicans, Hérard, a mulatto, faced a rebellion by blacks in [[Port-au-Prince]]. Haiti had formed two regiments composed of Dominicans from the city of Santo Domingo; these were used by Hérard to suppress the uprising.<ref name=Scheina/>

[[File:Ramon Matias Mella.jpg|thumb|right|150px|[[Matías Ramón Mella]].]]
In 1844, the surviving members of ''La Trinitaria'', now led by [[Tomás Bobadilla]], chose [[Puerta del Conde|El Conde]], the prominent "Gate of the Count" in the old city walls, as the rallying point for their insurrection against the Haitian government. On the morning of February 27, 1844, El Conde rang with the shots of the plotters, who had emerged from their secret meetings to openly challenge the Haitians. Their efforts were successful, and for the next ten years, Dominican military strongmen fought to preserve their country's independence from their Haitian neighbors.

The ''Trinitarios'' were backed by [[Pedro Santana]], a wealthy cattle rancher from [[El Seibo]], who became general of the army of the nascent republic. The Dominican Republic's first [[Constitution of the Dominican Republic|Constitution]] was adopted on November 6, 1844, and was modeled after the [[United States Constitution]].<ref name="Encarta"/> The decades that followed were filled with tyranny, factionalism, economic difficulties, rapid changes of government, and exile for political opponents. Archrivals Santana and [[Buenaventura Báez]] held power most of the time, both ruling arbitrarily. They promoted competing plans to annex the new nation to another power: Santana favored Spain, and Báez the United States.

Threatening the nation's independence were renewed Haitian invasions. On March 19, 1844, the Haitian army, under the personal command of President Hérard, invaded the eastern province from the north and progressed as far as Santiago, but was soon forced to withdraw after suffering disproportionate losses. According to [[José María Imbert]]'s (the General defending Santiago) report of April 5, 1844 to Santo Domingo, "in Santiago, the enemy did not leave behind in the battlefield less than six hundred dead and...the number of wounded was very superior...[while on] our part we suffered not one casualty."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://etd.library.vanderbilt.edu/available/etd-03272011-220809/unrestricted/DePena.pdf|title=The Siblings of Hispaniola: Political Union and Separation of Haiti and Santo Domingo, 1822–1844|access-date=August 4, 2020}}</ref> 

The Dominicans repelled the Haitian forces, on both land and sea, by December 1845. The Haitians invaded again in 1849 after France recognized the Dominican Republic as an independent nation. Santana being called upon to assume command of the troops, met the enemy at Ocoa, April 21, 1849, with only 400 men, and succeeded in utterly defeating the Haitian army.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Hazard|first1=Samuel|title=Santo Domingo, Past And Present; With A Glance At Haytl|url=https://archive.org/details/santodomingopast00haza_0|date=1873|page=[https://archive.org/details/santodomingopast00haza_0/page/249 249]}}</ref> In November 1849, Báez launched a naval offensive against Haiti to forestall the threat of another invasion.<ref name=Scheina/> His seamen under the French adventurer, Fagalde, raided the Haitian coasts, plundered seaside villages, as far as Cape Dame Marie, and butchered crews of captured enemy ships.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Baur|first1=John E.|title=Faustin Soulouque, Emperor of Haiti His Character and His Reign|date=1949|page=143}}</ref> In 1855, Haiti invaded again, but its forces were repulsed at the [[Battle of Santomé]] in December 1855 and the [[Battle of Sabana Larga]] in January 1856.

The Dominican Republic's first [[Constitution of the Dominican Republic|constitution]] was adopted on November 6, 1844. The state was commonly known as Santo Domingo in English until the early 20th century.<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=CLpoeD3cbBkC&pg=PA1 Hand Book of Santo Domingo:] Bulletin, Issue 52. U.S. Government Printing Office, 1892. Digitized 14 August 2012. p. 3. ''"...the Republic of Santo Domingo or República Dominicana (Dominican Republic) as it is officially designated."''</ref>  It featured a presidential form of government with many liberal tendencies, but it was marred by Article 210, imposed by [[Pedro Santana]] on the constitutional assembly by force, giving him the privileges of a dictatorship until the war of independence was over. These privileges not only served him to win the war but also allowed him to persecute, execute and drive into exile his political opponents, among which Duarte was the most important. In Haiti after the fall of Boyer, black leaders had ascended to the power once enjoyed exclusively by the mulatto elite.<ref>{{cite book|title=Haitian-Dominican Counterpoint: Nation, State, and Race on Hispaniola|page=114}}</ref>

Due to the rugged mountainous terrain of the island the regions of the Dominican Republic developed in isolation from one another. In the south, also known at the time as Ozama, the economy was dominated by cattle-ranching (particularly in the southeastern savannah) and cutting mahogany and other hardwoods for export. This region retained a semi-feudal character, with little commercial agriculture, the hacienda as the dominant social unit, and the majority of the population living at a subsistence level. In the north (better-known as Cibao), the nation's richest farmland, farmers supplemented their subsistence crops by growing tobacco for export, mainly to Germany. Tobacco required less land than cattle ranching and was mainly grown by smallholders, who relied on itinerant traders to transport their crops to Puerto Plata and Monte Cristi. Santana antagonized the Cibao farmers, enriching himself and his supporters at their expense by resorting to multiple peso printings that allowed him to buy their crops for a fraction of their value. In 1848, he was forced to resign and was succeeded by his vice-president, [[Manuel Jimenes]].

After defeating a new Haitian invasion in 1849, Santana marched on Santo Domingo and deposed Jimenes in a coup d'état. At his behest, Congress elected Buenaventura Báez as President, but Báez was unwilling to serve as Santana's puppet, challenging his role as the country's acknowledged military leader. In 1853, Santana was elected president for his second term, forcing Báez into exile. Three years later, after repulsing another Haitian invasion, he negotiated a treaty leasing a portion of Samaná Peninsula to a U.S. company; popular opposition forced him to abdicate, enabling Báez to return and seize power. With the treasury depleted, Báez printed eighteen million uninsured pesos, purchasing the 1857 tobacco crop with this currency and exporting it for [[hard cash]] at immense profit to himself and his followers. Cibao tobacco planters, who were ruined when hyperinflation ensued, revolted and formed a new government headed by [[José Desiderio Valverde]] and headquartered in Santiago de los Caballeros. In July 1857 General [[Juan Luis Franco Bidó]] besieged Santo Domingo. The Cibao-based government declared an amnesty to exiles and Santana returned and managed to replace Franco Bidó in September 1857. After a year of civil war, Santana captured Santo Domingo in June 1858, overthrew both Báez and Valverde and installed himself as president.<ref name=Cross>{{cite book |title= Sociedad y desarrollo en República Dominicana, 1844–1899 |date= 1984 |last=Cross Beras |first=Julio A. |publisher=CENAPEC |isbn=978-84-89525-17-7}}</ref>

Báez was toppled in 1874, returned, and was toppled for good in 1878. A new generation was thence in charge, with the passing of Santana (he died in 1864) and Báez from the scene.

From 1902 on, short-lived governments were again the norm, with their power usurped by [[caudillo]]s in parts of the country. Furthermore, the national government was bankrupt and, unable to pay Heureaux's debts, faced the threat of military intervention by France and other European creditor powers.<ref name=cs9>{{cite web |url=http://countrystudies.us/dominican-republic/9.htm |title=Dominican Republic&nbsp;– Renewed conflict, 1899–1916 |access-date=October 19, 2008 |work=Country Studies |publisher=[[Library of Congress]]; Federal Research Division}}</ref>

United States President [[Theodore Roosevelt]] sought to prevent European intervention, largely to protect the routes to the future [[Panama Canal]], as the canal was already under construction. He made a small [[1916 United States occupation of the Dominican Republic|military intervention]] to ward off European powers, to proclaim his famous [[Roosevelt Corollary]] to the [[Monroe Doctrine]], and also to obtain his 1905 Dominican agreement for U.S. administration of Dominican customs, which was the chief source of income for the Dominican government. A 1906 agreement provided for the arrangement to last 50 years. The United States agreed to use part of the customs proceeds to reduce the immense foreign debt of the Dominican Republic and assumed responsibility for said debt.<ref name=Encarta/><ref name=cs9/>

[[File:Ramon Caceres.jpg|thumb|upright=0.7|[[Ramón Cáceres]]]]
After six years in power, President [[Ramón Cáceres]] (who had himself assassinated Heureaux)<ref name=countrystudies/> was assassinated in 1911. The result was several years of great political instability and civil war. U.S. mediation by the [[William Howard Taft]] and [[Woodrow Wilson]] administrations achieved only a short respite each time. A political deadlock in 1914 was broken after an ultimatum by Wilson telling the Dominicans to choose a president or see the U.S. impose one. A provisional president was chosen, and later the same year relatively free elections put former president (1899–1902) [[Juan Isidro Jimenes Pereyra]] back in power. To achieve a more broadly supported government, Jimenes named opposition individuals to his cabinet. But this brought no peace and, with his former [[Secretary of War]] [[Desiderio Arias]] maneuvering to depose him and despite a U.S. offer of military aid against Arias, Jimenes resigned on May 7, 1916.<ref name="congress">{{cite web| title=Dominican Republic: Occupation by the United States, 1916–1924| work=Country Studies| publisher=[[Library of Congress]]; Federal Research Division| url=http://countrystudies.us/dominican-republic/10.htm| access-date=May 29, 2007}}</ref>

Wilson thus ordered the U.S. occupation of the Dominican Republic. [[United States Marine Corps|U.S. Marines]] landed on May 16, 1916, and had control of the country two months later. The military government established by the U.S., led by Vice Admiral [[Harry Shepard Knapp]], was widely repudiated by the Dominicans, with many factions within the country leading guerrilla campaigns against U.S. forces.<ref name="congress"/> The occupation regime kept most Dominican laws and institutions and largely pacified the general population.

Vigorous opposition to the occupation continued, nevertheless,{{cn|date=December 2020}} and after World War I it increased in the U.S. as well. There, President [[Warren G. Harding]] (1921–23), Wilson's successor, worked to put an end to the occupation, as he had promised to do during his campaign. The U.S. government's rule ended in October 1922, and elections were held in March 1924.<ref name="congress"/>
[[File:Horacio Vasquez.jpg|thumb|right|upright=0.9|[[Horacio Vásquez]]]]
The victor was former president (1902–03) [[Horacio Vásquez]], who had cooperated with the U.S. He was inaugurated on July 13, 1924 and the last U.S. forces left in September. In six years, the Marines were involved in at least 467 engagements, with 950 insurgents killed or wounded in action.<ref>{{cite web|title=THE CARIBBEAN WAR.

During the government of Horacio Vásquez, [[Rafael Trujillo]] held the rank of lieutenant colonel and was chief of police. This position helped him launch his plans to overthrow the government of Vásquez. Trujillo had the support of Carlos Rosario Peña, who formed the Civic Movement, which had as its main objective to overthrow the government of Vásquez.

In February 1930, when Vásquez attempted to win another term, his opponents rebelled in secret alliance with the commander of the National Army (the former National Guard), General [[Rafael Trujillo|Rafael Leonidas Trujillo Molina]]. Trujillo secretly cut a deal with rebel leader [[Rafael Estrella Ureña]]; in return for letting Ureña take power, Trujillo would be allowed to run for president in new elections. As the rebels marched toward Santo Domingo, Vásquez ordered Trujillo to suppress them. However, feigning "neutrality," Trujillo kept his men in barracks, allowing Ureña's rebels to take the capital virtually uncontested. On March 3, Ureña was proclaimed acting president with Trujillo confirmed as head of the police and the army.

As per their agreement, Trujillo became the presidential nominee of the newly formed Patriotic Coalition of Citizens (Spanish: Coalición patriotica de los ciudadanos), with Ureña as his running mate. During the election campaign, Trujillo used the army to unleash his repression, forcing his opponents to withdraw from the race. Trujillo stood to elect himself, and in May he was elected president virtually unopposed after a violent campaign against his opponents, ascending to power on August 16, 1930.

=== Trujillo Era (1930–61) ===
[[File:Rafel Trujillo 1934.jpg|thumb|upright=1.15|[[Rafael Trujillo]] imposed a dictatorship of 31 years in the country (1930–1961)]]

There was considerable economic growth during [[Rafael Trujillo]]'s long and iron-fisted regime, although a great deal of the wealth was taken by the dictator and other regime elements. There was progress in healthcare, education, and transportation, with the building of hospitals and clinics, schools, and roads and harbors. Trujillo also carried out an important housing construction program and instituted a pension plan. He finally negotiated an undisputed border with Haiti in 1935 and achieved the end of the 50-year customs agreement in 1941, instead of 1956. He made the country debt-free in 1947.<ref name=Encarta/><ref name=Galvan>{{cite book |author=Javier A.

Trujillo's dictatorship was marred by botched invasions, international scandals and assassination attempts. 1947 brought the failure of a planned invasion by leftist Dominican exiles from the Cuban island of Cayo Confites. July 1949 was the year of a failed invasion from [[Guatemala]], and on June 14, 1959, there was a failed invasion at [[Constanza, Dominican Republic|Constanza]], Maimón and Estero Hondo by Dominican rebels from Cuba.

On November 25, 1960, Trujillo killed three of the four [[Mirabal sisters]], nicknamed ''Las Mariposas'' (The Butterflies). The victims were Patria Mercedes Mirabal (born on February 27, 1924), Argentina Minerva Mirabal (born on March 12, 1926), and Antonia María Teresa Mirabal (born on October 15, 1935). Along with their husbands, the sisters were conspiring to overthrow Trujillo in a violent revolt. The Mirabals had communist ideological leanings, as did their husbands. The sisters have received many honors posthumously and have many memorials in various cities in the Dominican Republic. Salcedo, their home province, changed its name to [[Hermanas Mirabal Province|Provincia Hermanas Mirabal]] (Mirabal Sisters Province). The [[International Day for the Elimination of Violence against Women]] is observed on the anniversary of their deaths.

For a long time, the U.S. and the Dominican elite supported the Trujillo government. This support persisted despite the assassinations of political opposition, the massacre of Haitians, and Trujillo's plots against other countries. The U.S. believed Trujillo was the lesser of two or more evils.<ref name="Wucker"/> The U.S. finally broke with Trujillo in 1960, after Trujillo's agents attempted to assassinate the Venezuelan president, [[Rómulo Betancourt]], a fierce critic of Trujillo.<ref name=locdr11/><ref>{{cite news |url=http://content.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,826562,00.html |title=Trying to Topple Trujillo |work=[[Time (magazine)|Time]] |date=5 September 1960 |access-date=26 December 2007}}</ref>

It was, however, praised for an ambitious infrastructure program, which included the construction of large housing projects, sports complexes, theaters, museums, aqueducts, roads, highways, and the massive [[Columbus Lighthouse]], completed in 1992 during a later tenure. During Balaguer's administration, the Dominican military forced Haitians to cut sugarcane on Dominican sugar plantations ([[Batey (sugar workers' town)|bateyes]]).<ref>{{cite book |last1=Pope Atkins |first1=G. |title=The Dominican Republic and the United States: From Imperialism to Transnationalism |page=205}}</ref>

In 1978, Balaguer was succeeded in the presidency by opposition candidate [[Antonio Guzmán Fernández]], of the [[Dominican Revolutionary Party]] (PRD). Another PRD win in 1982 followed, under [[Salvador Jorge Blanco]]. Balaguer regained the presidency in 1986 and was re-elected in 1990 and 1994, this last time just defeating PRD candidate [[José Francisco Peña Gómez]], a former mayor of Santo Domingo.<!--some info needs to be added about Balaguer's performance 1986-96-->

The 1994 elections were flawed, bringing on international pressure, to which Balaguer responded by scheduling another presidential contest in 1996. Balaguer was not a candidate.

In the 1996, with the support of Joaquín Balaguer and the Social Christian Reform Party in a coalition called the Patriotic Front, [[Leonel Fernández]] achieved the first-ever win for the [[Dominican Liberation Party]] (PLD),<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1996/07/02/world/lawyer-raised-in-new-york-to-lead-dominican-republic.html |title=Lawyer Raised in New York to Lead Dominican Republic |last=Rohter |first=Larry |date=1996-07-02 |work=The New York Times |access-date=2018-11-21}}</ref> which Bosch had founded in 1973 after leaving the PRD (which he also had founded). Fernández oversaw a fast-growing economy: growth averaged 7.7% per year, unemployment fell, and there were stable exchange and inflation rates.<ref name=coha/>
His administration supported the process of modernizing the judicial system, making transparent the creation of an independent Supreme Court of Justice. Efforts were also made to reform and modernize the other state bodies. In addition, relations with Cuba were reestablished and the Free Trade Agreement with Central America was signed, which was the genesis for the signing of DR-CAFTA.

In 2000, the PRD's [[Hipólito Mejía]] won the election. This was a time of economic troubles.<ref name=coha/> Neverthelss, his government was marked by major economic and social reforms, apart from a decentralization of the national budget. Among the laws created in this period are the Social Security, the Monetary and Financial Code, the Stock Market, Electricity, Electronic Commerce, the Police Law, the Environment, Public Health, the Chamber of Accounts, the Insurance Law, Administrative Independence and Budgetary of the Legislative Power and Judicial Power; in addition, creation of the Santo Domingo Province and its municipalities, a larger budget for municipalities, as well as other laws. This meant in the 2002 elections, obtaining a congressional and municipal majority. During this period, great sports structures were built for the 2003 Pan American Games. Under Mejía, the Dominican Republic participated in the US-led coalition, as part of the Multinational Brigade Plus Ultra, during the 2003 invasion of Iraq, suffering no casualties. In 2004 , the country withdrew its approximately 300 soldiers from Iraq. The government of President Mejía had to negotiate the Free Trade Agreement with the United States, the main trading partner. He also promoted various commercial measures, popularly called "Economic Package". This "package" was accompanied by a series of social measures, such as aid to agricultural producers, subsidies to electricity rates, construction of streets, sidewalks, local roads, etc., as well as subsidies to poor families whose children attended schools, as well as the creation of new taxes and increases in existing ones.

In 2003 the effects of the bankruptcy of three banking entities whose savers were protected by the government who financed this situation by creating inflation. This caused a strong economic crisis accompanied by the devaluation of the currency and capital outflows, instability that led to the bankruptcy of many companies. With the congressional majority obtained in 2002, President Mejía promoted a constitutional reform that restored the possibility of presidential reelection, which had been abolished in 1994 at the request of his own party. This reform caused problems within his party causing a division within its main leaders.
[[File:DM16Ago.png|thumb|left|President [[Danilo Medina]] was president from 2012 to 2020.]]
Mejía was defeated in his re-election effort in 2004 by Leonel Fernández of the PLD who won with 57.11% of the votes the presidential elections. At the beginning of his second presidential term, he made an effort to combat the economic crisis, reestablishing macroeconomic stability, manifesting among other things through the reduction of the dollar exchange rate and the return of confidence in the economy. On the other hand, his administrations was accused of corruption. President Fernández's management consisted of improving Santo Domingo's collective transport system, the first Metro line was built; the completion of the main communication routes to the country's tourist poles; the construction of new schools or the construction of more classrooms, as well as the provision of computer centers with modern computers and Internet to the communities in coordination with schools, churches or clubs. It continued its program of modernization of the state, strengthening the formulation and execution of the budget and promoting laws to make the public acquisition of goods and services transparent.

In 2008, Fernández was as elected for a third term.<ref name="ussdnote" /> Fernández and the PLD are credited with initiatives that have moved the country forward technologically, on the other hand, his administrations have been accused of corruption.<ref name="coha" /> [[Danilo Medina]] of the PLD was elected president in 2012 and re-elected in 2016.

== Geography ==
{{main|Geography of the Dominican Republic}}
[[File:Dominican Republic relief location map.jpg|thumb|upright=1.35|Topographical map of Dominican Republic]]
The Dominican Republic comprises the eastern five-eighths of [[Hispaniola]], the second-largest island in the [[Greater Antilles]], with the [[Atlantic Ocean]] to the north and the [[Caribbean Sea]] to the south. It shares the island roughly at a 2:1 ratio with [[Haiti]], the north-to-south (though somewhat irregular) border between the two countries being {{convert|376|km|mi|abbr=on}}.<ref name="CIADemo" /> To the north and north-west lie [[The Bahamas]] and the [[Turks and Caicos Islands]], and to the east, across the [[Mona Passage]], the US Commonwealth of [[Puerto Rico]]. The country's area is reported variously as {{convert|48442|km²|0|abbr=on}} (by the embassy in the United States)<ref name="embassy" /> and {{convert|48670|km²|0|abbr=on}},<ref name="CIADemo" /> making it the second largest country in the [[Antilles]], after [[Cuba]]. The Dominican Republic's capital and largest city [[Santo Domingo]] is on the southern coast.<ref name="CIADemo" />

[[File:Constanza (15196384558).jpg|thumb|[[Constanza, Dominican Republic|Constanza]] valley]]
The Dominican Republic has four important mountain ranges. The most northerly is the ''[[Cordillera Septentrional]]'' ("Northern Mountain Range"), which extends from the northwestern coastal town of [[San Fernando de Monte Cristi|Monte Cristi]], near the Haitian border, to the [[Samaná Peninsula]] in the east, running parallel to the Atlantic coast. The highest range in the Dominican Republic&nbsp;– indeed, in the whole of the West Indies&nbsp;– is the ''[[Cordillera Central, Dominican Republic|Cordillera Central]]'' ("Central Mountain Range"). It gradually bends southwards and finishes near the town of [[Azua de Compostela|Azua]], on the Caribbean coast. In the Cordillera Central are the four highest peaks in the Caribbean: [[Pico Duarte]] ({{convert|3098|m|ft|0|disp=or}} above sea level),<ref name="CIADemo" /> La Pelona ({{convert|3094|m|ft|0|disp=or}}), La Rucilla ({{convert|3049|m|ft|0|disp=or}}), and Pico Yaque ({{convert|2760|m|ft|0|disp=or}}). In the southwest corner of the country, south of the Cordillera Central, there are two other ranges: the more northerly of the two is the ''[[Sierra de Neiba]]'', while in the south the ''[[Sierra de Bahoruco]]'' is a continuation of the [[Massif de la Selle]] in Haiti. There are other, minor mountain ranges, such as the ''Cordillera Oriental'' ("Eastern Mountain Range"), ''Sierra Martín García'', ''Sierra de Yamasá'', and ''Sierra de Samaná''.

Between the Central and Northern mountain ranges lies the rich and fertile [[Cibao]] valley. This major valley is home to the cities of [[Santiago de los Caballeros|Santiago]] and [[Concepción de La Vega|La Vega]] and most of the farming areas of the nation. Rather less productive are the semi-arid San Juan Valley, south of the Central Cordillera, and the Neiba Valley, tucked between the Sierra de Neiba and the Sierra de Bahoruco. Much of the land around the [[Lake Enriquillo|Enriquillo]] Basin is below sea level, with a hot, arid, desert-like environment. There are other smaller valleys in the mountains, such as the [[Constanza, Dominican Republic|Constanza]], [[Jarabacoa]], [[Villa Altagracia]], and [[Bonao]] valleys.

The ''Llano Costero del Caribe'' ("Caribbean Coastal Plain") is the largest of the plains in the Dominican Republic. Stretching north and east of Santo Domingo, it contains many sugar plantations in the [[savannah]]s that are common there. West of Santo Domingo its width is reduced to {{convert|10|km|mi}} as it hugs the coast, finishing at the mouth of the Ocoa River. Another large plain is the ''Plena de Azua'' ("Azua Plain"), a very arid region in [[Azua Province]]. A few other small coastal plains are on the northern coast and in the [[Pedernales Province|Pedernales]] Peninsula.
[[File:Dominican republic Los Haitises mangroves.jpeg|thumb|left|Mangroves in Los Haitises National Park]]
Four major rivers drain the numerous mountains of the Dominican Republic. The [[Yaque del Norte River|Yaque del Norte]] is the longest and most important Dominican river. It carries excess water down from the Cibao Valley and empties into Monte Cristi Bay, in the northwest. Likewise, the [[Yuna River]] serves the Vega Real and empties into Samaná Bay, in the northeast. Drainage of the San Juan Valley is provided by the San Juan River, [[tributary]] of the [[Yaque del Sur]], which empties into the Caribbean, in the south. The [[Artibonite River|Artibonito]] is the longest river of Hispaniola and flows westward into Haiti.

There are many lakes and coastal lagoons. The largest lake is [[Lake Enriquillo|Enriquillo]], a [[salt lake]] at {{convert|45|m|ft|0}} below sea level, the lowest elevation in the Caribbean.<ref name="CIADemo" /> Other important lakes are [[Laguna de Rincón]] or Cabral, with [[freshwater|fresh water]], and [[Laguna de Oviedo]], a lagoon with [[brackish water]].

There are many small offshore islands and [[cay]]s that form part of the Dominican territory. The two largest islands near shore are [[Saona Island|Saona]], in the southeast, and [[Beata]], in the southwest. Smaller islands include the [[Cayos Siete Hermanos]], [[Isla Cabra]], [[Cayo Jackson]], [[Cayo Limón]], [[Cayo Levantado]], [[Cayo la Bocaina]], [[Catalina Island (Dominican Republic)|Catalanita]], [[Cayo Pisaje]] and [[Isla Alto Velo]]. To the north, at distances of {{convert|100|-|200|km|mi|0}}, are three extensive, largely submerged [[Bank (topography)|banks]], which geographically are a southeast continuation of [[the Bahamas]]: [[Navidad Bank]], [[Silver Bank]], and [[Mouchoir Bank]]. Navidad Bank and Silver Bank have been officially claimed by the Dominican Republic.{{citation needed|date=August 2019}} [[Isla Cabritos]] lies within [[Lago Enriquillo]].

The Dominican Republic is located near fault action in the Caribbean. In 1946, it suffered [[1946 Dominican Republic earthquake|a magnitude 8.1 earthquake]] off the northeast coast, triggering a [[tsunami]] that killed about 1,800, mostly in coastal communities. Caribbean countries and the United States have collaborated to create tsunami warning systems and are mapping high-risk low-lying areas.

The country is home to five terrestrial ecoregions: [[Hispaniolan moist forests]], [[Hispaniolan dry forests]], [[Hispaniolan pine forests]], [[Enriquillo wetlands]], and [[Greater Antilles mangroves]].<ref name="DinersteinOlson2017">{{cite journal|last1=Dinerstein|first1=Eric|last2=Olson|first2=David|last3=Joshi|first3=Anup|last4=Vynne|first4=Carly|last5=Burgess|first5=Neil D.|last6=Wikramanayake|first6=Eric|last7=Hahn|first7=Nathan|last8=Palminteri|first8=Suzanne|last9=Hedao|first9=Prashant|last10=Noss|first10=Reed|last11=Hansen|first11=Matt|last12=Locke|first12=Harvey|last13=Ellis|first13=Erle C|last14=Jones|first14=Benjamin|last15=Barber|first15=Charles Victor|last16=Hayes|first16=Randy|last17=Kormos|first17=Cyril|last18=Martin|first18=Vance|last19=Crist|first19=Eileen|last20=Sechrest|first20=Wes|last21=Price|first21=Lori|last22=Baillie|first22=Jonathan E.

=== Military ===
[[File:Two Commando soldiers of the MEFA provide security.jpg|thumb|left|Dominican soldiers training in Santo Domingo]]
{{Main|Military of the Dominican Republic}}
[[Congress of the Dominican Republic|Congress]] authorizes a combined military force of 44,000 active duty personnel. Actual active duty strength is approximately 32,000. Approximately 50% of those are used for non-military activities such as security providers for government-owned non-military facilities, highway toll stations, prisons, forestry work, state enterprises, and private businesses. The commander in chief of the military is the president.

The army is larger than the other services combined with approximately 56,780 active duty personnel, consisting of six infantry [[brigade]]s, a combat support brigade, and a combat service support brigade. The air force operates two main bases, one in the southern region near Santo Domingo and one in the northern region near Puerto Plata. The navy operates two major naval bases, one in Santo Domingo and one in Las Calderas on the southwestern coast, and maintains 12 operational vessels. The Dominican Republic has the largest military in the Caribbean region surpassing Cuba.<ref>[[#IISS2018|IISS 2018]], pp. 402</ref>

The armed forces have organized a Specialized Airport Security Corps (CESA) and a Specialized Port Security Corps (CESEP) to meet international security needs in these areas. The secretary of the armed forces has also announced plans to form a specialized border corps (CESEF). The armed forces provide 75% of personnel to the National Investigations Directorate (DNI) and the Counter-Drug Directorate (DNCD).<ref name="ussdnote" />

The Dominican National Police force contains 32,000 agents. The police are not part of the Dominican armed forces but share some overlapping security functions. Sixty-three percent of the force serve in areas outside traditional police functions, similar to the situation of their military counterparts.<ref name="ussdnote" />

In 2018, Dominican Republic signed the UN [[treaty on the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons]].<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://treaties.un.org/Pages/ViewDetails.aspx?src=TREATY&mtdsg_no=XXVI-9&chapter=26&clang=_en |title=Chapter XXVI: Disarmament&nbsp;– No. 9 Treaty on the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons |publisher=United Nations Treaty Collection |date=7 July 2017}}</ref>

=== Administrative divisions ===
{{Main|Provinces of the Dominican Republic|Municipalities of the Dominican Republic}}
[[File:Dominican Republic, administrative divisions - de - monochrome.svg|thumb|right|300px|Provinces of the Dominican Republic]]
The Dominican Republic is divided into 31 [[Provinces of the Dominican Republic|provinces]]. Santo Domingo, the capital, is designated [[Distrito Nacional]] (National District). The provinces are divided into municipalities (''[[municipio]]s''; singular ''municipio''). They are the second-level political and [[Administrative division|administrative subdivisions]] of the country. The president appoints the governors of the 31 provinces. Mayors and municipal councils administer the 124 municipal districts and the National District (Santo Domingo). They are elected at the same time as congressional representatives.<ref name="ussdnote" />

The provinces are the first–level [[Administrative division|administrative subdivision]]s of the country. The headquarters of the central government's regional offices are normally found in the capital cities of provinces. The president appoints an administrative governor (''Gobernador Civil'') for each province but not for the Distrito Nacional (Title IX of the constitution).<ref name="Constitution">{{cite web |url=https://www.constituteproject.org/constitution/Dominican_Republic_2015.pdf |title=Dominican Republic's Constitution of 2015 |website=constitute.org |access-date=28 December 2020}}</ref>

The Distrito Nacional was created in 1936. Prior to this, the Distrito National was the old Santo Domingo Province, in existence since the country's independence in 1844. It is not to be confused with the new Santo Domingo Province split off from it in 2001. While it is similar to a province in many ways, the Distrito Nacional differs in its lack of an administrative governor and consisting only of one municipality, [[Santo Domingo]], the city council (''[[ayuntamiento]]'') and mayor (''síndico'') which are in charge of its administration.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.informejudicial.com/leyes/Division%20Territorial/Ley%20163-01,%20crea%20Provincia%20Santo%20Domingo%20y%20Modifica%20Articulos%201%20y%202%20Ley%205220.htm|title=Ley No. 163-01 que crea la provincia de Santo Domingo, y modifica los Artículos 1 y 2 de la Ley No. 5220, sobre División Territorial de la República Dominicana.|author=EL CONGRESO NACIONAL|language=es|access-date=2007-03-08 |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20070518042944/http://www.informejudicial.com/leyes/Division+Territorial/Ley+163-01,+crea+Provincia+Santo+Domingo+y+Modifica+Articulos+1+y+2+Ley+5220.htm <!-- Bot retrieved archive --> |archive-date = 2007-05-18}}</ref>

This recession followed the collapse of the second-largest [[commercial bank]] in the country, [[Banco Intercontinental|Baninter]], linked to a major incident of fraud valued at US$3.5 billion. The Baninter fraud had a devastating effect on the Dominican economy, with GDP dropping by 1% in 2003 as inflation ballooned by over 27%.

[[File:Isla Saona - panoramio.jpg|thumb|upright=1.1|[[Saona Island]]]]
The Dominican Republic is the [[world Tourism rankings|most visited destination]] in the Caribbean. The year-round golf courses are major attractions.<ref name="consulate" /> A geographically diverse nation, the Dominican Republic is home to both the Caribbean's tallest mountain peak, [[Pico Duarte]], and the Caribbean's largest lake and point of lowest elevation, [[Lake Enriquillo]].<ref name="Baker 2008 190" /> The island has an average temperature of {{convert|26|°C|°F|1}} and great climatic and biological diversity.<ref name="consulate" /> The country is also the site of the first cathedral, castle, monastery, and fortress built in the Americas, located in Santo Domingo's [[Ciudad Colonial (Santo Domingo)|Colonial Zone]], a [[World Heritage Site]].<ref name="Colonial City of Santo Domingo" /><ref name="unesco.org" />

Tourism is one of the fueling factors in the Dominican Republic's economic growth. The Dominican Republic is the most popular tourist destination in the [[Caribbean]]. With the construction of projects like [[Cap Cana]], San Souci Port in Santo Domingo, [[Casa de Campo, Dominican Republic|Casa De Campo]] and the Hard Rock Hotel & Casino (ancient Moon Palace Resort) in [[Punta Cana]], the Dominican Republic expects increased tourism activity in the upcoming years.

[[Ecotourism]] has also been a topic increasingly important in this nation, with towns like [[Jarabacoa]] and neighboring [[Constanza, Dominican Republic|Constanza]], and locations like the [[Pico Duarte]], [[Bahia de las Aguilas]], and others becoming more significant in efforts to increase direct benefits from tourism. Most residents from other countries [[Visa policy of the Dominican Republic|are required to get a tourist card]], depending on the country they live in. In the last 10 years the Dominican Republic has become one of the worlds notably progressive states in terms of recycling and waste disposal. A UN report cited there was a 221.3% efficiency increase in the previous 10 years due, in part, to the opening of the largest open air landfill site located in the north 10&nbsp;km from the Haitian border.

=== Transportation ===
{{Main|Transportation in the Dominican Republic}}
[[File:27 de febrero av. Santo Domingo.jpg|thumb|right|280px|27 de febrero avenue in [[Santo Domingo]].]]
The country has three national trunk highways, which connect every major town. These are [[DR-1]], [[DR-2]], and [[DR-3]], which depart from Santo Domingo toward the northern (Cibao), southwestern (Sur), and eastern (El Este) parts of the country respectively. These highways have been consistently improved with the expansion and reconstruction of many sections. Two other national highways serve as spur ([[DR-5]]) or alternative routes ([[DR-4]]).

In addition to the national highways, the government has embarked on an expansive reconstruction of spur secondary routes, which connect smaller towns to the trunk routes. In the last few years the government constructed a 106-kilometer toll road that connects Santo Domingo with the country's northeastern peninsula. Travelers may now arrive in the Samaná Peninsula in less than two hours. Other additions are the reconstruction of the DR-28 (Jarabacoa&nbsp;– Constanza) and [[DR-12]] (Constanza&nbsp;– Bonao). Despite these efforts, many secondary routes still remain either unpaved or in need of maintenance. There is currently a nationwide program to pave these and other commonly used routes. Also, the [[Santiago light rail]] system is in planning stages but currently on hold.

=== Bus services ===
There are two main bus transportation services in the Dominican Republic: one controlled by the government, through the Oficina Técnica de Transito Terrestre (OTTT) and the Oficina Metropolitana de Servicios de Autobuses (OMSA), and the other controlled by private business, among them, Federación Nacional de Transporte La Nueva Opción (FENATRANO) and the Confederacion Nacional de Transporte (CONATRA). The government transportation system covers large routes in metropolitan areas such as Santo Domingo and Santiago.

There are many privately owned bus companies, such as Metro Servicios Turísticos and Caribe Tours, that run daily routes.

=== Santo Domingo Metro ===
[[File:Stodgo metro.jpg|thumb|A pair of 9000 series are tested on the Santo Domingo Metro.]]
{{Main|Santo Domingo Metro}}
The Dominican Republic has a [[rapid transit]] system in [[Santo Domingo]], the country's capital. It is the most extensive metro system in the insular [[Caribbean]] and Central American region by length and number of stations. The Santo Domingo Metro is part of a major "National Master Plan" to improve transportation in Santo Domingo as well as the rest of the nation. The first line was planned to relieve traffic congestion in the [[DR-1|Máximo Gómez]] and [[DR-13|Hermanas Mirabal Avenue]]. The second line, which opened in April 2013, is meant to relieve the congestion along the [[DR-13|Duarte-Kennedy-Centenario]] Corridor in the city from west to east. The current length of the Metro, with the sections of the two lines open {{as of|2013|August|lc=y}}, is {{convert|27.35|km|mi}}. Before the opening of the second line, 30,856,515 passengers rode the Santo Domingo Metro in 2012.<ref name="SD-stats">{{cite web|url=http://opret.gob.do/Documentos/Estad%C3%ADsticas%20Institucionales/Estad%C3%ADsticas%20de%20peaje%20y%20tiempo%20de%20recorrido%20al%202013.pdf|title=Estadísticas de peaje y tiempo de recorrido al 2013|trans-title=Statistics of tolls and times of route 2013|language=es|work=opret.gob.do|page=2|date=September 2013|access-date=September 17, 2013}}</ref> With both lines opened, ridership increased to 61,270,054 passengers in 2014.

=== Communications ===
{{Main|Telecommunications in the Dominican Republic}}
The Dominican Republic has a well developed [[Telecommunications in the Dominican Republic|telecommunications]] infrastructure, with extensive mobile phone and [[landline]] services. [[Cable Internet access|Cable Internet]] and [[Digital subscriber line|DSL]] are available in most parts of the country, and many [[Internet service provider]]s offer [[3G]] wireless internet service. The Dominican Republic became the second country in Latin America to have 4G LTE wireless service. The reported speeds are from 1 Mbit/s up to 100 Mbit/s for residential services.

For commercial service there are speeds from 256 kbit/s up to 154 Mbit/s. (Each set of numbers denotes [[Cable Internet access|downstream/upstream speed]]; that is, to the user/from the user.) Projects to extend [[Wi-Fi]] hot spots have been made in Santo Domingo. The country's commercial radio stations and television stations are in the process of transferring to the [[Data transmission|digital spectrum]], via [[HD Radio]] and [[High-definition television|HDTV]] after officially adopting [[Advanced Television Systems Committee standards|ATSC]] as the digital medium in the country with a switch-off of analog transmission by September 2015. The telecommunications regulator in the country is INDOTEL (''Instituto Dominicano de Telecomunicaciones'').

The largest telecommunications company is [[Claro República Dominicana|Claro]]&nbsp;– part of [[Carlos Slim]]'s [[América Móvil]]&nbsp;– which provides wireless, landline, broadband, and [[IPTV]] services. In June 2009 there were more than 8 million phone line subscribers (land and cell users) in the D.R., representing 81% of the country's population and a fivefold increase since the year 2000, when there were 1.6 million. The communications sector generates about 3.0% of the GDP.<ref name="LD2009-06-05" /> There were 2,439,997 Internet users in March 2009.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.indotel.gob.do/component/option,com_docman/task,cat_view/gid,110/Itemid,757 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110226134642/http://www.indotel.gob.do/component/option%2Ccom_docman/task%2Ccat_view/gid%2C110/Itemid%2C757 |archive-date=February 26, 2011 |title=Indicadores Telefonicos 2009 |access-date=June 5, 2009 |work=Indotel |url-status=dead }}</ref>

In November 2009, the Dominican Republic became the first Latin American country to pledge to include a "gender perspective" in every information and communications technology (ICT) initiative and policy developed by the government.<ref>[http://elnuevodiario.com.do/app/article.aspx?id=175919 Indotel garantiza igualdad de género en proyectos tecnológicos realiza en todo el país] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110503184609/http://elnuevodiario.com.do/app/article.aspx?id=175919 |date=May 3, 2011 }}. elnuevodiario.com.do.

=== Electricity ===
{{Main|Electricity sector in the Dominican Republic}}
Electric power service has been unreliable since the Trujillo era, and as much as 75% of the equipment is that old. The country's antiquated power grid causes transmission losses that account for a large share of billed electricity from generators. The privatization of the sector started under a previous administration of Leonel Fernández.<ref name="coha">{{cite web|first=Claudia|last=Patterson|url=http://www.coha.org/2004/10/president-leonel-fernandez-friend-or-foe-of-reform/|title=President Leonel Fernández: Friend or Foe of Reform?|work=Council on Hemispheric Affairs|date=October 4, 2004|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081107015518/http://www.coha.org/2004/10/president-leonel-fernandez-friend-or-foe-of-reform/|archive-date=November 7, 2008}}</ref> The recent investment in a 345 kilovolt "Santo Domingo–Santiago Electrical Highway"<ref name="DT2009-04-29" /> with reduced [[Electric power transmission#Losses|transmission losses]], is being heralded as a major capital improvement to the national grid since the mid-1960s.

During the Trujillo regime electrical service was introduced to many cities. Almost 95% of usage was not billed at all. Around half of the Dominican Republic's 2.1 million houses have no meters and most do not pay or pay a fixed monthly rate for their electric service.<ref name="DT2006-06-01" />

Household and general electrical service is delivered at 110 [[volt]]s alternating at 60&nbsp;[[Hertz|Hz]]. Electrically powered items from the United States work with no modifications. The majority of the Dominican Republic has access to electricity. Tourist areas tend to have more reliable power, as do business, travel, healthcare, and vital infrastructure.<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20120117175316/http://www.cdeee.gov.do/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=791%3Aedesur-agrega-3500-familias-a-24-horas-de-luz&catid=6%3Anoticias&Itemid=2 EDESUR agrega 3,500 familias a 24 Horas de Luz].

The Catholic Church began to lose its strong dominance in the late 19th century. This was due to a lack of funding, priests, and support programs. During the same time, [[Protestant]] [[Evangelicalism]] began to gain a wider support "with their emphasis on personal responsibility and family rejuvenation, economic entrepreneurship, and biblical [[fundamentalism]]".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.encyclopedia.com/philosophy-and-religion/christianity/roman-catholic-orders-and-missions/dominicans|title=Dominicans – Encyclopedia of World Cultures|website=encyclopedia.com|access-date=2019-09-14}}</ref> The Dominican Republic has two Catholic patroness saints: ''Nuestra Señora de la Altagracia'' (Our Lady Of High Grace) and ''Nuestra Señora de las Mercedes'' (Our Lady Of Mercy).

The Dominican Republic has historically granted extensive religious freedom. According to the [[United States Department of State]], "The constitution specifies that there is no state church and provides for freedom of religion and belief. A concordat with the Vatican designates Catholicism as the official religion and extends special privileges to the Catholic Church not granted to other religious groups. These include the legal recognition of church law, use of public funds to underwrite some church expenses, and complete exoneration from customs duties."<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.refworld.org/docid/502105c67d.html|title=Refworld &#124; 2011 Report on International Religious Freedom - Dominican Republic|first=United Nations High Commissioner for|last=Refugees|website=Refworld|access-date=August 4, 2020}}</ref> In the 1950s restrictions were placed upon churches by the government of Trujillo.

During World War II a group of Jews escaping [[Nazi Germany]] fled to the Dominican Republic and founded the city of [[Sosúa]].

They worked on sugarcane plantations and docks and settled mainly in the cities of [[San Pedro de Macorís]] and [[Puerto Plata (city)|Puerto Plata]]. Puerto Rican, and to a lesser extent, Cuban immigrants fled to the Dominican Republic from the mid-1800s until about 1940 due to a poor economy and social unrest in their respective home countries.

Haiti is the neighboring nation to the Dominican Republic and is considerably poorer, less developed and is additionally the least developed country in the western hemisphere. In 2003, 80% of all Haitians were poor (54% living in abject poverty) and 47.1% were illiterate. The country of nine million people also has a fast growing population, but over two-thirds of the labor force lack formal jobs.

Due to the lack of basic amenities and medical facilities in Haiti a large number of Haitian women, often arriving with several health problems, cross the border to Dominican soil.

{{Main|Dominican Americans|Dominican Republic immigration to Puerto Rico}}
The first of three late-20th century emigration waves began in 1961 after the assassination of dictator Trujillo,<ref name="Wilderotter" /> due to fear of retaliation by Trujillo's allies and political uncertainty in general. In 1965, the United States began a military occupation of the Dominican Republic to end a civil war. Upon this, the U.S. eased travel restrictions, making it easier for Dominicans to obtain U.S. visas.<ref>{{cite journal|author1=Morrison, Thomas K.  |author2=Sinkin, Richard|jstor=2546161|title=International Migration in the Dominican Republic|journal=International Migration Review|volume= 16|issue=4, Special Issue: International Migration and Development |date=Winter 1982|pages=819–836|doi=10.2307/2546161}}</ref> From 1966 to 1978, the exodus continued, fueled by high unemployment and political repression.

Preschool education is organized in different cycles and serves the 2–4 age group and the 4–6 age group. Preschool education is not mandatory except for the last year. Basic education is compulsory and serves the population of the 6–14 age group. Secondary education is not compulsory, although it is the duty of the state to offer it for free. It caters to the 14–18 age group and is organized in a common core of four years and three modes of two years of study that are offered in three different options: general or academic, vocational (industrial, agricultural, and services), and artistic.

The higher education system consists of institutes and universities. The institutes offer courses of a higher technical level.

=== Visual arts ===
Dominican art is perhaps most commonly associated with the bright, vibrant colors and images that are sold in every tourist gift shop across the country. However, the country has a long history of [[fine art]] that goes back to the middle of the 1800s when the country became independent and the beginnings of a national art scene emerged.

Historically, the painting of this time were centered around images connected to national independence, historical scenes, portraits but also landscapes and images of still life. Styles of painting ranged between [[neoclassicism]] and [[romanticism]]. Between 1920 and 1940 the art scene was influenced by styles of [[realism (arts)|realism]] and [[impressionism]]. Dominican artists were focused on breaking from previous, academic styles in order to develop more independent and individual styles.

=== Architecture ===
[[File:Church and Convent Regina Angelorum CCSD 07 2018 0762.jpg|thumb|Church and Convent, Colonial Santo Domingo.]]

The architecture in the Dominican Republic represents a complex blend of diverse cultures. The deep influence of the [[Europe]]an colonists is the most evident throughout the country. Characterized by ornate designs and [[baroque architecture|baroque]] structures, the style can best be seen in the capital city of [[Santo Domingo]], which is home to the first cathedral, castle, monastery, and fortress in all of the [[Americas]], located in the city's [[Ciudad Colonial (Santo Domingo)|Colonial Zone]], an area declared as a [[World Heritage Site]] by [[UNESCO]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://whc.unesco.org/en/list/526|title=Colonial City of Santo Domingo|publisher=UNESCO World Heritage Centre}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.unesco.org/nac/geoportal.php?country=DO&language=E|title=Dominican Republic National Commission for UNESCO|work=UNESCO|date=November 14, 1957|access-date=August 24, 2016}}</ref> The designs carry over into the villas and buildings throughout the country. It can also be observed on buildings that contain stucco exteriors, arched doors and windows, and red tiled roofs.

The indigenous peoples of the Dominican Republic have also had a significant influence on the architecture of the country. The [[Taíno]] people relied heavily on the mahogany and guano (dried palm tree leaf) to put together crafts, artwork, furniture, and houses. Utilizing mud, thatched roofs, and mahogany trees, they gave buildings and the furniture inside a natural look, seamlessly blending in with the island's surroundings.

Lately, with the rise in tourism and increasing popularity as a Caribbean vacation destination, architects in the Dominican Republic have now begun to incorporate cutting-edge designs that emphasize luxury. In many ways an architectural playground, villas and hotels implement new styles, while offering new takes on the old. This new style is characterized by simplified, angular corners and large windows that blend outdoor and indoor spaces. As with the culture as a whole, contemporary architects embrace the Dominican Republic's rich history and various cultures to create something new. Surveying modern villas, one can find any combination of the three major styles: a villa may contain angular, modernist building construction, Spanish Colonial-style arched windows, and a traditional Taíno hammock in the bedroom balcony.

{{Main|Cuisine of the Dominican Republic}}
[[File:ChicharronMixto.JPG|thumb|Chicharrón mixto, common dish in the country derived from Andalusia in southern Spain.]]

Dominican cuisine is predominantly [[Spanish cuisine#Spanish regional variation: typical dishes and meal routines|Spanish]], [[Taíno#Food and agriculture|Taíno]], and [[African cuisine|African]]. The typical cuisine is quite similar to what can be found in other Latin American countries.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/travel/visit-dominican-republic/caribbean-culture/|title=Caribbean culture in Dominican Republic|last=Booth|first=Joanna|date=2017-07-05|website=telegraph.co.uk|access-date=2019-09-14}}</ref> One breakfast dish consists of eggs and ''[[Mangú (dish)|mangú]]'' (mashed, boiled plantain). Heartier versions of ''mangú'' are accompanied by deep-fried meat (Dominican salami, typically), cheese, or both. Lunch, generally the largest and most important meal of the day, usually consists of rice, meat, beans, and salad. "La Bandera" (literally "The Flag") is the most popular lunch dish; it consists of meat and red beans on white rice. ''[[Sancocho]]'' is a stew often made with seven varieties of meat.
[[File:Patacones.JPG|thumb|left|upright=0.9|Tostones, a fried plantain dish]]

Meals tend to favor meats and starches over dairy products and vegetables. Many dishes are made with ''[[sofrito]]'', which is a mix of local herbs used as a wet rub for meats and sautéed to bring out all of a dish's flavors. Throughout the south-central coast, [[bulgur]], or whole wheat, is a main ingredient in [[Tabbouleh|''quipes'' or ''tipili'']] (bulgur salad). Other favorite Dominican foods include ''[[chicharrón]]'', ''[[Cassava|yuca]]'', ''[[Tapioca|casabe]]'', ''[[Cuban pastry|pastelitos]]''([[empanada]]s), ''[[Sweet potato|batata]]'', [[Yam (vegetable)|yam]], ''[[Pasteles|pasteles en hoja]]'', ''[[chimichurris]]'', and ''[[tostones]]''.

Some treats Dominicans enjoy are ''[[Rice pudding|arroz con leche]]'' (or ''arroz con dulce''), ''[[Bizcocho Dominicano|bizcocho dominicano]]'' (lit. Dominican cake), ''[[habichuelas con dulce]]'', [[Crème caramel|flan]], ''[[Snow cone|frío frío]]'' (snow cones), [[dulce de leche]], and ''caña'' ([[sugarcane]]). The beverages Dominicans enjoy are ''[[Morir Soñando]]'', [[rum]], beer, ''[[Mama Juana]]'',<ref>[http://www.republicadominicana.net/4-bebidas-tipicas-de-republica-dominicana/ "Bebidas típicas de República Dominicana"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304073748/http://www.republicadominicana.net/4-bebidas-tipicas-de-republica-dominicana/ |date=March 4, 2016 }}. ''RepublicaDominicana.net'' (in Spanish).</ref> ''batida'' (smoothie), jugos naturales (freshly squeezed fruit juices), ''[[Mauby|mabí]]'', coffee, and ''[[chaca (dessert)|chaca]]'' (also called ''maiz caqueao/casqueado'', ''maiz con dulce'' and ''maiz con leche''), the last item being found only in the southern provinces of the country such as San Juan.

=== Music and dance ===
{{Main|Music of the Dominican Republic}}
[[File:Romeo Santos y Juan Luis Guerra.jpg|thumb|[[Merengue music|Merengue]] and [[Bachata (music)|Bachata]] are both music genres native to Dominican Republic, popular and traditional in Latin America. In the image two icons of these genres [[Juan Luis Guerra]] and [[Romeo Santos]]]]

Musically, the Dominican Republic is known for the [[Popular culture|world popular]] [[musical style]] and genre called ''[[Merengue music|merengue]]'',<ref name="Harvey2006"/>{{rp|376–7}} a type of lively, fast-paced rhythm and dance music consisting of a tempo of about 120 to 160 beats per minute (though it varies) based on musical elements like drums, brass, chorded instruments, and accordion, as well as some elements unique to the Spanish-speaking Caribbean, such as the ''[[tambora (Dominican drum)|tambora]]'' and ''[[güira]]''.

Its [[Syncopation|syncopated beats]] use [[Latin percussion]], [[brass instruments]], bass, and piano or keyboard. Between 1937 and 1950 merengue music was promoted internationally by Dominican groups like Billo's Caracas Boys, Chapuseaux and Damiron "Los Reyes del Merengue," Joseito Mateo, and others. Radio, television, and international media popularized it further. Some well known merengue performers are [[Wilfrido Vargas]], [[Johnny Ventura]], singer-songwriter [[Los Hermanos Rosario]], [[Juan Luis Guerra]], [[Fernando Villalona]], [[Eddy Herrera]], [[Sergio Vargas]], [[Toño Rosario]], [[Milly Quezada]], and [[Chichí Peralta]].

Merengue became popular in the United States, mostly on the [[East Coast of the United States|East Coast]], during the 1980s and 1990s,<ref name="Harvey2006"/>{{rp|375}} when many Dominican artists residing in the U.S. (particularly New York) started performing in the Latin club scene and gained radio airplay. They included Victor Roque y La Gran Manzana, Henry Hierro, Zacarias Ferreira, Aventura, and Milly Jocelyn Y Los Vecinos. The emergence of ''[[Bachata (music)|bachata]]'', along with an increase in the number of Dominicans living among other [[Hispanic and Latino Americans|Latino]] groups in New York, [[New Jersey]], and Florida, has contributed to Dominican music's overall growth in popularity.<ref name="Harvey2006"/>{{rp|378}}

[[Bachata (music)|Bachata]], a form of music and dance that originated in the countryside and rural marginal neighborhoods of the Dominican Republic, has become quite popular in recent years. Its subjects are often romantic; especially prevalent are tales of heartbreak and sadness. In fact, the original name for the genre was ''amargue'' ("bitterness," or "bitter music,"), until the rather ambiguous (and mood-neutral) term ''bachata'' became popular. Bachata grew out of, and is still closely related to, the [[Pan-Latinism|pan-Latin]] American romantic style called ''[[bolero]]''. Over time, it has been influenced by merengue and by a variety of Latin American guitar styles.

[[Palo music|Palo]] is an [[Afro-Dominican (Dominican Republic)|Afro-Dominican]] sacred music that can be found throughout the island. The drum and human voice are the principal instruments. Palo is played at religious ceremonies—usually coinciding with saints' religious feast days—as well as for secular parties and special occasions. Its roots are in the [[Congo region]] of central-west Africa, but it is mixed with European influences in the melodies.<ref>[http://www.iasorecords.com/music/palo-drum-afro-dominican-tradition Palo Drum: Afro-Dominican Tradition]. iasorecords.com</ref>

[[Salsa music]] has had a great deal of popularity in the country. During the late 1960s Dominican musicians like [[Johnny Pacheco]], creator of the [[Fania All Stars]], played a significant role in the development and popularization of the genre.

[[Dominican rock]] and [[Reggaeton]] are also popular. Many, if not the majority, of its performers are based in Santo Domingo and Santiago.

=== Fashion ===

Noted fashion designer [[Oscar de la Renta]] was born in the Dominican Republic in 1932, and became a US citizen in 1971. He studied under the leading Spaniard designer [[Cristóbal Balenciaga]] and then worked with the house of [[Lanvin (clothing)|Lanvin]] in Paris. By 1963, he had designs bearing his own label.

=== National symbols ===
[[File:Pereskia quisqueyana.JPG|thumb|upright=0.7|Bayahibe Rose]]

Some of the Dominican Republic's important symbols are the [[Flag of the Dominican Republic|flag]], [[Coat of arms of the Dominican Republic|the coat of arms]], and the national anthem, titled ''[[National Anthem of the Dominican Republic|Himno Nacional]]''. The flag has a large white cross that divides it into four quarters. Two quarters are red and two are blue. Red represents the blood shed by the liberators. Blue expresses God's protection over the nation. The white cross symbolizes the struggle of the liberators to bequeath future generations a free nation. An alternative interpretation is that blue represents the ideals of progress and liberty, whereas white symbolizes peace and unity among Dominicans.<ref>
{{cite web |url=http://www.ejercito.mil.do/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=165&Itemid=132 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090113181033/http://www.ejercito.mil.do/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=165&Itemid=132 |archive-date=January 13, 2009 |title=Ejército Nacional de la República Dominicana&nbsp;– Bandera Nacional |access-date=October 20, 2008 |publisher=National Army of the Dominican Republic |language=es}}</ref>

In the center of the cross is the Dominican coat of arms, in the same colors as the national flag. The coat of arms pictures a red, white, and blue flag-draped shield with a Bible, a gold cross, and arrows; the shield is surrounded by an olive branch (on the left) and a palm branch (on the right). The Bible traditionally represents the truth and the light. The gold cross symbolizes the redemption from slavery, and the arrows symbolize the noble soldiers and their proud military.  A blue ribbon above the shield reads, "Dios, Patria, Libertad" (meaning "God, Fatherland, Liberty"). A red ribbon under the shield reads, "República Dominicana" (meaning "Dominican Republic"). Out of all the flags in the world, the depiction of a Bible is unique to the Dominican flag.

The [[Floral emblem|national flower]] is the [[Pereskia quisqueyana|Bayahibe Rose]] and the [[national tree]] is the [[Swietenia mahagoni|West Indian Mahogany]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.listindiario.com/la-vida/2011/7/16/196080/La-rosa-de-Bayahibe-nuestra-flor-nacional |title=La rosa de Bayahíbe, nuestra flor nacional|author=López, Yaniris |work=Listin Diario |date=July 17, 2011}}</ref> The national bird is the ''Cigua Palmera'' or [[Palmchat]] ("Dulus dominicus").<ref name=depaul>{{cite web|url=http://www.diariodigital.com.do/articulo,30016,html |title=El jardín Botánico Nacional |trans-title=The National Botanical Garden |language=es |last=Pérez |first=Faustino |work=DiarioDigitalRD.com |access-date=October 20, 2008 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081023033403/http://www.diariodigital.com.do/articulo%2C30016%2Chtml |archive-date=October 23, 2008 }}</ref>

However, competing claims and settlements by the French led to the western portion of the island being [[Peace of Ryswick|ceded to France]] in 1697, which was subsequently named ''Saint-Domingue''. French colonists established lucrative [[sugarcane]] [[Sugar plantations in the Caribbean|plantations]], worked by vast numbers of slaves brought from Africa, which made the colony one of the richest in the world.

In the midst of the [[French Revolution]] (1789–99), slaves and [[free people of color]] launched the [[Haitian Revolution]] (1791–1804), led by a former slave and the first black general of the [[French Army]], [[Toussaint Louverture]]. After 12 years of conflict, [[Napoleon]] Bonaparte's forces were defeated by Louverture's successor, [[Jean-Jacques Dessalines]] (later Emperor Jacques I), who declared Haiti's sovereignty on 1 January 1804—the first independent [[Nation state|nation]] of [[Latin America]] and the [[Caribbean]], the second [[republic]] in the Americas, the first country to abolish slavery, and the only state in history established by a successful [[Slave rebellion|slave revolt]].<ref>{{cite book|title=Anacaona, Golden Flower|author=Danticat, Edwidge|journal=Journal of Haitian Studies|publisher=Scholastic Inc.|year=2005|isbn=978-0-439-49906-4|volume=11|location=New York|pages=163–165|jstor=41715319|author-link=Edwidge Danticat|issue=2}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|author=Matthewson, Tim|year=1996|title=Jefferson and the Nonrecognition of Haiti|journal=Proceedings of the American Philosophical Society|volume=140|issue=1|pages=22–48|issn=0003-049X|jstor=987274}}</ref> Apart from [[Alexandre Pétion]], the first President of the Republic, all of Haiti's first leaders were former slaves.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/americas/country_profiles/1202772.stm |title=Country profile: Haiti |date=19 January 2010 |work=BBC News |access-date=23 January 2010}}</ref> After a brief period in which the country was split in two, President [[Jean-Pierre Boyer]] united the country and then attempted to bring the whole of Hispaniola under Haitian control, precipitating a long series of wars that ended in the 1870s when Haiti formally recognized the independence of the Dominican Republic. Haiti's first century of independence was characterized by political instability, ostracism by the international community and the payment of a crippling debt to France. Political volatility and foreign economic influence in the country prompted the U.S. to occupy the country from 1915 to 1934. Following a series of short-lived presidencies, [[François Duvalier|François 'Papa Doc' Duvalier]] took power in 1956, ushering in a long period of autocratic rule that was continued by his son [[Jean-Claude Duvalier|Jean-Claude 'Baby Doc' Duvalier]] that lasted until 1986; the period was characterized by state-sanctioned violence against the opposition and civilians, corruption, and economic stagnation. Since 1986 Haiti has been attempting to establish a more democratic political system.

Haiti is a founding member of the [[United Nations]], [[Organization of American States]] (OAS),<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.oas.org/en/member_states/member_state.asp?sCode=HAI|title= OAS – Member State: Haiti|publisher=OAS – Organization of American States: Democracy for peace, security, and development|last=OAS|date=1 August 2009|website=www.oas.org}}</ref> [[Association of Caribbean States]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.acs-aec.org/sites/default/files/english_ebook_acs_20_low_res.pdf |title=Association of Caribbean States (1994–2014) |editor=Press |page=46 |year=2014 |access-date=25 April 2016}}</ref> and the [[Organisation internationale de la Francophonie|International Francophonie Organisation]].

Historically poor and politically unstable, Haiti has the lowest [[List of countries by Human Development Index|Human Development Index]] in the Americas. Since the turn of the 21st century, the country has endured a ''[[2004 Haitian coup d'état|coup d'état]],'' which prompted a [[United Nations Stabilisation Mission in Haiti|U.N. intervention]], as well as [[2010 Haiti earthquake|a deadly earthquake]] that killed over 250,000.

In Taíno society the largest unit of political organization was led by a ''[[cacique]],'' or chief, as the Europeans understood them.

As the Spanish re-focused their colonization efforts on the greater riches of mainland Central and South America, Hispaniola became reduced largely to a trading and refueling post.

Inspired by the [[French Revolution]] of 1789 and principles of the [[rights of man]], the French settlers and free people of color pressed for greater political freedom and more [[civil rights]].<ref name="Bradt12"/> Tensions between these two groups led to conflict, as a militia of free-coloreds was set up in 1790 by [[Vincent Ogé]], resulting in his capture, torture and execution.<ref name="Encylopedia Britannica - Haiti"/> Sensing an opportunity, in August 1791 the first slave armies were established in northern Haiti under the leadership of [[Toussaint Louverture]] inspired by the Vodou ''houngan'' (priest) Boukman, and backed by the Spanish in Santo Domingo – soon a full-blown slave rebellion had broken out across the entire colony.<ref name="Encylopedia Britannica - Haiti"/>

In 1792, the [[French First Republic|French]] government sent three commissioners with troops to re-establish control; to build an alliance with the ''[[gens de couleur]]'' and slaves commissioners [[Léger-Félicité Sonthonax]] and [[Étienne Polverel]] abolished slavery in the colony.<ref name="Bradt12"/> Six months later, the [[National Convention]], led by [[Maximilien de Robespierre]] and the [[Jacobin Club|Jacobins]], endorsed [[abolition of slavery timeline|abolition]] and extended it to all the French colonies.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://chnm.gmu.edu/revolution/d/291/ |title=Decree of the National Convention of 4 February 1794, Abolishing Slavery in all the Colonies |publisher=Chnm.gmu.edu |access-date=24 July 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110603234817/http://chnm.gmu.edu/revolution/d/291/ |archive-date=3 June 2011 |url-status=dead }}</ref>

After losing the support of Haiti's elite, Boyer was ousted in 1843, with [[Charles Rivière-Hérard]] replacing him as president.<ref name="Encylopedia Britannica - Haiti"/> Nationalist Dominican forces in eastern Hispaniola led by [[Juan Pablo Duarte]] seized control of Santo Domingo on 27 February 1844.<ref name="Encylopedia Britannica - Haiti"/> The Haitian forces, unprepared for a significant uprising, capitulated to the rebels, effectively ending Haitian rule of eastern Hispaniola.

Guerrier died in April 1845, and was succeeded by General [[Jean-Louis Pierrot]].<ref name="leger197">{{cite book|last=Léger|first=Jacques Nicolas|title=Haiti: Her History and Her Detractors|year=1907|publisher=The Neale Publishing Company|url=http://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Haiti:_Her_History_and_Her_Detractors|pages=197–98}} {{PD-notice}}</ref> Pierrot's most pressing duty as the new president was to check the incursions of the Dominicans, who were harassing the Haitian troops.<ref name="leger197"/> Dominican gunboats were also making depredations on Haiti's coasts.<ref name="leger197" />  President Pierrot decided to open a campaign against the Dominicans, whom he considered merely as insurgents, however the Haitian offensive of 1845 was stopped on the frontier.<ref name="Bethell">{{cite book|last1=Bethell|first1=Leslie|title=The Cambridge History of Latin America: Volume 3|url=https://archive.org/details/cambridgehistory0000beth|url-access=registration|date=1984|publisher=Cambridge University Press|pages=[https://archive.org/details/cambridgehistory0000beth/page/267 267–69]}}</ref>

On 1 January 1846 Pierrot announced a fresh campaign to re-imposed Haitian suzerainty over eastern Hispaniola, but his officers and men greeted this fresh summons with contempt.<ref name="Bethell" /> Thus, a month later – February 1846 – when Pierrot ordered his troops to march against the Dominicans, the Haitian army mutinied, and its soldiers proclaimed his overthrow as president of the republic.<ref name="Bethell" /> With the war against the Dominicans having become very unpopular in Haiti, it was beyond the power of the new president, General [[Jean-Baptiste Riché]], to stage another invasion.<ref name="Bethell" />

====Second Empire (1849–1859)====
{{main|Second Empire of Haiti}}
[[File:Faustin I.jpg|thumb|Faustin I, from ''[[The Illustrated London News]]'', 16 February 1856]]
On 27 February 1847, President Riché died after only a year in power and was replaced by an obscure officer, General [[Faustin Soulouque]].<ref name="Encylopedia Britannica - Haiti"/> During the first two years of Soulouque's administration the conspiracies and opposition he faced in retaining power were so manifold that the Dominicans were given a further breathing space in which to consolidate their independence.<ref name="Bethell" /> But, when in 1848 France finally recognized the Dominican Republic as a free and independent state and provisionally signed a treaty of peace, friendship, commerce and navigation, Haiti immediately protested, claiming the treaty was an attack upon their own security.<ref name="Bethell" /> Soulouque decided to invade the new Republic before the French Government could ratify the treaty.<ref name="Bethell" />

On 21 March 1849, Haitian soldiers attacked the Dominican garrison at [[Las Matas de Farfán|Las Matas]]. The demoralized defenders offered almost no resistance before abandoning their weapons. Soulouque pressed on, capturing [[San Juan Province (Dominican Republic)|San Juan]]. This left only the town of [[Azua, Dominican Republic|Azua]] as the remaining Dominican stronghold between the Haitian army and the capital. On 6 April, Azua fell to the 18,000-strong Haitian army, with a 5,000-man Dominican counterattack failing to oust them.<ref name="Latin America's Wars: Volume 1"/> The way to [[Santo Domingo]] was now clear. But the news of discontent existing at Port-au-Prince, which reached Soulouque, arrested his further progress and caused him to return with the army to his capital.<ref name="Jacques">{{cite book|last=Léger|first=Jacques Nicolas|title=Haiti: Her History and Her Detractors|year=1907|publisher=The Neale Publishing Company|url=http://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Haiti:_Her_History_and_Her_Detractors|pages=202–04}} {{PD-notice}}</ref>

Emboldened by the sudden retreat of the Haitian army, the Dominicans counter-attacked. Their flotilla went as far as [[Dame-Marie, Grand'Anse|Dame-Marie]], which they plundered and set on fire.<ref name="Jacques" /> Soulouque, now self-proclaimed as Emperor Faustin I, decided to start a new campaign against them. In 1855, he again invaded the territory of the Dominican Republic. But owing to insufficient preparation, the army was soon in want of victuals and ammunition.<ref name="Jacques" /> In spite of the bravery of the soldiers, the Emperor had once more to give up the idea of a unified island under Haitian control.<ref name="Jacques" /> After this campaign, Britain and France interfered and obtained an armistice on behalf of the Dominicans, who declared independence as the Dominican Republic.<ref name="Jacques" />

The sufferings endured by the soldiers during the campaign of 1855, and the losses and sacrifices inflicted on the country without yielding any compensation or any practical results provoked great discontent.<ref name="Jacques" /> In 1858 a revolution began, led by General [[Fabre Geffrard]], Duke of Tabara. In December of that year, Geffrard defeated the Imperial Army and seized control of most of the country.<ref name="Encylopedia Britannica - Haiti"/> As a result, the Emperor abdicated his throne on 15 January 1859. Refused aid by the French Legation, Faustin was taken into exile aboard a British warship on 22 January 1859, and General Geffrard succeeded him as President.

Within weeks, a new pro-U.S. Haitian president, [[Philippe Sudré Dartiguenave]], was installed and a new constitution written that was favorable to the interests of the United States. The constitution (written by future US President [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]]) included a clause that allowed, for the first time, foreign ownership of land in Haiti, which was bitterly opposed by the Haitian legislature and citizenry.<ref name="Bradt15"/><ref>{{cite book |author=Hans Schmidt |title=The United States Occupation of Haiti, 1915–1934 |publisher=[[Rutgers University Press]] |year=1971 |isbn=9780813522036 |page=99 }}</ref>

Haiti forms the western three-eighths of [[Hispaniola]], the second largest island in the [[Greater Antilles]]. At 27,750 sq km Haiti is the third largest country in the Caribbean behind [[Cuba]] and the [[Dominican Republic]], the latter sharing a {{convert|360|km|mi|0|adj=on}} [[Dominican Republic–Haiti border|border]] with Haiti. The country has a roughly horseshoe shape and because of this it has a disproportionately long coastline, second in length ({{convert|1771|km|mi|0|abbr=on|disp=or}}) behind Cuba in the Greater Antilles.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.loc.gov/today/placesinthenews/archive/2010arch/20100114_haiti.html |title=Geography: Haiti |access-date=29 September 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.worldatlas.com/webimage/countrys/namerica/caribb/haiti/htland.htm |title=Geography: Haiti| access-date=29 September 2014}}</ref>

Haiti is the most mountainous nation in the Caribbean, its terrain consists of mountains interspersed with small coastal plains and river valleys.<ref name="CIA World Factbook – Haiti"/> The climate is tropical, with some variation depending on altitude. The highest point is [[Pic la Selle]], at {{convert|2680|m|ft|0|}}.<ref name="NgCheong-Lum, Roseline 19" /><ref name="CIA World Factbook – Haiti"/><ref name="Encylopedia Britannica - Haiti"/>

The northern region consists of the ''[[Massif du Nord]]'' (Northern Massif) and the ''[[Plaine du Nord]]'' (Northern Plain). The ''Massif du Nord'' is an extension of the ''Cordillera Central'' in the Dominican Republic.<ref name="Encylopedia Britannica - Haiti"/> It begins at Haiti's eastern border, north of the [[Guayamouc River]], and extends to the northwest through the northern peninsula. The lowlands of the ''Plaine du Nord'' lie along the northern border with the Dominican Republic, between the ''Massif du Nord'' and the North Atlantic Ocean.

The central region consists of two plains and two sets of mountain ranges. The ''Plateau Central'' (Central Plateau) extends along both sides of the Guayamouc River, south of the ''Massif du Nord''. It runs from the southeast to the northwest. To the southwest of the ''Plateau Central'' are the ''[[Montagnes Noires, Haiti|Montagnes Noires]]'', whose most northwestern part merges with the ''Massif du Nord''. Haiti's most important valley in terms of crops is the Plaine de l'Artibonite, which lies between the Montagnes Noires and the [[Chaîne des Matheux]].<ref name="Encylopedia Britannica - Haiti"/> This region supports the country's (also Hispaniola's) longest river, the [[Artibonite River|Riviere l'Artibonite]], which begins in the western region of the Dominican Republic and continues for most of its length through central Haiti, where it then empties into the [[Gulf of Gonâve|Golfe de la Gonâve]].<ref name="Encylopedia Britannica - Haiti"/> Also in this valley lies Haiti's second largest lake, [[Lac de Péligre]], formed as a result of the construction of the [[Péligre Dam]] in the mid-1950s.<ref name=Wells>Jennifer Wells, [https://www.thestar.com/news/world/2010/11/21/a_dam_for_the_people_and_a_people_damned.html "A dam for the people, and A people damned"], ‘’Toronto Star’’, 21 November 2010</ref>

[[File:Aerial 2.jpeg|thumb|right|Saint-Marc Arrondissement, [[Artibonite (department)|Artibonite Deparment]]]]
The southern region consists of the ''[[Plaine du Cul-de-Sac]]'' (the southeast) and the mountainous southern peninsula (also known as the [[Tiburon Peninsula, Haiti|Tiburon Peninsula]]). The Plaine du Cul-de-Sac is a natural depression that harbors the country's saline lakes, such as [[Trou Caïman]] and Haiti's largest lake, [[Étang Saumatre]]. The [[Chaîne de la Selle]] mountain range – an extension of the southern mountain chain of the Dominican Republic (the Sierra de Baoruco) – extends from the Massif de la Selle in the east to the [[Massif de la Hotte]] in the west.<ref name="Encylopedia Britannica - Haiti"/>

Haiti also includes several offshore islands. The island of [[Tortuga (Haiti)|Tortuga]] (Île de la Tortue) is located off the coast of northern Haiti. The [[Arrondissements of Haiti|arrondissement]] of [[Gonâve Island|La Gonâve]] is located on the island of the same name, in the [[Gulf of Gonâve|Golfe de la Gonâve]]; Haiti's largest island, Gonâve is moderately populated by rural villagers.

==Government and politics==
{{Main|Politics of Haiti}}
[[File:Jovenel Moise.jpg|thumb|right|150px|[[Jovenel Moïse]] is the current President of Haiti]]

Legislative power is vested in both the government and the two chambers of the [[National Assembly of Haiti]], the [[Senate (Haiti)|Senate]] (Sénat) and the [[Chamber of Deputies (Haiti)|Chamber of Deputies]] (Chambre des Députés).<ref name="Encylopedia Britannica - Haiti"/><ref name="CIA World Factbook – Haiti"/> The government is organized [[unitary state|unitarily]], thus the central government ''delegates'' powers to the departments without a constitutional need for consent. The current structure of Haiti's political system was set forth in the [[Constitution of Haiti]] on 29 March 1987.<ref name="CIA World Factbook – Haiti"/>

Haitian politics have been contentious: since independence, Haiti has suffered 32 [[List of revolutions and coups d'état in Haiti|coups]].<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=1741707&ps=rs |title=Haiti Starts Over, Once Again |author=Michele Kelemen |publisher=Npr.org |date=2 March 2004 |access-date=24 July 2013}}</ref> Haiti is the only country in the Western Hemisphere to undergo a successful [[Haitian Revolution|slave revolution]]; however, a long history of oppression by dictators such as [[François Duvalier]] and his son [[Jean-Claude Duvalier]] has markedly affected the nation.

=== Administrative divisions ===
{{Main|Administrative divisions of Haiti}}

Administratively, Haiti is divided into ten [[Departments of Haiti|departments]].<ref name="CIA World Factbook – Haiti"/> The departments are listed below, with the departmental capital cities in parentheses.

Conversely, according to the 2013 [[United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime]] ([[UNODC]]) report, murder rates in Haiti (10.2 per 100,000) are far ''below'' the regional average (26 per 100,000); less than {{sfrac|1|4}} that of Jamaica (39.3 per 100,000) and nearly {{sfrac|1|2}} that of the Dominican Republic (22.1 per 100,000), making it among the safer countries in the region.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.unodc.org/unodc/en/press/releases/2014/April/some-437000-people-murdered-worldwide-in-2012-according-to-new-unodc-study.html |title=Some 437,000 people murdered worldwide in 2012, according to new UNODC study |access-date=12 April 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.unodc.org/documents/gsh/pdfs/2014_GLOBAL_HOMICIDE_BOOK_web.pdf |title=Global Study on Homicide |year=2013 |publisher=UNODC |access-date=20 April 2015}}</ref> In large part, this is due to the country's ability to fulfil a pledge by increasing its national police yearly by 50%, a four-year initiative that was started in 2012.

In 2010, the [[New York City Police Department]] (NYPD) sent a team of veteran officers to Haiti to assist in the rebuilding of its police force with special training in investigative techniques, strategies to improve the anti-kidnapping personnel and community outreach to build stronger relationships with the public especially among the youth.

In 2012 and 2013, 150 HNP officers received specialized training funded by the US government, which also contributed to the infrastructure and communications support by upgrading radio capacity and constructing new police stations from the most violent-prone neighborhoods of [[Cité Soleil]] and [[Grande Ravine]] in Port-au-Prince to the new northern industrial park at [[Caracol, Nord-Est|Caracol]].<ref name="USAID" />

=== Haitian penitentiary system ===
[[Port-au-Prince]] [[Prison|penitentiary]] is home to half of Haiti's prisoners. The prison has a capacity of 1,200 [[Detention (imprisonment)|detainees]] but {{as of|2017|November|lc=y}} the penitentiary was obliged to keep 4,359 detainees, a 454% occupancy level.<ref name="auto">{{Cite news |url=https://apnews.com/a43ce17acfd0425cb2af90a1133a8418 |title=Malnutrition killing inmates in Haiti jails |work=apnews.com |first=David |last=McFadden |date=20 February 2017 |access-date=2 January 2020}}</ref> This leads to severe consequences for the inmates.

One cell could hold up to 60 inmates which was originally designed for only 18, therefore creating tight and uncomfortable living conditions. The inmates are forced to create makeshift [[hammock]]s from the wall and ceilings. The men are on a 22/ 23 hour lock up in the cells so the risk of diseases is very high.<ref name="auto" /> Unable to receive sufficient funds from the government as Haiti endures severe natural disasters which takes up their attention and resources, such as the 2010 earthquake, has caused deadly cases of [[malnutrition]], combined with the tight living conditions, increases the risk of infectious diseases such as [[tuberculosis]] which has led to 21 deaths in January 2017 alone at the Port-au-Prince penitentiary.<ref name="auto" />

Haitian law states that once arrested, one must go before a judge within 48 hours; however, this is very rare. In an interview with [[Unreported World]], the prison governor stated that around 529 detainees were never sentenced, there are 3,830 detainees who are in prolonged detained trial detention. Therefore, 80% are not convicted.<ref>{{Citation|last=Unreported World|title=Haiti's prison from hell {{!}} Unreported World|date=30 November 2017|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SwE_uUgomd0|access-date=30 March 2018}}</ref>

Unless families are able to provide the necessary funds for inmates to appear before a judge there is a very slim chance the inmate would have a trial, on average, within 10 years. [[Brian Concannon]], the director of the non-profit Institute for Justice and Democracy in Haiti, claims that without a substantial bribe to persuade judges, prosecutors and lawyers to undergo their case, there is no prospect for getting a trial for years.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.foxnews.com/world/2017/02/20/living-hell-officials-alarmed-by-upsurge-inmates-dying-in-haiti-prisons.html|title=Living hell: Officials alarmed by upsurge of inmates dying in Haiti prisons|date=20 February 2017|work=Fox News|access-date=30 March 2018|language=en-US}}</ref>

Families may send food to the penitentiary; however, most inmates depend on the meals served twice a day. However, the majority of the meals consists of ration supplies of rice, oats or cornmeal, which has led to deadly cases of malnutrition-related ailments such as [[Thiamine deficiency|beriberi]] and [[Anemia|anaemia]].

===Energy===
{{Main|Electricity sector in Haiti}}
In 1925, the city of [[Jacmel]] was the first area in the Caribbean to have electricity and was subsequently dubbed the ''City of Light''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://m.theglobeandmail.com/news/world/lighting-the-way-forward-in-haiti/article1319729/?service=mobile |title=Lighting the way forward in Haiti |author=Leeder, Jessica |work=The Globe and Mail |year=2012 }}</ref>

Today, Haiti relies heavily on an oil alliance with [[Petrocaribe]] for much of its energy requirements. In recent years, hydroelectric, solar and wind energy have been explored as possible sustainable energy sources.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.clintonfoundation.org/our-work/clinton-foundation-haiti/programs/powering-haiti-clean-energy |title=Powering Haiti with Clean Energy}}</ref>
[[File:Power plant in Port-au-Prince.JPEG|thumb|Power plant in Port-au-Prince]]
As of 2017, among all the countries in the Americas, Haiti is producing the least amount of energy. Less than a quarter of the country has electric coverage.<ref>{{Cite journal|date=May 2017|title=The Haiti Sustainable Energy Programme|url=https://postconflict.unep.ch/publications/UNEP_Haiti_sustainable_energy.pdf|journal=UNEP}}</ref> Most regions of Haiti that do have energy are powered by generators. These generators are often expensive and produce a lot of pollution. The areas that do get electricity experience power cuts on a daily basis, and some areas are limited to 12 hours of electricity a day. Electricity is provided by a small number of independent companies: Sogener, E-power, and Haytrac.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Pauyo|first=Jean|date=March 2017|title=Transmitting and Distributing Electricity in Haiti|url=https://www.copenhagenconsensus.com/sites/default/files/electricity_grid_pauyo_english.pdf|journal=Copenhagen Consensus Center}}</ref> There is no national electricity grid within the country.<ref name=":02">Matthew Lucky, Katie Auth, Alexander Ochs, et al., Haiti Sustainable Energy Roadmap: Harnessing Domestic Energy Resources to Build an Affordable, Reliable, and Climate-Compatible Electricity System (Washington, DC: Worldwatch Institute, 2014).</ref> The most common source of energy used is wood, along with charcoal.

On 31 October 2018, Evenson Calixte, the General Director of energy regulation (ANARSE) announced the 24 hour electricity project. To meet this objective, 236 Megawatt needs to installed in Port-au-Prince alone, with an additional 75 Megawatt needed in all other regions in the country. Presently only 27,5% of the population has access to electricity; moreover, the national energy agency l'Électricité d'Haïti (Ed'H) is only able to meet 62% of overall electricity demand said Fritz Caillot, the Minister of Public Works, Transportation and Communication (Travaux publics, transport et communication (TPTC)).<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.vantbefinfo.com/energie-le-projet-delectrification-24-24-presente-aux-citoyens-haitiens/|title=Vant Bèf Info Énergie : le projet d'électrification 24/24 présenté aux Citoyens haïtiens -|date=31 October 2018|work=Vant Bèf Info|access-date=4 November 2018|language=fr-FR|archive-date=5 November 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181105012118/https://www.vantbefinfo.com/energie-le-projet-delectrification-24-24-presente-aux-citoyens-haitiens/|url-status=dead}}</ref>

The middle and upper classes live in suburbs, or in the central part of the bigger cities in apartments, where there is urban planning. Many of the houses they live in are like miniature fortresses, located behind walls embedded with metal spikes, barbed wire, broken glass, and sometimes all three. The gates to these houses are barred at night, the house is locked; guard dogs patrol the yard. These houses are often self-sufficient as well. The houses have backup generators, because the electrical grid in Haiti is unreliable. Some even have rooftop reservoirs for water, as the water supply is also unreliable.<ref name="c151222" />

==Infrastructure==

===Transportation===
{{Main|Transport in Haiti}}
[[File:Haiti rail map 1925.jpg|upright=1.3|thumb|Rail map as of 1925]]

Haiti has two main highways that run from one end of the country to the other. The northern highway, Route Nationale No. 1 (National Highway One), originates in Port-au-Prince, winding through the coastal towns of [[Montrouis]] and [[Gonaïves]], before reaching its terminus at the northern port [[Cap-Haïtien]]. The southern highway, Route Nationale No. 2, links Port-au-Prince with [[Les Cayes]] via [[Léogâne]] and [[Petit-Goâve]]. The state of Haiti's roads are generally poor, many being potholed and becoming impassable in rough weather.<ref name="Encylopedia Britannica - Haiti"/>

According to the Washington Post, "Officials from the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers said Saturday [23 January 2010] that they assessed the damage from the [12 January] quake in Port-au-Prince, Haiti, and found that many of the roads aren't any worse than they were before because they've always been in poor condition."<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2010/01/23/AR2010012302113.html |title=Haiti's Bad Roads not Damaged by Quake, Army Engineers Say |author=Hedgpeth, Dana |work=The Washington Post |date=23 January 2010 |access-date=24 July 2013}}</ref>

The port at Port-au-Prince, [[Port international de Port-au-Prince]],  has more registered shipping than any of the other dozen ports in the country. The port's facilities include [[Crane (machine)|cranes]], large [[Berth (moorings)|berths]], and [[warehouse]]s, but these facilities are not in good condition. The port is underused, possibly due to the substantially high port fees. The port of [[Saint-Marc]] is currently the preferred port of entry for consumer goods coming into Haiti. Reasons for this may include its location away from volatile and [[Traffic congestion|congested]] Port-au-Prince, as well as its central location relative to numerous Haitian cities.

In the past, Haiti used rail transport, however the rail infrastructure was poorly maintained when in use and cost of rehabilitation is beyond the means of the Haitian economy. In 2018 the Regional Development Council of the Dominican Republic proposed a "trans-Hispaniola" railway between both countries.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.dreamintv.com/single-post/2018/02/20/CRD-Wants-to-Build-Railway-that-Runs-Through-Haiti|title=CRD Wants to Build Railway that Runs Through Haiti|website=www.dreamintv.com|date=20 February 2018|access-date=17 November 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191117222328/https://www.dreamintv.com/single-post/2018/02/20/CRD-Wants-to-Build-Railway-that-Runs-Through-Haiti|archive-date=17 November 2019|url-status=dead}}</ref>

===Airports===
[[File:Toussaint Louverture International Airport.jpg|thumb|Toussaint L'Ouverture International Airport]]
{{Main|List of airports in Haiti}}

[[Toussaint Louverture International Airport]], located {{convert|10|km}} North/North East of Port-au-Prince proper in the commune of [[Tabarre]], is the primary transportation hub regarding entry and exit into the country. It has Haiti's main [[jetway]], and along with [[Cap-Haïtien International Airport]] located near the northern city of Cap-Haïtien, handles the vast majority of the country's international flights. Cities such as Jacmel, Jérémie, Les Cayes, and Port-de-Paix have smaller, less accessible airports that are serviced by [[regional airlines]] and private aircraft. Such companies include: [[Caribintair]]  (defunct), [[Sunrise Airways]] and [[Tortug' Air]] (defunct).

In 2013, plans for the development of an international airport on Île-à-Vache were introduced by the Prime Minister.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.haitilibre.com/en/news-9270-haiti-tourism-official-launch-of-project-tourist-destination-ile-a-vache.html|title=Haiti – Tourism : Official launch of project "Tourist destination Ile-à-Vache" – HaitiLibre.com : Haiti news 7/7|work=HaitiLibre.com}}</ref>

===Bus service===
[[File:Tap tap public transportation Haiti.jpg|thumb|A "Tap tap" bus in [[Port-Salut]] ]]

[[Tap tap]] buses are colorfully painted buses or pick-up trucks that serve as share taxis. The "tap tap" name comes from the sound of passengers tapping on the metal bus body to indicate they want off.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.jansochor.com/photo-blog.aspx?id=tap-tap-haiti |title=Tap-Tap |access-date=29 January 2014}}</ref> These vehicles for hire are often privately owned and extensively decorated. They follow fixed routes, do not leave until filled with passengers, and riders can usually disembark at any point. The decorations are a typically Haitian form of art.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.unv.org/en/news-resources/news/doc/un-volunteer-takes-part.html |title=UN Volunteer takes part in art exhibition in Germany |access-date=29 January 2014 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140202105103/http://www.unv.org/en/news-resources/news/doc/un-volunteer-takes-part.html |archive-date=2 February 2014  }}</ref>

In August 2013, the first coach bus prototype was made in Haiti.<ref name="http">{{cite web|url=http://www.haitilibre.com/en/news-9284-haiti-economy-presentation-of-the-first-bus-prototype-made-in-haiti.html |title=Haiti – Economy : Presentation of the first Bus prototype Made in Haiti |access-date=29 January 2014}}</ref>

===Communications===
{{Main|Telecommunications in Haiti|Television in Haiti}}

In Haiti, communications include the radio, television, fixed and mobile telephones, and the Internet. Haiti ranked last among North American countries in the World Economic Forum's Network Readiness Index (NRI){{snd}} an indicator for determining the development level of a country's information and communication technologies. Haiti ranked number 143 out of 148 overall in the 2014 NRI ranking, down from 141 in 2013.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www3.weforum.org/docs/GITR/2014/GITR_OverallRanking_2014.pdf | title=NRI Overall Ranking 2014 | publisher=World Economic Forum | access-date=28 June 2014}}</ref>

=== Water supply and sanitation ===
{{Main|Water supply and sanitation in Haiti}}

Haiti faces key challenges in the [[water supply]] and [[sanitation]]
sector:
Notably, access to public services is very low, their quality is inadequate and public institutions remain very weak despite foreign aid and the government's declared intent to strengthen the sector's institutions. Foreign and Haitian [[NGO]]s play an important role in the sector, especially in rural and urban slum areas.

===Racial discrimination===

Under colonial rule, [[Mulatto|Haitian mulattoes]] were generally privileged above the black majority, though they possessed fewer rights than the white population. Following the country's independence, they became the nation's social elite. Numerous leaders throughout Haiti's history have been mulattoes. During this time, the slaves and the [[affranchi]]s were given limited opportunities toward education, income, and occupations, but even after gaining independence, the social structure remains a legacy today as the disparity between the upper and lower classes have not been reformed significantly since the colonial days.<ref>{{cite journal|jstor=2574763|title=Class Structure and Class Conflict in Haitian Society|first1=Roland|last1=Wingfield|first2=Vernon J.|last2=Parenton|date=1965|journal=Social Forces|volume=43|issue=3|pages=338–347|doi=10.2307/2574763}}</ref> Comprising 5% of the nation's population, mulattoes have retained their preeminence, evident in the political, economic, social and cultural hierarchy in Haiti.<ref>{{cite web|last=Smucker|first=Glenn R|url=http://lcweb2.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/r?frd/cstdy:@field%28DOCID+ht0033%29|title=A Country Study: Haiti; The Upper Class|editor=Haggerty, Richard A. |publisher=Library of Congress Federal Research Division|date=December 1989}}</ref> As a result, the elite class today consists of a small group of influential people who are generally light in color and continue to establish themselves in high, prestigious positions.<ref>{{cite journal|jstor=2769747|title=Caste and Class in Haiti|first=John|last=Lobb|date=2018|journal=American Journal of Sociology|volume=46|issue=1|pages=23–34|doi=10.1086/218523|s2cid=144100302}}</ref>

{{Culture of Haiti}}

Haiti has a rich and unique cultural identity, consisting of a blend of traditional French and African customs, mixed with sizeable contributions from the Spanish and indigenous Taíno cultures.<ref name="Yurnet-Thomas">fdan{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=giQaoQz8N0AC&pg=PA13|title=A Taste of Haiti |author=Yurnet-Thomas, Mirta |pages=13–15 |year=2002 |isbn=978-0-7818-0998-6 |access-date=18 June 2015}}</ref> Haiti's culture is greatly reflected in its paintings, music, and literature.

===Art===
{{Main|Haitian art}}

Haitian art is [[Haitian art|distinctive]], particularly through its paintings and sculptures.<ref name="Yurnet-Thomas" /><ref>{{cite web |url=http://globalfaithinaction.org/haiti-culture-and-sports/ |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120427211956/http://globalfaithinaction.org/haiti-culture-and-sports/ |url-status=dead |archive-date=27 April 2012 |title=Haiti – Culture And Sports |author=Onofre, Alejandro Guevara |access-date=2 September 2014 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.pbs.org/newshour/art/haiti/ |title=In Haiti, Art Remains a Solid Cornerstone |author=Legro, Tom |date=11 January 2011}}</ref> Brilliant colors, [[Naïve art|naïve]] perspectives, and sly humor characterize [[Haitian art]]. Frequent subjects in Haitian art include big, delectable foods, lush landscapes, market activities, jungle animals, rituals, dances, and gods. As a result of a deep history and strong African ties, symbols take on great meaning within Haitian society. For example, a rooster often represents Aristide and the red and blue colors of the Haitian flag often represent his Lavalas party.{{citation needed|date=September 2019}} Many artists cluster in 'schools' of painting, such as the Cap-Haïtien school, which features depictions of daily life in the city, the Jacmel School, which reflects the steep mountains and bays of that coastal town, or the Saint-Soleil School, which is characterised by abstracted human forms and is heavily influenced by Vodou symbolism.{{citation needed|date=April 2014}}

In the 1920s the ''indigéniste'' movement gained international acclaim, with its expressionist paintings inspired by Haiti's culture and African roots. Notable painters of this movement include [[Hector Hyppolite]], [[Philomé Oban]] and [[Préfète Duffaut]].<ref name="Bradt36">Clammer, Paul, (2016) ''Bradt Travel Guide – Haiti'', p. 36</ref> Some notable artists of more recent times include [[Edouard Duval-Carrié]], [[Frantz Zéphirin]], [[Leroy Exil]], [[Prosper Pierre Louis]] and [[Louisiane Saint Fleurant]].<ref name="Bradt36"/> Sculpture is also practised in Haiti; noted artists in this form include [[George Liautaud]] and [[Serge Jolimeau]].<ref name="Bradt37">Clammer, Paul, (2016) ''Bradt Travel Guide – Haiti'', p. 37</ref>

===Music and dance===
{{Further|Music of Haiti}}

Haitian music combines a wide range of influences drawn from the many people who have settled here. It reflects French, African and Spanish elements and others who have inhabited the island of [[Hispaniola]], and minor native [[Taino]] influences. Styles of music unique to the nation of Haiti include music derived from [[Haitian Vodou|Vodou]] ceremonial traditions, [[Rara]] parading music, [[Twoubadou]] ''ballads'', [[mini-jazz]] rock bands, [[Rasin]] movement, [[Haitian hip hop|Hip hop]] kreyòl, [[méringue]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.afropop.org/radio/radio_program/ID/692/Music%20and%20the%20Story%20of%20Haiti|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071113022326/http://www.afropop.org/radio/radio_program/ID/692/Music%20and%20the%20Story%20of%20Haiti|archive-date= 13 November 2007 |title=Music and the Story of Haiti |publisher=Afropop Worldwide}}</ref> and [[compas]].

===Literature===
{{Main|Haitian literature}}

Haiti has always been a literary nation that has produced poetry, novels, and plays of international recognition. The [[Saint Domingue|French colonial experience]] established the French language as the venue of culture and prestige, and since then it has dominated the literary circles and the literary production. However, since the 18th century there has been a sustained effort to write in [[Haitian Creole]]. The recognition of Creole as an official language has led to an expansion of novels, poems, and plays in Creole.<ref>{{Cite book |last=[http://www.voicesfromhaiti.com/2012/06/meet-dr-marie-jose-nzengou-tayo/ Nzengou-Tayo] |first= Marie-José  |title=Creole and French in Haitian Literature |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=4xbGzLuBvWwC&pg=PA153|journal=The Haitian Creole Language: History, Structure, Use, and Education |language=en |publisher=Lexington Books |pages=153–176 |isbn=978-0-7391-7221-6|date= 2012}}</ref> In 1975, [[Franketienne]] was the first to break with the French tradition in fiction with the publication of ''Dezafi,'' the first novel written entirely in Haitian Creole; the work offers a poetic picture of Haitian life.<ref>{{Cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ewyPMi4WZPAC |title=Frankétienne and Rewriting: A Work in Progress |last=Douglas |first=Rachel |publisher=Lexington Books |year=2009 |isbn=978-0-7391-3635-5 |pages=50–60}}</ref> Other well known Haitian authors include [[Jean Price-Mars]], [[Jacques Roumain]], [[Marie Vieux-Chauvet]], [[Pierre Clitandre]], [[René Depestre]], [[Edwidge Danticat]], [[Lyonel Trouillot]] and [[Dany Laferrière]].

Most people living in Haiti are at high risk for major infectious diseases. Food or [[Waterborne diseases|water-borne]] diseases include bacterial and protozoal [[diarrhea]], [[typhoid fever]] and [[hepatitis]] A and E; common [[Vector (epidemiology)|vector]]-borne diseases are [[dengue fever]] and [[malaria]]; water-contact diseases include [[leptospirosis]]. Roughly 75% of Haitian households lack running water. Unsafe water, along with inadequate housing and unsanitary living conditions, contributes to the high incidence of infectious diseases. There is a chronic shortage of health care personnel and hospitals lack resources, a situation that became readily apparent after the January 2010 earthquake.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://handle.dtic.mil/100.2/ADA528274 |title=The Geology of Haiti: An Annotated Bibliography of Haiti's Geology, Geography and Earth Science |author1=Robert Lee Hadden |author2=Steven G.

However the Viceroyalty of Mexico had little to no influence in the daily affairs of the isthmus, which was colonized in 1524. In 1609, the area was declared the [[Captaincy General of Guatemala]] by the Spanish, which included the territory that would become El Salvador until its independence from Spain in 1821. It was forcefully incorporated into the [[First Mexican Empire]], then later seceded, joining the [[Federal Republic of Central America]] in 1823. When the republic dissolved in 1841, El Salvador became a sovereign nation, then formed a short-lived union with Honduras and [[Nicaragua]] called the [[Greater Republic of Central America]], which lasted from 1895 to 1898.<ref name="Boland2001">{{cite book|first=Roy|last=Boland|title=Culture and Customs of El Salvador|url=https://archive.org/details/culturecustomsof00bola|url-access=registration|date=1 January 2001|publisher=Greenwood Publishing Group|isbn=978-0-313-30620-4|page=[https://archive.org/details/culturecustomsof00bola/page/2 2]}}</ref><ref name="IhrieOropesa2011">{{cite book|first1=Maureen|last1=Ihrie|first2=Salvador|last2=Oropesa|title=World Literature in Spanish: An Encyclopedia &#91;3 volumes&#93;: An Encyclopedia|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=zPDFHE_5besC&pg=PA332|date=20 October 2011|publisher=ABC-CLIO|isbn=978-0-313-08083-8|page=332}}</ref><ref name="Haskin2012">{{cite book|first=Jeanne M.|last=Haskin|title=From Conflict to Crisis: The Danger of U.S. Actions|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=O9hr0Ze14H0C&pg=PA152|year=2012|publisher=Algora Publishing|isbn=978-0-87586-961-2|page=152}}</ref>

From the late 19th to the mid-20th century, El Salvador endured chronic political and economic instability characterized by coups, revolts, and a succession of authoritarian rulers. Persistent socioeconomic inequality and civil unrest culminated in the devastating [[Salvadoran Civil War]] from 1979 to 1992, fought between the military-led government and a coalition of left-wing [[Guerrilla warfare|guerrilla]] groups. The conflict ended with the [[Chapultepec Peace Accords]]. This negotiated settlement established a multiparty constitutional republic, which remains in place to this day.

While this Civil War was going on in the country large numbers of Salvadorans immigrated to the United States, resulting in an immigrant population comparable to that of China's. Although China's territory is 500 times larger and the population is 200 times larger, by 2008 there were nearly as many Salvadoran immigrants to the United States as Chinese immigrants to the United States.<ref>{{Cite web|last=Terrazas|first=Aaron Terrazas Aaron|date=2010-01-05|title=Salvadoran Immigrants in the United States in 2008|url=https://www.migrationpolicy.org/article/salvadoran-immigrants-united-states-2008|access-date=2020-10-25|website=migrationpolicy.org|language=en}}</ref>{{clarify|date=December 2020}}

El Salvador's economy has historically been dominated by agriculture, beginning with the Spanish taking control of the indigenous cacao crop in the 16th century, with production centered in [[Izalco]], and the use of balsam from the ranges of [[La Libertad Department (El Salvador)|La Libertad]] and [[Ahuachapán Department|Ahuachapan]]. This was followed by a boom in use of the [[Indigofera|indigo plant]] (''añil'' in Spanish) in the 19th century, mainly for its use as a dye.<ref name="Montgomery1995">{{cite book|author=Tommie Sue Montgomery|title=Revolution in El Salvador: From Civil Strife to Civil Peace|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=6xTklQxPGe8C&pg=PA27|year=1995|publisher=Westview Press|isbn=978-0-8133-0071-9|page=27}}</ref><ref name="Murray1997">{{cite book|first=Kevin|last=Murray|title=El Salvador: Peace on Trial|url=https://archive.org/details/elsalvadorpeaceo0000murr|url-access=registration|date=1 January 1997|publisher=Oxfam|isbn=978-0-85598-361-1|pages=[https://archive.org/details/elsalvadorpeaceo0000murr/page/8 8]–}}</ref> Thereafter the focus shifted to [[coffee]], which by the early 20th century accounted for 90% of export earnings.<ref name="Boland2001b">{{cite book|first=Roy|last=Boland|title=Culture and Customs of El Salvador|url=https://archive.org/details/culturecustomsof00bola|url-access=registration|date=1 January 2001|publisher=Greenwood Publishing Group|isbn=978-0-313-30620-4|page=[https://archive.org/details/culturecustomsof00bola/page/8 8]}}</ref><ref name="Pearcy2006">{{cite book|first=Thomas L.|last=Pearcy|title=The History of Central America|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=BJRoO1VWCSYC&pg=PA43|year=2006|publisher=Greenwood Publishing Group|isbn=978-0-313-32293-8|page=43}}</ref> El Salvador has since reduced its dependence on coffee and embarked on diversifying its economy by opening up trade and financial links and expanding the manufacturing sector.<ref name="FoleyHapipi2005">{{cite book|first1=Erin|last1=Foley|first2=Rafiz|last2=Hapipi|title=El Salvador|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=PPwwabJIEdkC&pg=PA43|year=2005|publisher=Marshall Cavendish|isbn=978-0-7614-1967-9|page=43}}</ref> The [[Salvadoran colón|colón]], the currency of El Salvador since 1892, was replaced by the [[United States dollar]] in 2001, by Francisco Flores.{{cn|date=February 2021}}

===Prehistoric===
[[File:Toma2.gif|thumb|Excavation of a [[Megatherium]] in the Tomayate site [[Apopa]].]]
[[File:Toma4.gif|thumb|Skull fossil of an ancient horse in the Tomayate site [[Apopa]].]]

Tomayate is a palaeontological site located on the banks of the river of the same name in the municipality of [[Apopa]]. The site has produced abundant Salvadoran [[megafauna]] fossils belonging to the [[Pleistocene]]. The palaeontological site was discovered accidentally in 2000, and in the following year, an excavation by the Museum of Natural History of El Salvador revealed several remnants of [[Cuvieronius]] and 18 other species of vertebrates including [[giant tortoise]]s, [[Megatherium]], [[Glyptodon]], [[Toxodon]], extinct horses, paleo-llamas. The site stands out from most Central American Pleistocene deposits, being more ancient and much richer, which provides valuable information of the [[Great American Interchange]], in which the Central American isthmus land bridge was paramount. At the same time, it is considered the richest vertebrate site in Central America and one of the largest accumulations of [[proboscidea]]ns in the Americas.

====Conquest of Cuzcatlán and Managuara====
{{main|Spanish conquest of El Salvador}}
[[File:Pedro de Alvarado.JPG|thumb|upright|Spanish Conquistador [[Pedro de Alvarado]].]]

In 1524, after participating in the [[Spanish conquest of the Aztec Empire|conquest of the Aztec Empire]], [[Pedro de Alvarado]], his brother Gonzalo, and their men crossed the [[Paz River|Rio Paz]] southward into Cuzcatlec territory. The Spaniards were disappointed to discover that the Pipil had no gold or jewels like those they had found in Guatemala or Mexico,<ref name="Minahan2013">{{cite book|first=James B.|last=Minahan|title=Ethnic Groups of the Americas: An Encyclopedia: An Encyclopedia|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=OJilCCGFCTYC&pg=PA295|date=14 March 2013|publisher=ABC-CLIO|isbn=978-1-61069-164-2|page=295}}</ref> but they recognized the richness of the land's volcanic soil.

Alvarado approached, confident that the result would be similar to what occurred in Mexico and Guatemala. He thought he would easily deal this new indigenous force since the Mexican allies on his side and the Pipil spoke a similar language.<ref name="Pan AmericanUnion1934">{{cite book|author=Lily de Jongh Osborne|title=Index to the Bulletin of the Pan American Union|chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=7aobAAAAMAAJ&pg=PA182|series=1-12|volume=LXVII|year=1934|publisher=Pan American Union|page=182|chapter=El Salvador}}</ref>

Alvarado described the Cuzcatlec soldiers as having shields decorated with colourful exotic feathers, a vest-like armour made of three inch cotton which arrows could not penetrate, and long spears. Both armies suffered many casualties, with a wounded Alvarado retreating and losing a lot of his men, especially among the Mexican Indian auxiliaries. Once his army had regrouped, Alvarado decided to head to the Cuzcatlan capital and again faced armed Cuzcatlec. Wounded, unable to fight and hiding in the cliffs, Alvarado sent his Spanish men on their horses to approach the Cuzcatlec to see if they would fear the horses, but they did not retreat, Alvarado recalls in his letters to [[Hernán Cortés]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.fundar.org.sv/referencias/buscacuscatlan.pdf|title=En la Búsqueda de Cuscatlan|last=Amaroli|first=Paul|date=1986|website=FUNDAR|access-date=April 4, 2020}}</ref>

The Cuzcatlec attacked again, and on this occasion stole Spanish weaponry. Alvarado retreated and sent Mexican messengers to demand that the Cuzcatlec warriors return the stolen weapons and surrender to their opponent's king. The Cuzcatlec responded with the famous response, "If you want your weapons, come get them". As days passed, Alvarado, fearing an ambush, sent more Mexican messengers to negotiate, but these messengers never came back and were presumably executed.

[[File:Tazumal 10.jpg|thumb|[[Tazumal]] ruins in Santa Ana, El Salvador.]]

The Spanish efforts were firmly resisted by Pipil and their Mayan-speaking neighbours. They defeated the Spaniards and what was left of their [[Tlaxcala]]n allies, forcing them to withdraw to Guatemala. After being wounded, Alvarado abandoned the war and appointed his brother, [[Gonzalo de Alvarado]], to continue the task. Two subsequent expeditions (the first in 1525, followed by a smaller group in 1528) brought the Pipil under Spanish control, since the Pipil also were weakened by a regional epidemic of smallpox. In 1525, the conquest of Cuzcatlán was completed and the city of San Salvador was established. The Spanish faced much resistance from the Pipil and were not able to reach eastern El Salvador, the area of the Lencas.

In 1526 the Spanish founded the garrison town of [[San Miguel, El Salvador|San Miguel]] in northern Managuara—territory of the Lenca, headed by another explorer and conquistador, [[Luis de Moscoso Alvarado]], nephew of Pedro Alvarado. Oral history holds that a Maya-Lenca crown princess, Antu Silan Ulap I, organized resistance to the conquistadors.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.justice.gov/sites/default/files/eoir/legacy/2014/02/19/Indigenous%20peoples_1.pdf |title=World Directory of Minorities |author=Minority Rights Group International |access-date=3 June 2016}}</ref> The kingdom of the Lenca was alarmed by de Moscoso's invasion, and Antu Silan travelled from village to village, uniting all the Lenca towns in present-day El Salvador and Honduras against the Spaniards. Through surprise attacks and overwhelming numbers, they were able to drive the Spanish out of San Miguel and destroy the garrison.

For ten years the Lencas prevented the Spanish from building a permanent settlement. Then the Spanish returned with more soldiers, including about 2,000 forced conscripts from indigenous communities in Guatemala. They pursued the Lenca leaders further up into the mountains of [[Intibucá Department|Intibucá]].

Antu Silan Ulap eventually handed over control of the Lenca resistance to [[Lempira (Lenca ruler)|Lempira]] (also called Empira). Lempira was noteworthy among indigenous leaders in that he mocked the Spanish by wearing their clothes after capturing them and using their weapons captured in battle. Lempira fought in command of thousands of Lenca forces for six more years in Managuara until he was killed in battle. The remaining Lenca forces retreated into the hills. The Spanish were then able to rebuild their garrison town of San Miguel in 1537.

=== Colonial period (1525–1821) ===
[[File:Proclama de libertad (indep. Centroamérica).jpg|thumb|A painting of the First Independence Movement celebration in San Salvador. At the centre, [[José Matías Delgado]].]]
[[File:MANUEL JOSE ARCE PICTURE.jpg|upright|thumb|[[Manuel José Arce]] joined the movement for independence from Spain, joining in the first Cry for Independence on 5 November 1811 in San Salvador.]]

During the colonial period, San Salvador and San Miguel were part of the Captaincy General of Guatemala, also known as the Kingdom of Guatemala ({{lang-es|Reino de Guatemala}}), created in 1609 as an administrative division of [[New Spain]]. The Salvadoran territory was administered by the Mayor of Sonsonate, with San Salvador being established as an ''[[Intendancy of San Salvador|intendencia]]'' in 1786.

In 1811, a combination of internal and external factors motivated Central American elites to attempt to gain independence from the Spanish Crown. The most important internal factors were the desire of local elites to control the country's affairs free of involvement from Spanish authorities, and the long-standing Creole aspiration for independence. The main external factors motivating the independence movement were the success of the [[French Revolution|French]] and [[American Revolution|American]] revolutions in the 18th century, and the weakening of the Spanish Crown's military power as a result of the [[Napoleonic Wars]], with the resulting inability to control its colonies effectively.

In November 1811 Salvadoran priest [[José Matías Delgado]] rang the bells of Iglesia La Merced in San Salvador, calling for insurrection and launching the [[1811 Independence Movement]]. This insurrection was suppressed, and many of its leaders were arrested and served sentences in jail. Another insurrection was launched in 1814, which was also suppressed.

=== Independence (1821) ===
In 1821 in light of unrest in Guatemala, Spanish authorities capitulated and signed the [[Act of Independence of Central America]], which released all of the Captaincy of Guatemala (comprising current territories of Guatemala, El Salvador, Honduras, Nicaragua and Costa Rica and the Mexican state of [[Chiapas]]) from Spanish rule and declared its independence. In 1821, El Salvador joined Costa Rica, Guatemala, Honduras and Nicaragua in a union named the [[Federal Republic of Central America]].

In early 1822, the authorities of the newly independent Central American provinces, meeting in Guatemala City, voted to join the newly constituted [[First Mexican Empire]] under [[Agustín de Iturbide]]. El Salvador resisted, insisting on autonomy for the Central American countries. A Mexican military detachment marched to San Salvador and suppressed dissent, but with the fall of Iturbide on 19 March 1823, the army decamped back to Mexico. Shortly thereafter, the authorities of the provinces revoked the vote to join Mexico, deciding instead to form a federal union of the five remaining provinces. (Chiapas permanently joined Mexico at this juncture.) When the Federal Republic of Central America dissolved in 1841, El Salvador maintained its own government until it joined Honduras and Nicaragua in 1896 to form the [[Greater Republic of Central America]], which dissolved in 1898.

After the mid-19th century, the economy was based on coffee growing. As the world market for indigo withered away, the economy prospered or suffered as the world coffee price fluctuated. The enormous profits that coffee yielded as a monoculture export served as an impetus for the concentration of land into the hands of an oligarchy of just a few families.<ref>{{cite book |first=Thomas P. |last=Anderson |title=Politics in Central America: Guatemala, El Salvador, Honduras, and Nicaragua |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=uar_iWVhSaIC |access-date=29 July 2012 |year=1988 |via=Google Books |publisher=Greenwood Publishing Group |isbn=978-0-275-92883-4}}</ref> Throughout the last half of the 19th century, a succession of presidents from the ranks of the Salvadoran oligarchy, nominally both conservative and liberal, generally agreed on the promotion of coffee as the predominant [[cash crop]], the development of infrastructure (railroads and port facilities) primarily in support of the coffee trade, the elimination of communal landholdings to facilitate further coffee production, the passage of anti-[[vagrancy]] laws to ensure that displaced [[Peasant|campesinos]] and other rural residents provided sufficient labour for the coffee fincas (plantations), and the suppression of rural discontent. In 1912, the national guard was created as a rural police force.

===20th century===
[[File:Tomas Regalado1.jpg|thumb|upright|Gen. Tomás Regalado]]

In 1898, General [[Tomás Regalado (Salvadoran politician)|Tomas Regalado]] gained power by force, deposing [[Rafael Antonio Gutiérrez]] and ruling as president until 1903. Once in office he revived the practice of presidents designating their successors. After serving his term, he remained active in the Army of El Salvador and was killed 11 July 1906, at El Jicaro during a [[Totoposte Wars|war against Guatemala]]. Until 1913 El Salvador was politically stable, with undercurrents of popular discontent. When President [[Manuel Enrique Araujo]] was killed in 1913, many hypotheses were advanced for the political motive of his murder.

[[File:Civil Ensign of El Salvador.svg|thumb|upright|Dios, Union, Libertad (God, Union, Liberty) El Salvador 1912 Flag.]]

Araujo's administration was followed by the Melendez-Quinonez dynasty that lasted from 1913 to 1927. [[Pío Romero Bosque|Pio Romero Bosque]], ex-Minister of the Government and a trusted collaborator of the dynasty, succeeded President [[Jorge Meléndez]] and in 1930 announced free elections, in which [[Arturo Araujo]] came to power on 1 March 1931 in what was considered the country's first freely contested election. His government lasted only nine months before it was overthrown by junior military officers who accused his Labor Party of lacking political and governmental experience and of using its government offices inefficiently. President Araujo faced general popular discontent, as the people had expected economic reforms and the redistribution of land. There were demonstrations in front of the National Palace from the first week of his administration. His vice president and minister of war was General [[Maximiliano Hernández Martínez]].

In December 1931, a [[1931 Salvadoran coup d'état|coup d'état was organized]] by junior officers and led by Martínez. Only the First Regiment of Cavalry and the National Police defended the presidency (the National Police had been on its payroll), but later that night, after hours of fighting, the badly outnumbered defenders surrendered to rebel forces. The Directorate, composed of officers, hid behind a shadowy figure,<ref>{{cite book|first=Thomas P. |last=Anderson |title=Matanza: The 1932 "Slaughter" That Traumatized a Nation, Shaping US-Salvadoran Policy to This Day |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=w5xqAAAAMAAJ |access-date=29 July 2012 |year=1992 |publisher=Curbstone Press |isbn=978-1-880684-04-7}}</ref> a rich anti-Communist banker called Rodolfo Duke, and later installed the ardent fascist Martínez as president. The revolt was probably caused by the army's discontent at not having been paid by President Araujo for some months. Araujo left the National Palace and unsuccessfully tried to organize forces to defeat the revolt.

The U.S. Minister in El Salvador met with the Directorate and later recognized the government of Martínez, which agreed to hold presidential elections. He resigned six months prior to running for re-election, winning back the presidency as the only candidate on the ballot. He ruled from 1935 to 1939, then from 1939 to 1943. He began a fourth term in 1944 but resigned in May after a general strike. Martínez had said he was going to respect the constitution, which stipulated he could not be re-elected, but he refused to keep his promise.

==== La Matanza ====
From December 1931, the year of the coup that brought Martínez to power, there was brutal suppression of rural resistance. The most notable event was the February [[La Matanza|1932 Salvadoran peasant uprising]], originally led by [[Farabundo Martí]] and Abel Cuenca, and university students Alfonso Luna and Mario Zapata, but these leaders were captured before the planned insurrection. Only Cuenca survived; the other insurgents were killed by the government. After the capture of the movement leaders, the insurrection erupted in a disorganized and mob-controlled fashion, resulting in government repression that was later referred to as La Matanza (The Massacre), because tens of thousands of citizens died in the ensuing chaos on the orders of President Martinez.

In the unstable political climate of the previous few years, the social activist and revolutionary leader Farabundo Martí helped found the Communist Party of Central America, and led a Communist alternative to the Red Cross called International Red Aid, serving as one of its representatives. Their goal was to help poor and underprivileged Salvadorans through the use of [[Marxism–Leninism|Marxist-Leninist]] ideology (strongly rejecting [[Stalinism]]). In December 1930, at the height of the country's economic and social depression, Martí was once again exiled because of his popularity among the nation's poor and rumours of his upcoming nomination for president the following year. Once Arturo Araujo was elected president in 1931, Martí returned to El Salvador, and along with Alfonso Luna and Mario Zapata began the movement that was later truncated by the military.

[[File:José Napoleón Duarte 1987b.jpg|thumb|upright|[[José Napoleón Duarte]]]]

They helped start a guerrilla revolt of indigenous farmers. The government responded by killing over 30,000 people at what was to have been a "peaceful meeting" in 1932. The peasant uprising against Martínez was crushed by the Salvadoran military ten days after it had begun. The Communist-led rebellion, fomented by collapsing coffee prices, enjoyed some initial success, but was soon drowned in a bloodbath. President Martínez, who had toppled an elected government only weeks earlier, ordered the defeated Martí shot after a perfunctory hearing.

Historically, the high Salvadoran population density has contributed to tensions with neighbouring [[Honduras]], as land-poor Salvadorans emigrated to less densely populated Honduras and established themselves as squatters on unused or underused land.

The [[Christian Democratic Party (El Salvador)|Christian Democratic Party]] (PDC) and the [[National Coalition Party (El Salvador)|National Conciliation Party]] (PCN) were active in Salvadoran politics from 1960 until 2011, when they were disbanded by the Supreme Court because they had failed to win enough votes in the 2004 presidential election;<ref>{{cite news |author=<!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--> |title=El Salvador Supreme Court disbands two parties |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-latin-america-13251247 |work=BBC News |date=2011-04-30 |access-date=2014-07-02 }}</ref> Both parties have since reconstituted.  They share common ideals, but one represents the middle class and the latter the interests of the Salvadoran military.

PDC leader [[José Napoleón Duarte]] was the mayor of [[San Salvador]] from 1964 to 1970, winning three elections during the regime of PCN President [[Julio Adalberto Rivera Carballo]], who allowed free elections for mayors and the National Assembly. Duarte later ran for president with a political grouping called the [[National Opposition Union]] (UNO) but was defeated in the 1972 presidential elections. He lost to the ex-Minister of Interior, Col. [[Arturo Armando Molina]], in an election that was widely viewed as fraudulent; Molina was declared the winner even though Duarte was said to have received a majority of the votes. Duarte, at some army officers' request, supported a revolt to protest the election fraud, but was captured, tortured and later exiled. Duarte returned to the country in 1979 to enter politics after working on projects in Venezuela as an engineer.

=== Salvadoran Civil War (1979–1992) ===
{{Further|Salvadoran Civil War}}

On 15 October 1979, a [[1979 Salvadoran coup d'état|coup d'état]] brought the [[Revolutionary Government Junta of El Salvador]] to power. It nationalized many private companies and took over much privately owned land. The purpose of this new junta was to stop the revolutionary movement already underway in response to Duarte's stolen election. Nevertheless, the oligarchy opposed [[agrarian reform]], and a junta formed with young liberal elements from the army such as [[Adolfo Arnoldo Majano|Gen. Majano]] and [[Jaime Abdul Gutiérrez|Gen. Gutierrez]],<ref>{{cite web |title=Román Mayorga asume embajada en Venezuela |url=http://www.elsalvador.com/mwedh/nota/nota_completa.asp?idCat=6351&idArt=4199885 |website=elsalvador.com |access-date=17 March 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140811214354/http://www.elsalvador.com/mwedh/nota/nota_completa.asp?idCat=6351&idArt=4199885 |archive-date=11 August 2014 |date=29 October 2009 |url-status=dead}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=Chronology of the Civil War in El Salvador |url=http://kellogg.nd.edu/romero/Salvador.htm |website=Kellogg Institute for International Studies |publisher=University of Notre Dame |access-date=17 March 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170408194257/http://kellogg.nd.edu/romero/Salvador.htm |archive-date=8 April 2017 |url-status=dead}}</ref> as well as with progressives such as [[Guillermo Ungo]] and Alvarez.

[[File:Masakro-ĉe-Suchitoto-Salvadoro.jpg|thumb|left|A billboard serving as a reminder of one of many [[List of massacres in El Salvador|massacres]] that occurred during the civil war.]]

Pressure from the oligarchy soon dissolved the junta because of its inability to control the army in its repression of the people fighting for unionization rights, agrarian reform, better wages, accessible health care and freedom of expression. In the meantime, the guerrilla movement was spreading to all sectors of Salvadoran society. Middle and high school students were organized in MERS (Movimiento Estudiantil Revolucionario de Secundaria, Revolutionary Movement of Secondary Students); college students were involved with AGEUS (Asociacion de Estudiantes Universitarios Salvadorenos; Association of Salvadoran College Students); and workers were organized in BPR (Bloque Popular Revolucionario, Popular Revolutionary Block). In October 1980, several other major guerrilla groups of the Salvadoran left had formed the [[Farabundo Martí National Liberation Front]], or FMLN. By the end of the 1970s, government-contracted death squads were killing about 10 people each day. Meanwhile, the FMLN had 6,000 – 8,000 active guerrillas and hundreds of thousands of part-time militia, supporters, and sympathizers.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Mason |first=T.D. |author2=D.A.

The U.S. supported and financed the creation of a second junta to change the political environment and stop the spread of a leftist insurrection. Napoleón Duarte was recalled from his exile in Venezuela to head this new junta. However, a revolution was already underway and his new role as head of the junta was seen by the general population as opportunistic. He was unable to influence the outcome of the insurrection. [[Óscar Romero]], the [[Roman Catholic]] Archbishop of San Salvador, denounced injustices and massacres committed against civilians by government forces. He was considered "the voice of the voiceless", but he was assassinated by a [[death squad]] while saying Mass on 24 March 1980.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Golden |first1=Renny |title=Oscar Romero: Bishop of the Poor |url=http://www.uscatholic.org/culture/social-justice/2009/02/oscar-romero-bishop-poor |website=U.S. Catholic |access-date=17 March 2020 |date=25 February 2009}}</ref> Some consider this to be the beginning of the full [[Salvadoran Civil War]], which lasted from 1980 to 1992.

On 16 January 1992, the government of El Salvador, represented by president [[Alfredo Cristiani]], and the [[FMLN]], represented by the commanders of the five guerrilla groups – [[Shafik Handal]], [[Joaquín Villalobos]], [[Salvador Sánchez Cerén]], Francisco Jovel and [[Fermán Cienfuegos|Eduardo Sancho]], all signed peace agreements brokered by the United Nations ending the 12-year civil war. This event, held at [[Chapultepec Castle]] in Mexico, was attended by U.N. dignitaries and other representatives of the international community. After signing the armistice, the president stood up and shook hands with all the now ex-guerrilla commanders, an action which was widely admired.

=== Post-war (1992–present) ===
The so-called [[Chapultepec Peace Accords]] mandated reductions in the size of the army, and the dissolution of the National Police, the Treasury Police, the National Guard and the Civilian Defence, a paramilitary group. A new Civil Police was to be organized. Judicial immunity for crimes committed by the armed forces ended; the government agreed to submit to the recommendations of a [[Commission on the Truth for El Salvador]] ''(Comisión de la Verdad Para El Salvador)'', which would "investigate serious acts of violence occurring since 1980, and the nature and effects of the violence, and...recommend methods of promoting national reconciliation". In 1993 the Commission delivered its findings reporting human rights violations on both sides of the conflict.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Betancur |first1=Belisario |last2=Planchart |first2=Reinaldo Figueredo |last3=Buergenthal |first3=Thomas |title=From Madness to Hope: The 12-Year War in El Salvador: Report of the Commission on the Truth for El Salvador |url=https://www.usip.org/sites/default/files/file/ElSalvador-Report.pdf |website=United States Institute for Peace |publisher=The Commission on the Truth for El Salvador |access-date=17 March 2020 |date=1 January 1993}}</ref> Five days later the El Salvadoran legislature passed an amnesty law for all acts of violence during the period.

From 1989 until 2004, Salvadorans favoured the [[Nationalist Republican Alliance]] (ARENA) party, voting in ARENA presidents in every election ([[Alfredo Cristiani]], [[Armando Calderón Sol]], [[Francisco Flores Pérez]], [[Antonio Saca]]) until 2009. The unsuccessful attempts of the left-wing party to win presidential elections led to its selection of a journalist rather than a former guerrilla leader as a candidate. On 15 March 2009, [[Mauricio Funes]], a television figure, became the first president from the [[Farabundo Martí National Liberation Front]] (FMLN) party. He was inaugurated on 1 June 2009. One focus of the Funes government has been revealing the alleged corruption from the past government.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.diariocolatino.com/es/20090612/nacionales/67865/ |title=Funes saca a luz corrupción en gobiernos de ARENA |publisher=Diario CoLatino |year=2009 |language=es |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140706065656/http://www.diariocolatino.com/es/20090612/nacionales/67865/ |archive-date=2014-07-06 }}</ref>

ARENA formally expelled Saca from the party in December 2009. With 12 loyalists in the National Assembly, Saca established his own party, GANA (Gran Alianza por la Unidad Nacional or [[Grand Alliance for National Unity]]), and entered into a tactical legislative alliance with the FMLN.<ref>{{cite web |title=ARENA Expels Former President Saca |url=https://wikileaks.org/plusd/cables/09SANSALVADOR1103_a.html |website=WikiLeaks |publisher=United States Embassy San Salvador |access-date=17 March 2020 |date=15 December 2009}}</ref> After three years in office, with Saca's GANA party providing the FMLN with a legislative majority, Funes had not taken action to either investigate or to bring corrupt former officials to justice.

Economic reforms since the early 1990s brought major benefits in terms of improved social conditions, diversification of the export sector, and access to international financial markets at investment grade level. Crime remains a major problem for the investment climate.Early in the new millennium, El Salvador's government created the Ministerio de Medio Ambiente y Recursos Naturales&nbsp;— the Ministry of Environment and Natural Resources (MARN)&nbsp;— in response to climate change concerns.<ref name="cdkn.org">{{cite web |title=El Salvador builds resilience in the face of a stormy future |url=https://cdkn.org/2013/12/el-salvador-builds-resilience-in-face-of-a-stormy-future/?loclang=en_gb |website=Climate & Development Knowledge Network |access-date=17 March 2020 |date=24 December 2013}}</ref>

==Geography==
{{Main|Geography of El Salvador}}
[[File:Cerro verde.jpg|thumb|center|upright=2.75|Panoramic of [[Coatepeque Caldera]], Cerro Verde and [[Izalco (volcano)]]]]
[[File:Un-el-salvador.png|thumb|upright=1.3|A map of El Salvador]]
[[File:El Salvador Topography.png|thumb|upright=1.2|El Salvador's topography.]]

El Salvador lies in the isthmus of Central America between latitudes [[13th parallel north|13°]] and [[15th parallel north|15°N]], and longitudes [[87th meridian west|87°]] and [[91st meridian west|91°W]]. It stretches {{convert|168|mi|km|order=flip|abbr=on}} from west-northwest to east-southeast and {{convert|88|mi|km|order=flip|abbr=on}} north to south, with a total area of {{convert|21,041|km2|sqmi|abbr=on}}. As the smallest country in continental America, El Salvador is affectionately called ''Pulgarcito de America'' (the "[[Tom Thumb]] of the Americas"). El Salvador shares borders with Guatemala and Honduras, the total national boundary length is {{convert|339|mi|km|order=flip|abbr=on}}: {{convert|126|mi|km}} with Guatemala and {{convert|213|mi|km|order=flip|abbr=on}} with Honduras. It is the only Central American country that has no Caribbean coastline. The coastline on the Pacific is {{convert|191|mi|km|order=flip|abbr=on}} long.

El Salvador has over 300 rivers, the most important of which is the [[Lempa River|Rio Lempa]]. Originating in Guatemala, the Rio Lempa cuts across the northern range of mountains, flows along much of the central plateau, and cuts through the southern volcanic range to empty into the Pacific. It is El Salvador's only navigable river. It and its tributaries drain about half of the country's area. Other rivers are generally short and drain the Pacific lowlands or flow from the central plateau through gaps in the southern mountain range to the Pacific. These include the [[Goascorán River|Goascorán]], [[Jiboa River|Jiboa]], [[Torola River|Torola]], [[Paz River|Paz]] and the [[Río Grande de San Miguel]].

There are several lakes enclosed by volcanic craters in El Salvador, the most important of which are [[Lake Ilopango]] ({{cvt|70|km2|disp=or}}) and [[Lake Coatepeque]] ({{cvt|26|km2|disp=or}}). [[Lake Güija]] is El Salvador's largest natural lake ({{cvt|44|km2|disp=or}}). Several artificial lakes were created by the damming of the Lempa, the largest of which is [[Cerrón Grande Hydroelectric Dam|Embalse Cerrón Grande]] ({{cvt|135|km2|disp=or}}). There are a total {{convert|123.6|sqmi|km2|order=flip|abbr=on}} of water within El Salvador's borders.

The highest point in El Salvador is [[Cerro El Pital]], at {{convert|8,957|ft|m|order=flip}}, on the border with Honduras. Two parallel mountain ranges cross El Salvador to the west with a central plateau between them and a narrow coastal plain hugging the Pacific. These physical features divide the country into two physiographic regions. The mountain ranges and central plateau, covering 85% of the land, comprise the interior highlands. The remaining coastal plains are referred to as the Pacific lowlands.

===Climate===
{{Main|Climate of El Salvador}}
[[File:Koppen-Geiger Map SLV present.svg|thumb|Köppen climate classification of El Salvador.]]

El Salvador has a [[tropical climate]] with pronounced wet and dry seasons. Temperatures vary primarily with elevation and show little seasonal change. The Pacific lowlands are uniformly hot; the central plateau and mountain areas are more moderate. The rainy season extends from May to October; this time of year is referred to as ''invierno'' or winter. Almost all the annual rainfall occurs during this period; yearly totals, particularly on southern-facing mountain slopes, can be as high as 2170&nbsp;mm. Protected areas and the central plateau receive less, although still significant, amounts. Rainfall during this season generally comes from low pressure systems formed over the Pacific and usually falls in heavy afternoon thunderstorms.

From November through April, the northeast [[trade winds]] control weather patterns; this time of year is referred to as ''verano'', or summer. During these months, air flowing from the Caribbean has lost most of its precipitation while passing over the mountains in Honduras. By the time this air reaches El Salvador, it is dry, hot, and hazy, and the country experiences hot weather, excluding the northern higher mountain ranges, where temperatures are generally cooler.

===Natural disasters===

====Extreme weather events====
[[File:Salcoatitán, El Salvador - panoramio (9).jpg|thumb|Volcanic range, [[Cordillera de Apaneca]], view from [[Salcoatitán]]]]
El Salvador's position on the Pacific Ocean also makes it subject to severe weather conditions, including heavy rainstorms and severe droughts, both of which may be made more extreme by the [[El Niño]] and [[La Niña]] effects.<ref>[http://cdkn.org/2013/12/el-salvador-builds-resilience-in-face-of-a-stormy-future/?loclang=en_gb El Salvador builds resilience in the face of a stormy future] [[Climate & Development Knowledge Network]], 24 December 2013</ref> Hurricanes occasionally form in the Pacific with the notable exception of [[Hurricane Mitch]], which formed in the Atlantic and crossed Central America.

In the summer of 2001 a severe drought destroyed 80% of El Salvador's crops, causing famine in the countryside.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.pbs.org/wnet/wideangle/shows/elsalvador/photo6.html|title=Photo Essay: El Salvador, the Makings of a Gangland|publisher=Pbs.org|date= 2006-07-11|access-date=2010-05-02}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.fiu.edu/~oberbaue/el_salvador.pdf|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070702202332/http://www.fiu.edu/~oberbaue/el_salvador.pdf|archive-date=2007-07-02|title=El Salvador|work=Fiu.edu|access-date=2010-05-02}}</ref> On 4 October 2005, severe rains resulted in dangerous flooding and landslides, which caused at least 50 deaths.<ref name="tdfiyp"/>

====Earthquakes and volcanic activity====
[[File:Vulkan Chaparrastique, El Salvador 2013 01.JPG|thumb|[[San Miguel (volcano)|San Miguel]] volcano in 2013]]
El Salvador lies along the Pacific [[Ring of Fire]] and is thus subject to significant tectonic activity, including frequent [[earthquake]]s and [[volcano|volcanic]] activity. The capital San Salvador was destroyed in 1756 and 1854, and it suffered heavy damage in the 1919, 1982, and 1986 tremors. Recent examples include the earthquake on 13 January 2001 that measured 7.7 on the [[Richter magnitude scale]] and caused a [[landslide]] that killed more than 800 people;<ref name="tdfiyp">{{cite web |url=https://travel.state.gov/travel/cis_pa_tw/cis/cis_1109.html |title=El Salvador landslide |publisher=Travel.state.gov |access-date=2010-05-02 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100510070619/http://travel.state.gov/travel/cis_pa_tw/cis/cis_1109.html |archive-date=2010-05-10 }}</ref> and another earthquake only a month later, on 13 February 2001, that killed 255 people and damaged about 20% of the nation's housing.

El Salvador has over twenty volcanoes; two of them, San Miguel and [[Izalco (volcano)|Izalco]], have been active in recent years. From the early 19th century to the mid-1950s, Izalco erupted with a regularity that earned it the name "Lighthouse of the Pacific". Its brilliant flares were clearly visible for great distances at sea, and at night its glowing lava turned it into a brilliant luminous cone. The most recent destructive volcanic eruption took place on 1 October 2005, when the [[Santa Ana Volcano]] spewed a cloud of ash, hot mud and rocks that fell on nearby villages and caused two deaths. The most severe volcanic eruption in this area occurred in the 5th century AD when the [[Lake Ilopango|Ilopango]] volcano erupted with a [[Volcanic Explosivity Index|VEI]] strength of 6, producing widespread [[pyroclastic flow]]s and devastating [[Maya civilization|Mayan cities]].<ref>{{cite journal|last=Dull|first=Robert A.|year=2001|title=Volcanism, Ecology and Culture: A Reassessment of the Volcan Ilopango Tbj eruption in the Southern Maya Realm|journal=Latin American Antiquity|volume=12 |issue=1|pages=25–44|doi=10.2307/971755|author2=Southon|author3=Sheets|jstor=971755}}</ref>

===Flora and fauna===
[[File:Eumomota superciliosa.jpg|thumb|The [[torogoz]] is El Salvador's national bird.]]

It is estimated that there are 500 species of birds, 1,000 species of butterflies, 400 species of orchids, 800 species of trees, and 800 species of marine fish in El Salvador.

There are eight species of sea turtles in the world; six of them nest on the coasts of Central America, and four make their home on the Salvadoran coast: the [[Leatherback sea turtle|leatherback turtle]], the [[Hawksbill sea turtle|hawksbill]], the [[green sea turtle]], and the [[olive ridley sea turtle|olive ridley]]. The hawksbill is critically endangered.

Recent conservation efforts provide hope for the future of the country's biological diversity. In 1997, the government established the Ministry of the Environment and Natural Resources. A general environmental framework law was approved by the National Assembly in 1999. Several non-governmental organizations are doing work to safeguard some of the country's most important forested areas. Foremost among these is SalvaNatura, which manages El Impossible, the country's largest national park under an agreement with El Salvador's environmental authorities.

El Salvador is home to six terrestrial ecosystems: [[Central American montane forests]], [[Sierra Madre de Chiapas moist forests]], [[Central American dry forests]], [[Central American pine-oak forests]], [[Gulf of Fonseca mangroves]], and [[Northern Dry Pacific Coast mangroves]].<ref name="DinersteinOlson2017">{{cite journal|last1=Dinerstein|first1=Eric|last2=Olson|first2=David|last3=Joshi|first3=Anup|last4=Vynne|first4=Carly|last5=Burgess|first5=Neil D.|last6=Wikramanayake|first6=Eric|last7=Hahn|first7=Nathan|last8=Palminteri|first8=Suzanne|last9=Hedao|first9=Prashant|last10=Noss|first10=Reed|last11=Hansen|first11=Matt|last12=Locke|first12=Harvey|last13=Ellis|first13=Erle C|last14=Jones|first14=Benjamin|last15=Barber|first15=Charles Victor|last16=Hayes|first16=Randy|last17=Kormos|first17=Cyril|last18=Martin|first18=Vance|last19=Crist|first19=Eileen|last20=Sechrest|first20=Wes|last21=Price|first21=Lori|last22=Baillie|first22=Jonathan E.

==Government and politics==
The 1983 constitution is the highest legal authority in the country. El Salvador has a democratic and representative government, whose three bodies are:
[[File:Sesion Solemne de Legislatura 2015-2018 (17866066655).jpg|thumb|Salvadoran cadets in the Legislative Assembly of El Salvador]]
# The Executive Branch, headed by the President of the Republic, who is elected by direct vote and remains in office for five years with no re-election but he can be elected after sitting out one electoral period.

[[File:ANIVERSARIO DE LA CONSTITUCION (23168818313).jpg|thumb|[[Legislative Assembly of El Salvador]]]]
El Salvador has a [[multi-party system]]. Two [[political parties]], the [[Nationalist Republican Alliance]] (ARENA) and the [[Farabundo Martí National Liberation Front]] (FMLN) have tended to dominate elections. ARENA candidates won four consecutive presidential elections until the election of [[Mauricio Funes]] of the FMLN in March 2009. The FMLN Party is leftist in ideology, and is split between the dominant [[Marxist-Leninist]] faction in the legislature, and the [[Social liberalism|social liberal]] wing led by President Funes. However, the two-party dominance was broken after Nayib Bukele,a candidate from [[GANA]] won the [[2019 Salvadoran presidential election]].

Geographically, [[Departments of El Salvador|the departments]] of the Central region, especially the capital and the coastal regions, known as departamentos rojos, or red departments, are relatively Leftist. The departamentos azules, or blue departments in the east, western and highland regions are relatively conservative. The winner of the [[Salvadoran presidential election, 2014|2014 presidential election]], [[Salvador Sánchez Cerén]] belongs to the FMLN party. In the 2015 elections for mayors and members of the National Assembly, ARENA appeared to be the winner with tight control of the National Assembly.

El Salvador is a member of the [[United Nations]] and several of its specialized agencies, including the [[Organization of American States]], the [[Central American Parliament]], and the [[Central American Integration System]]. It actively participates in the Central American Security Commission, which seeks to promote regional arms control. El Salvador is a member of the [[World Trade Organization]] and is pursuing regional free trade agreements. An active participant in the [[Summits of the Americas|Summit of the Americas]] process, El Salvador chairs a working group on market access under the [[Free Trade Area of the Americas]] initiative.

In November, 1950 El Salvador helped the newly empowered [[14th Dalai Lama]] by supporting his [[Tibet]]an Government cabinet minister's telegram requesting an appeal before the [[United Nations General Assembly|General Assembly of the United Nations]] to stop the Communist [[China]]'s [[People's Liberation Army]]'s invasion of Tibet.

==Economy==
{{Main|Economy of El Salvador}}
[[File:El Salvador Export Treemap.jpg|thumb|upright=1.8|A proportional representation of El Salvador's exports]]
El Salvador's economy has been hampered at times by natural disasters such as earthquakes and hurricanes, by government policies that mandate large economic subsidies, and by official corruption. Subsidies became such a problem that in April 2012, the International Monetary Fund suspended a $750&nbsp;million loan to the central government. President Funes' chief of cabinet, Alex Segovia, acknowledged that the economy was at the "point of collapse".<ref>{{cite news |last1=Quintanilla |first1=Lourdes |title=FMI suspende acuerdo de préstamo con el país |url=http://www.laprensagrafica.com/economia/nacional/259909-fmi-suspende-acuerdo-de-prestamo-con-el-pais.html |access-date=17 March 2020 |work=La Prensa Grafica |date=26 April 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120702214809/http://www.laprensagrafica.com/economia/nacional/259909-fmi-suspende-acuerdo-de-prestamo-con-el-pais.html |archive-date=2 July 2012}}</ref>

Gross domestic product ([[Gross domestic product|GDP]]) in [[purchasing power parity]] in 2008 was estimated at US$25.895&nbsp;billion. The service sector is the largest component of GDP at 64.1%, followed by the industrial sector at 24.7% (2008 est.). Agriculture represents 11.2% of GDP (2010 est.) The GDP grew after 1996 at an annual rate that averaged 3.2% real growth. The government committed to free market initiatives, and the 2007 GDP's real growth rate was 4.7%.<ref>{{cite web |title=Gross Domestic Product, annual rates, main economic sectors |publisher=[[Banco Central de Reserva de El Salvador]] |url=http://www.bcr.gob.sv/ingles/estadisticas/sr_produccion.html |access-date=2007-11-17| archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20071107150307/http://www.bcr.gob.sv/ingles/estadisticas/sr_produccion.html| archive-date = 7 November 2007}}</ref>

In December 1999, net international reserves equalled US$1.8&nbsp;billion or roughly five months of imports. Having this hard currency buffer to work with, the Salvadoran government undertook a monetary integration plan beginning in January 2001 by which the U.S. dollar became legal tender alongside the [[Salvadoran colón]], and all formal accounting was done in U.S. dollars. Thus, the government has formally limited the implementing of open market monetary policies to influence short-term variables in the economy. With the adoption of the U.S. dollar, El Salvador lost control over monetary policy. Any counter-cyclical policy response to the downturn must be through fiscal policy, which is constrained by legislative requirements for a two-thirds majority to approve any international financing. As of September 2007, net [[Foreign exchange reserves|international reserves]] stood at $2.42&nbsp;billion.<ref name="tdfiyp" /><ref>{{cite web|title=Saldos a fin de año o mes|publisher=Banco Central de Reserva de El Salvador|language=es|url=http://www.bcr.gob.sv/estadisticas/Sector_externo/sectorexterno_reservasint_anual.html|access-date=2007-11-17|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071014022202/http://bcr.gob.sv/estadisticas/Sector_externo/sectorexterno_reservasint_anual.html|archive-date=14 October 2007}}</ref>

It has long been a challenge in El Salvador to develop new growth sectors for a more diversified economy. In the past, the country produced gold and silver,<ref>{{cite web |last1=Oancea |first1=Dan |title=Mining in Central America |url=http://magazine.mining.com/Issues/0901/MiningCentralAmerica.pdf |website=MINING.com |access-date=17 March 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110516031334/http://magazine.mining.com/Issues/0901/MiningCentralAmerica.pdf |archive-date=16 May 2011 |date=January 2009 |url-status=dead}}</ref> but recent attempts to reopen the mining sector, which were expected to add hundreds of millions of dollars to the local economy, collapsed after President Saca shut down the operations of [[Pacific Rim Mining Corporation]].  Nevertheless, according to the Central American Institute for Fiscal Studies (Instituto Centroamericano for Estudios Fiscales), the contribution of metallic mining was a minuscule 0.3% of the country's GDP between 2010 and 2015.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://icefi.org/noticias/estudio-sobre-mineria-metalica-en-triangulo-norte-se-presenta-en-el-salvador|title=Estudio sobre minería metálica en triángulo norte se presenta en El Salvador|date=7 April 2017}}</ref> Saca's decision although not lacking political motives, had strong support from local residents and grassroots movements in the country. President Funes later rejected a company's application for a further permit based on the risk of cyanide contamination on one of the country's main rivers.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://nacla.org/blog/2012/6/8/pacific-rim-ruling-threatens-el-salvador%25E2%2580%2599s-national-sovereignty|title=Pacific Rim Ruling Threatens El Salvador's National Sovereignty|website=NACLA}}</ref>

As with other former colonies, El Salvador was considered a mono-export economy (an economy that depended heavily on one type of export) for many years. During colonial times, El Salvador was a thriving exporter of [[Indigo dye|indigo]], but after the invention of synthetic dyes in the 19th century, the newly created modern state turned to [[coffee]] as the main export.

[[File:Fdpt18102006bmcha43c.jpg|thumb|[[San Miguel, El Salvador|San Miguel]] is an important economic centre of El Salvador and home to the "Carnival of San Miguel", one of the biggest festivals of entertainment and food in Central America.<ref name="Herrera-Sobek2012">{{cite book|first=Maria|last=Herrera-Sobek|title=Celebrating Latino Folklore|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=lY-tY62V1FIC&pg=PA459|date=31 July 2012|publisher=ABC-CLIO|isbn=978-0-313-34340-7|page=459}}</ref>]]
The government has sought to improve the collection of its current revenues, with a focus on indirect taxes. A 10% [[value-added tax]] (IVA in Spanish), implemented in September 1992, was raised to 13% in July 1995. Inflation has been steady and among the lowest in the region. Since 1997 inflation has averaged 3%, with recent years increasing to nearly 5%. As a result of the free trade agreements, from 2000 to 2006, total exports have grown 19% from $2.94&nbsp;billion to $3.51&nbsp;billion, and total imports have risen 54% from $4.95&nbsp;billion to $7.63&nbsp;billion. This has resulted in a 102% increase in the trade deficit, from $2.01&nbsp;billion to $4.12&nbsp;billion.<ref>{{cite web|title=Trade Balance, Annual and Monthly Accumulated|publisher=Banco Central de Reserva de El Salvador|url=http://www.bcr.gob.sv/ingles/estadisticas/se_balanzacom.html |access-date=2007-11-17|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071014112428/http://bcr.gob.sv/ingles/estadisticas/se_balanzacom.html|archive-date=14 October 2007}}</ref>

[[File:El Chorreron, San Fernando, El Salvador.jpg|thumb|upright|El Chorreron, El Salvador; tourism is the fastest-growing sector of the Salvadoran economy.]]

El Salvador has promoted an open trade and investment environment and has embarked on a wave of privatization extending to telecommunications, electricity distribution, banking, and pension funds. In late 2006, the government and the Millennium Challenge Corporation signed a five-year, $461&nbsp;million compact to stimulate economic growth and reduce poverty in the country's northern region, the primary conflict zone during the civil war, through investments in education, public services, enterprise development, and transportation infrastructure.

In 2006, El Salvador was the first country to ratify the Central America-Dominican Republic Free Trade Agreement (CAFTA) — negotiated by the five countries of Central America and the [[Dominican Republic]] — with the United States. CAFTA requires that the Salvadoran government adopt policies that foster [[free trade]]. CAFTA has bolstered exports of processed foods, sugar, and ethanol, and supported investment in the apparel sector, which faced Asian competition with the expiration of the [[Multi Fibre Arrangement]] in 2005. In anticipation of the declines in the apparel sector's competitiveness, the previous administration sought to diversify the economy by promoting the country as a regional distribution and logistics hub, and by promoting tourism investment through tax incentives.

===Remittances from abroad===
El Salvador leads the region in [[remittance]]s per capita, with inflows equivalent to nearly all export income; about a third of all households receive these financial inflows. Remittances from Salvadorans living and working in the United States, sent to family members in El Salvador, are a major source of foreign income and offset the substantial trade deficit of $4.12&nbsp;billion. Remittances have increased steadily in the last decade, and reached an all-time high of $3.32&nbsp;billion in 2006 (an increase of 17% over the previous year).<ref>{{cite web|title=Family Remittances|publisher=Banco Central de Reserva de El Salvador|url=http://www.bcr.gob.sv/ingles/estadisticas/se_remesas.html |access-date=2007-11-17|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071107112652/http://www.bcr.gob.sv/ingles/estadisticas/se_remesas.html|archive-date=7 November 2007}}</ref> approximately 16.2% of GDP.

Remittances have had positive and negative effects on El Salvador. In 2005, the number of people living in [[extreme poverty]] in El Salvador was 20%,<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.redsolidaria.gob.sv/content/view/677/46/1/1/|title=Objetivos de Desarrollo del Milenio|access-date=2007-05-23|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070527082755/http://www.redsolidaria.gob.sv/content/view/677/46/1/1/|archive-date=27 May 2007|language=es}}
<!-- see http://www.mh.gob.sv/portal/page/portal/PCC/Boletin2010/Bolet%EDn_Presupuestario_Octubre-Diciembre_20101.pdf for an update-->
</ref> according to a United Nations Development Program report. Without remittances, the number of Salvadorans living in extreme poverty would rise to 37%. While Salvadoran education levels have gone up, wage expectations have risen faster than either skills or productivity. For example, some Salvadorans are no longer willing to take jobs that pay them less than what they receive monthly from family members abroad. This has led to an influx of Hondurans and Nicaraguans who are willing to work for the prevailing wage. Also, the local propensity for consumption over investment has increased.

Money from remittances has increased prices for certain commodities such as real estate. With much higher wages, many Salvadorans abroad can afford higher prices for houses in El Salvador than local Salvadorans, and thus push up the prices that all Salvadorans must pay.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/05/13/AR2006051300879_pf.html|title=Money Earned in U.S. Pushes Up Prices in El Salvador|work=The Washington Post|date=2006-05-13|access-date=2010-05-02|first=N.C.|last= Aizenman}}</ref>[[File:World Trade Center San Salvador.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Torre Futura]] at [[World Trade Center San Salvador]]]]

===Official corruption and foreign investment===
In an analysis of ARENA's electoral defeat in 2009, the U.S. Embassy in San Salvador pointed to official corruption under the Saca administration as a significant reason for public rejection of continued ARENA government. According to a secret diplomatic cable made public by WikiLeaks, "While the Salvadoran public may be inured to self-serving behaviour by politicians, many in ARENA believe that the brazen manner in which Saca and his people are widely perceived to have used their positions for personal enrichment went beyond the pale. ARENA deputy Roberto d'Aubuisson, son of ARENA founder [[Roberto d'Aubuisson]], told [a U.S. diplomat] that Saca 'deliberately ignored' his Public Works Minister's government contract kickbacks scheme, even after the case was revealed in the press. Furthermore, considerable evidence exists, including from U.S. business sources, that the Saca administration pushed laws and selectively enforced regulations with the specific intent to benefit Saca family business interests."<ref>{{cite web |title=Reorganizing ARENA: The Partys Future After Avila's Defeat |url=https://wikileaks.org/plusd/cables/09SANSALVADOR947_a.html |website=WikiLeaks |publisher=United States Embassy San Salvador |access-date=17 March 2020 |date=6 October 2009}}</ref>

Subsequent policies under Funes administrations improved El Salvador to foreign investment, and the World Bank in 2014 rated El Salvador 109, a little better than Belize (118) and Nicaragua (119) in the World Bank's annual "[[Ease of doing business index|Ease of doing business]]" index.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.doingbusiness.org/rankings |title=Archived copy |access-date=2014-10-01 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150206025936/http://www.doingbusiness.org/rankings |archive-date=2015-02-06 }} Annual index, Doing Business 2014, World Bank.</ref>

As per Santander Trade, a Spanish think tank in foreign investment, "Foreign investment into El Salvador has been steadily growing during the last few years. In 2013, the influx of FDI increased. Nevertheless, El Salvador receives less FDI than other countries of Central America. The government has made little progress in terms of improving the business climate. In addition to this, the limited size of its domestic market, weak infrastructures and institutions, as well as the high level of criminality have been real obstacles to investors. However, El Salvador is the second most "business friendly" country in South America in terms of business taxation. It also has a young and skilled labour force and a strategic geographical position. The country's membership in the DR-CAFTA, as well as its reinforced integration to the C4 countries (producers of cotton) should lead to an increase of FDI."<ref>{{cite web|url=https://en.santandertrade.com/establish-overseas/el-salvador/investing-3|title=Foreign investment in El Salvador - Santandertrade.com|website=en.santandertrade.com}}</ref>

Foreign companies have lately resorted to arbitration in international trade tribunals in total disagreement with Salvadoran government policies. In 2008, El Salvador sought international arbitration against Italy's Enel Green Power, on behalf of Salvadoran state-owned electric companies for a geothermal project Enel had invested in. Four years later, Enel indicated it would seek arbitration against El Salvador, blaming the government for technical problems that prevent it from completing its investment.<ref>{{cite news |title=CEL a punto de ir a otro arbitraje |url=http://www.elsalvador.com/mwedh/nota/nota_completa.asp?idCat=47861&idArt=6919711 |access-date=17 March 2020 |work=elsalvador.com |date=21 May 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141129045947/http://www.elsalvador.com/mwedh/nota/nota_completa.asp?idCat=47861&idArt=6919711 |archive-date=29 November 2014}}</ref> The government came to its defence claiming that Art 109 of the constitution does not allow any government (regardless of the party they belong), to privatize the resources of the national soil (in this case geothermic energy).

A 2008 report by the [[United Nations Conference on Trade and Development]] <ref>{{cite web|url=http://unctad.org/en/docs/diaepcb200920_en.pdf]|title=UNCTD Report}}</ref> indicates that one third of the generation of electricity in El Salvador was publicly owned while two thirds was in American hands and other foreign ownership. It is only natural for a small, under-developed country like El Salvador to subsidize some of the resources for the vast majority of its poor population. In terms of how people perceived the levels of public corruption in 2014, El Salvador ranks 80 out of 175 countries as per the Corruption Perception Index.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.transparency.org/cpi2014/results,|title=How corrupt is your country?|first=Transparency International|last=e.V.|website=transparency.org}}</ref> El Salvador's rating compares relatively well with Panama (94 of 175) and Costa Rica (47 of 175).

===Tourism===

It was estimated that 1,394,000 international tourists visited El Salvador in 2014.Tourism contributed US$2970.1&nbsp;million to El Salvador's GDP in 2019.

Most North American and European tourists seek out El Salvador's beaches and nightlife. El Salvador's tourism landscape is slightly different from those of other Central American countries. Because of its geographic size and urbanization there are not many nature-themed tourist destinations such as ecotours or archaeological sites open to the public. According to the El Salvadoran newspaper ''[[El Diario De Hoy]]'', the top 10 attractions are: the coastal beaches, [[La Libertad, La Libertad|La Libertad]], Ruta Las Flores, [[Suchitoto]], Playa Las Flores in [[San Miguel, El Salvador|San Miguel]], La Palma, [[Santa Ana Volcano|Santa Ana]] (location of the country's highest volcano), [[Nahuizalco]], [[Apaneca]], [[Juayua]], and [[San Ignacio, Chalatenango|San Ignacio]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.elsalvador.com/mwedh/nota/nota_varias_fotos.asp?idCat=2907&idArt=1482342 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080223005240/http://www.elsalvador.com/mwedh/nota/nota_varias_fotos.asp?idCat=2907&idArt=1482342 |archive-date=2008-02-23 |title=Los 10 destinos turísticos más apetecidos |first=Milady |last=Cruz |date=2007-06-24|publisher=elsalvador.com |access-date=2010-05-02}}</ref>

Surfing is a natural tourism sector that has gained popularity in recent years as Salvadoran beaches have become increasingly popular. Surfers visit many beaches on the coast of La Libertad and the east end of El Salvador. The use of the U.S. dollar as Salvadoran currency and direct flights of 4 to 6 hours from most cities in the United States are factors that attract American tourists. Urbanization and [[Americanization]] of Salvadoran culture has led to the abundance of American-style malls, stores, and restaurants in the three main urban areas, especially greater San Salvador.

==Infrastructure==
The level of access [[Water supply and sanitation in El Salvador|to water supply and sanitation]] has been increased significantly. A 2015 conducted study by the University of North Carolina called El Salvador the country that has achieved the greatest progress in the world in terms of increased access to water supply and sanitation and the reduction of inequity in access between urban and rural areas.<ref>{{cite web|title=The WASH Performance Index Report|url=http://waterinstitute.unc.edu/wash-performance-index-report/|editor1=The Water Institute |editor2=University of North Carolina }}</ref> However, water resources are seriously polluted and a large part of the wastewater discharged into the environment without any treatment. Institutionally a single public institution is both de facto in charge of setting sector policy and of being the main service provider. Attempts at reforming and modernizing the sector through new laws have not borne fruit over the past 20 years.

The airport serving international flights in El Salvador is [[Monseñor Óscar Arnulfo Romero International Airport]]. This airport is located about {{convert|40|km|mi|abbr=on}} southeast of San Salvador.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.aeropuertoelsalvador.gob.sv/|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060213150000/http://www.aeropuertoelsalvador.gob.sv/|url-status=dead|archive-date=2006-02-13|title=CEPA – Aeropuerto Internacional de El Salvador|publisher=Aeropuertoelsalvador.gob.sv|access-date=2010-05-02}}</ref>

===Languages===
Castillian, also known as Spanish, is the official language and is spoken by virtually all inhabitants, although some indigenous people speak also their native tongues, such as [[Pipil language|Nawat]] and [[Poqomam language|Poqomam]]. [[Q'eqchi' language|Q'eqchi']] is spoken by immigrants of [[Guatemala]]n and [[Belize]]an indigenous people living in El Salvador.

Like other regions of Central and South America, Salvadoran use [[voseo]]. This refers to the use of "vos" as the second person pronoun, instead of "tú".The local Spanish [[vernacular]] is called ''[[Salvadoran Spanish|caliche]],'' which is considered informal.

The public education system in El Salvador is severely lacking in resources. Class sizes in public schools can be as large as 50 children per classroom. Salvadorans who can afford the cost often choose to send their children to private schools, which are regarded as being better-quality than public schools. Most private schools follow American, European or other advanced systems. Lower-income families are forced to rely on public education.<ref>{{cite web |title=AFFORDABLE NON-STATE SCHOOLS IN EL SALVADOR |url=https://www.r4d.org/wp-content/uploads/El-Salvador-Case-Study_Final-Version3_May24_2018-.pdf |website=www.r4d.org}}</ref>

Education in El Salvador is free through high school. After nine years of basic education (elementary–middle school), students have the option of a two-year high school or a three-year high school. A two-year high school prepares the student for transfer to a university. A three-year high school allows the student to graduate and enter the workforce in a vocational career, or to transfer to a university to further their education in their chosen field.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://web.stanford.edu/~hakuta/www/archives/syllabi/E_CLAD/sfusd_cult_03/nancy/new/educ.html|title=What's Education Like in El Salvador|website=web.stanford.edu|access-date=2018-01-29}}</ref>

Pulling from indigenous, colonial Spanish and African influences, a composite population was formed as a result of intermarrying between the natives, European settlers, and enslaved Africans. The Catholic Church plays an important role in the Salvadoran culture. Archbishop [[Óscar Romero]] is a national hero for his role in resisting human rights violations that were occurring in the lead-up to the Salvadoran Civil War.<ref name=Eaton>Eaton, Helen-May (1991). ''[http://scholars.wlu.ca/etd/116/ The impact of the Archbishop Óscar Romero's alliance with the struggle for liberation of the Salvadoran people: A discussion of church-state relations (El Salvador)]'' (M.A. thesis) Wilfrid Laurier University</ref> Significant foreign personalities in El Salvador were the Jesuit priests and professors [[Ignacio Ellacuría]], [[Ignacio Martín-Baró]], and [[Segundo Montes]], who were murdered in 1989 by the Salvadoran Army during the height of the civil war.

Painting, ceramics and textiles are the principal manual artistic mediums. Writers [[Francisco Gavidia]], [[Salarrué]] (Salvador Salazar Arrué), [[Claudia Lars]], [[Alfredo Espino]], [[Pedro Geoffroy Rivas]], [[Manlio Argueta]], [[José Roberto Cea]], and poet [[Roque Dalton]] are important writers from El Salvador. Notable 20th-century personages include the late filmmaker Baltasar Polio, female film director [[Patricia Chica]], artist [[Fernando Llort]], and [[caricaturist]] [[Toño Salazar]].

Among the more renowned representatives of the graphic arts are the painters [[Augusto Crespin]], [[Noe Canjura]], [[Carlos Cañas]], [[Giovanni Gil]], Julia Díaz, Mauricio Mejia, Maria Elena Palomo de Mejia, [[Camilo Minero]], Ricardo Carbonell, Roberto Huezo, Miguel Angel Cerna, (the painter and writer better known as MACLo), Esael Araujo, and many others.

One of El Salvador's notable dishes is the ''[[pupusa]]''. ''Pupusas'' are handmade corn tortillas (made of ''[[masa|masa de maíz]]'' or ''masa de arroz'', a maize or rice flour dough used in [[Latin American cuisine]]) stuffed with one or more of the following: cheese (usually a soft Salvadoran cheese such as ''[[quesillo]]'', similar to mozzarella), ''[[chicharrón]]'', or [[refried beans]]. Sometimes the filling is ''queso con loroco'' (cheese combined with ''[[loroco]]'', a vine flower bud native to Central America).<ref name="Elsalvador.com">{{cite web|url=http://www.elsalvador.com/noticias/2003/10/31/nacional/nacio7.html|title=Pobladores prehispánicos inventaron las pupusas|publisher=Elsalvador.com|date=2003-10-31|access-date=2010-05-02|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110503202216/http://www.elsalvador.com/noticias/2003/10/31/nacional/nacio7.html|archive-date=2011-05-03}}</ref> ''Pupusas revueltas'' are ''pupusas'' filled with beans, cheese and pork. There are also vegetarian options. Some adventurous restaurants even offer ''pupusas'' stuffed with shrimp or spinach. The name ''pupusa'' comes from the Pipil-Nahuatl word, ''pupushahua''. The origins of the ''pupusa'' are debated, although its presence in El Salvador is known to predate the arrival of the Spaniards.<ref name="Elsalvador.com" />

Two other typical Salvadoran dishes are ''yuca frita'' and ''panes con pollo''. ''Yuca frita'' is deep fried [[cassava]] root served with [[curtido]] (a pickled cabbage, onion and carrot topping) and pork rinds with ''pescaditas'' (fried baby sardines). Yuca is sometimes served boiled instead of fried. ''Pan con pollo/pavo'' (bread with chicken/turkey) are warm turkey or chicken-filled submarine sandwiches. The bird is marinated and then roasted with spices and hand-pulled. This sandwich is traditionally served with tomato and watercress along with cucumber, onion, lettuce, mayonnaise, and mustard.

One of El Salvador's typical breakfasts is fried plantain, usually served with cream. It is common in Salvadoran restaurants and homes, including those of immigrants to the United States. [[Alguashte]], a condiment made from dried, ground [[pepitas]], is commonly incorporated into savoury and sweet Salvadoran dishes. "''Maria Luisa''" is a dessert commonly found in El Salvador. It is a layered cake that is soaked in orange marmalade and sprinkled with powdered sugar. One of the most popular desserts is the cake ''Pastel de tres leches'' (Cake of three milks),  consisting of three types of milk: evaporated milk, condensed milk, and cream.

A popular drink that Salvadorans enjoy is ''[[horchata]]''. ''Horchata'' is most commonly made of the [[morro seed]] ground into a powder and added to milk or water, and sugar. ''Horchata'' is drank year-round, and can be drank at any time of day. It mostly is accompanied by a plate of ''pupusas'' or fried yuca. ''Horchata'' from El Salvador has a very distinct taste and is not to be confused with Mexican ''horchata'', which is rice-based. Coffee is also a common morning beverage.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.everyculture.com/Cr-Ga/El-Salvador.html|title=Culture of El Salvador – traditional, history, ''People'', clothing, women, beliefs, food, customs, family|publisher=everyculture.com}}</ref> Other popular drinks in El Salvador include e''nsalada'', a drink made of chopped fruit swimming in fruit juice, and ''Kolachampan'', a sugar cane-flavoured carbonated beverage.

===Music===
{{Main|Music of El Salvador}}
Traditional Salvadoran music is a mixture of indigenous, Spanish, and African influences. It includes religious songs (mostly used to celebrate Christmas and other holidays, especially feast days of the saints). Other musical repertoire consists of danza, pasillo, marcha and cancione which are composed of parading bands, street performances, or onstage dances, either in groups or paired. Satirical and rural lyrical themes are common. Traditional instruments used are the ''[[marimba]]'', ''tepehuaste'', flutes, drums, [[Güiro|scrapers]] and [[gourd]]s, as well as guitars among others. El Salvador's well known folk dance is known as ''[[Xuc]]'' which originated in [[Cojutepeque]], Cuscatlan. Caribbean, Colombian, and Mexican music has become customary listening radio and party in the country, especially boleros, cumbia, merengue, Latin pop, salsa, bachata, and reggaeton.

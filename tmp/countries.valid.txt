<section_title_start> etymology <section_title_end>
the definite origin of the name panama is unknown . there are several theory . one state that the country wa named after a commonly found specie of tree ( sterculia apetala , the panama tree ) . another state that the first settler arrived in panama in august , when butterfly are abundant , and that the name mean `` many butterfly '' in one or several of the amerindian language that were spoken in the territory prior to spanish colonization of the america . the most scientifically corroborated theory by panamanian linguist , state that the word is a [ of the kuna language ] word `` bannaba '' which mean `` distant '' or `` far away '' .
a commonly relayed legend in panama is that there wa a fishing village that bore the name `` panam '' , which purportedly meant `` an abundance of fish '' , when the spanish colonizer first landed in the area . the exact location of the village is unknown . the legend is usually corroborated by captain antonio tello de guzmn 's diary entry , who report landing at an unnamed village while exploring the pacific coast of panama in 1515 ; he only describes the village a a `` same small indigenous fishing town '' . in 1517 , don [ [ gaspar de espinosa , a spanish lieutenant , decided to settle a post in the same location guzmn described . in 1519 , pedrarias dvila decided to establish the spanish empire 's pacific port at the site . the new settlement replaced santa mara la antigua del darin , which had lost it function within the crown 's global plan after the spanish exploitation of the rich in the pacific began .
the official definition and origin of the name a promoted by panama 's ministry of education is the `` abundance of fish , tree and butterfly '' . this is the usual description given in social study textbook .
<section_title_start> history <section_title_end>
at the time of the arrival of the spanish in the 16th century , the known inhabitant of panama included the cueva people and the gran cocl tribe . these people have nearly disappeared , a they had no immunity from european infectious disease .
<section_title_start> pre-columbian period <section_title_end>
the isthmus of panama wa formed about three ; million year ago when the land bridge between north and south america finally became complete , and plant and animal gradually crossed it in both direction . the existence of the isthmus affected the dispersal of people , agriculture and technology throughout the american continent from the appearance of the first hunter and collector to the era of village and city .
the earliest discovered artifact of indigenous people of the america in panama include paleo-indian paleo-indian projectile point . later central panama wa home to some of the first pottery-making in the america , for example the culture at monagrillo ( archaeological site ) , which date back to 25001700 bc . these evolved into significant population best known through their spectacular burial ( dating to c. 500900 ad ) at the monagrillo ( archaeological site ) archaeological site , and their beautiful gran cocl style polychrome pottery . the monumental monolithic sculpture at the barriles ( chiriqui ) site are also important trace of these ancient isthmian culture .
before european arrived panama wa widely settled by chibchan , chocoan , and cueva people people . the largest group were the cueva ( whose specific language affiliation is poorly documented ) . the size of the indigenous people of the america population of the isthmus at the time of european colonization is uncertain . estimate range a high a two million people , but more recent study place that number closer to 200,000 . archaeological find and testimonial by early european explorer describe diverse native isthmian group exhibiting cultural variety and suggesting people developed by regular regional route of commerce .
when panama wa colonized , the indigenous people fled into the forest and nearby island . scholar believe that infectious disease wa the primary cause of the population decline of american native . the indigenous people had no acquired immunity to disease which had been chronic in eurasian population for century .
<section_title_start> conquest to 1799 <section_title_end>
rodrigo de bastidas sailed westward from venezuela in 1501 in search of gold , and became the first european to explore the isthmus of panama . a year later , christopher columbus visited the isthmus , and established a short-lived settlement in the darin province . vasco nez de balboa 's tortuous trek from the atlantic to the pacific in 1513 demonstrated that the isthmus wa indeed the path between the sea , and panama quickly became the crossroad and marketplace of spain 's empire in the new world . gold and silver were brought by ship from south america , hauled across the isthmus , and loaded aboard ship for spain . the route became known a the camino real , or royal road , although it wa more commonly known a camino de crux ( road of cross ) because of the number of gravesites along the way .
panama wa under spanish empire for almost 300 year ( 15381821 ) , and became part of the viceroyalty of peru , along with all other spanish possession in south america . from the outset , panamanian identity wa based on a sense of `` geographic destiny '' , and panamanian fortune fluctuated with the geopolitical importance of the isthmus . the colonial experience spawned panamanian nationalism and a racially complex and highly stratified society , the source of internal conflict that ran counter to the unifying force of nationalism .
in 1538 the real audiencia of panama wa established , initially with jurisdiction from nicaragua to cape horn , until the conquest of peru . a real audiencia wa a judicial district that functioned a an appeal court . each audiencia had an oidor ( spanish : hearer , a judge ) .
spanish authority had little control over much of the territory of panama . large section managed to resist conquest and missionization until very late in the colonial era . because of this , indigenous people of the area were often referred to a `` indios de guerra '' ( war indian ) who resisted spanish attempt to conquer them or missionize them . however , panama wa enormously important to spain strategically because it wa the easiest way to transship silver mined in peru to europe . silver cargo were landed at panama and then taken overland to portobelo , coln or nombre de dios , coln on the caribbean side of the isthmus for further shipment .
because of incomplete spanish control , the panama route wa vulnerable to attack from pirate ( mostly dutch and english ) , and from `` new world '' african called cimarron people ( panama ) who had freed themselves from enslavement and lived in commune or palenques around the camino real in panama 's interior , and on some of the island off panama 's pacific coast . one such famous community amounted to a small kingdom under bayano , which emerged in the 1552 to 1558 . sir francis drake 's famous raid on panama in 157273 and john oxenham 's crossing to the pacific ocean were aided by panama cimarron , and spanish authority were only able to bring them under control by making an alliance with them that guaranteed their freedom in exchange for military support in 1582.
the prosperity enjoyed during the first two century ( 15401740 ) while contributing to colonial growth ; the placing of extensive regional judicial authority ( real audiencia ) a part of it jurisdiction ; and the pivotal role it played at the height of the spanish empire  the first modern global empire  helped define a distinctive sense of autonomy and of regional or national identity within panama well before the rest of the colony .
the end of the encomienda system in azuero peninsula , however , sparked the conquest of veraguas in that same year . under the leadership of francisco vzquez , the region of veraguas passed into castilian rule in 1558 . in the newly conquered region , the old system of encomienda wa imposed . on the other hand , the panamanian movement for independence can be indirectly attributed to the abolition of the encomienda system in the azuero peninsula , set forth by the spanish crown , in 1558 because of repeated protest by local against the mistreatment of the native population . in it stead , a system of medium and smaller-sized landownership wa promoted , thus taking away the power from the large landowner and into the hand of medium and small-sized proprietor .
panama wa the site of the ill-fated darien scheme , which set up a kingdom of scotland colony in the region in 1698 . this failed for a number of reason , and the ensuing debt contributed to the act of union 1707 of england and scotland in 1707.
in 1671 , the privateer henry morgan , licensed by the english government , sacked and burned the city of panam viejo  the second most important city in the spanish new world at the time . in 1717 the viceroyalty of new granada ( northern south america ) wa created in response to other european trying to take spanish territory in the caribbean region . the isthmus of panama wa placed under it jurisdiction . however , the remoteness of new granada 's capital , santa fe de bogot ( the modern capital of colombia ) proved a greater obstacle than the spanish crown anticipated a the authority of new granada wa contested by the seniority , closer proximity , and previous tie to the viceroyalty of lima and even by panama 's own initiative . this uneasy relationship between panama and bogot would persist for century .
in 1744 , bishop francisco javier de luna victoria decastro established the college of san ignacio de loyola and on june 3 , 1749 , founded la real y pontificia universidad de san javier . by this time , however , panama 's importance and influence had become insignificant a spain 's power dwindled in europe and advance in navigation technique increasingly permitted ship to round cape horn in order to reach the pacific . while the panama route wa short it wa also labor-intensive and expensive because of the loading and unloading and laden-down trek required to get from the one coast to the other .
<section_title_start> 1800s <section_title_end>
a the spanish american war of independence were heating up all across latin america , panama city wa preparing for independence ; however , their plan were accelerated by the unilateral grito de la villa de los santos ( cry from the town of saint ) , issued on november 10 , 1821 , by the resident of azuero peninsula without backing from panama city to declare their separation from the spanish empire . in both veraguas and the capital this act wa met with disdain , although on differing level . to veraguas , it wa the ultimate act of treason , while to the capital , it wa seen a inefficient and irregular , and furthermore forced them to accelerate their plan .
nevertheless , the grito wa a sign , on the part of the resident of azuero , of their antagonism toward the independence movement in the capital . those in the capital region in turn regarded the azueran movement with contempt , since the separatist in panama city believed that their counterpart in azuero were fighting not only for independence from spain , but also for their right to self-rule apart from panama city once the spaniard were gone .
it wa seen a a risky move on the part of azuero , which lived in fear of colonel history of panama # jos de fbrega ( 17741841 ) . the colonel wa a staunch loyalist and had all of the isthmus ' military supply in his hand . they feared quick retaliation and swift retribution against the separatist .
what they had counted on , however , wa the influence of the separatist in the capital . ever since october 1821 , when the former governor general , juan de la cruz murgen , left the isthmus on a campaign in quito and left a colonel in charge , the separatist had been slowly converting fbrega to the separatist side . so , by november 10 , fbrega wa now a supporter of the independence movement . soon after the separatist declaration of los santos , fbrega convened every organization in the capital with separatist interest and formally declared the city 's support for independence . no military repercussion occurred because of skillful bribing of royalist troop .
<section_title_start> post-colonial panama <section_title_end>
in the 80 year following independence from spain , panama wa a subdivision of gran colombia , after voluntarily joining the country at the end of 1821.
the people of the isthmus made over 80 attempt to secede from colombia . she came close to success in 1831 , then again during the thousand day ' war of 18991902 , understood among indigenous panamanian a a struggle for land right under the leadership of victoriano lorenzo .
the u intent to influence the area , especially the panama canal 's construction and control , led to the separation of panama from colombia in 1903 and it establishment a a nation . when the senate of colombia rejected the hayherrn treaty on january 22 , 1903 , the united state decided to support and encourage the panamanian separatist movement
in november 1903 panama , tacitly supported by the united state , proclaimed it independence and concluded the haybunau-varilla treaty with the united state without the presence of a single panamanian . philippe bunau-varilla , a french engineer and lobbyist represented panama even though panama 's president and a delegation had arrived in new york to negotiate the treaty . the treaty wa quickly drafted and signed the night before the panamanian delegation arrived in washington . mr. bunau-varilla wa in the employ of the french canal company that had failed and wa now bankrupt .
the treaty granted right to the united state `` a if it were sovereign '' in a panama canal zone roughly wide and long . in that zone , the u would build a canal , then administer , fortify , and defend it `` in perpetuity '' .
in 1914 the united state completed the existing canal .
the strategic importance of the canal during world war ii caused the u to extensively fortify access , a discussed at panama during world war ii .
from 1903 to 1968 , panama wa a constitutional democracy dominated by a commercially oriented oligarchy . during the 1950s , the panamanian military began to challenge the oligarchy 's political hegemony . the early 1960s saw also the beginning of sustained pressure in panama for the renegotiation of the haybunau-varilla treaty , including riot that broke out in early 1964 , resulting in widespread looting and dozen of death , and the evacuation of the american embassy .
amid negotiation for the roblesjohnson treaty , panama held election in 1968 . the candidate were :
* dr. arnulfo aria madrid , unin nacional ( national union )
* antonio gonzlez revilla , people 's party ( panama ) ( christian democrat )
* engr . david samudio , alianza del pueblo ( people 's alliance ) who had the government 's support .
aria madrid wa declared the winner of election that were marked by violence and accusation of fraud against alianza del pueblo . on october 1 , 1968 , aria madrid took office a president of panama , promising to lead a government of `` national union '' that would end the reigning corruption and pave the way for a new panama . a week and a half later , on october 11 , 1968 , the national guard ( guardia nacional ) ousted aria and initiated the downward spiral that would culminate with the united state ' invasion in 1989 . aria , who had promised to respect the hierarchy of the national guard , broke the pact and started a large restructuring of the guard . to preserve the guard 's and his vested interest , lieutenant colonel omar torrijos herrera and major boris martnez commanded another military coup against a civilian government in panamanian republican history . ( the action wa reminiscent of the 1940s when strong man colonel jose remon removed three duly elected president . remon finally ran for president himself in 1952 . he controlled the national guard which abused the opposition during the campaign and even stole election box on election day . )
the military justified itself by declaring that aria madrid wa trying to install a dictatorship , and promised a return to constitutional rule . in the meantime , the guard began a series of populist measure that would gain support for the coup . among them were :
* price freezing on food , medicine and other good until january 31 , 1969
* rent level freeze
* legalization of the permanence of squatting family in borough surrounding the historic site of panama viejo
parallel to this , the military began a policy of repression against the opposition , who were labeled communist . the military appointed a provisional government junta that wa to arrange new election . however , the national guard would prove to be very reluctant to abandon power and soon began calling itself el gobierno revolucionario ( the revolutionary government ) .
<section_title_start> post-1970 <section_title_end>
under omar torrijos 's control , the military transformed the political and economic structure of the country , initiating massive coverage of social security service and expanding public education .
the constitution wa changed in 1972 . to reform the constitution , the military created a new organization , the assembly of corregimiento representative , which replaced the national assembly . the new assembly , also known a the poder popular ( power of the people ) , wa composed of 505 member selected by the military with no participation from political party , which the military had eliminated . the new constitution proclaimed omar torrijos a the maximum leader of the panamanian revolution , and conceded him unlimited power for six year , although , to keep a faade of constitutionality , demetrio b. lakas wa appointed president for the same period .
in 1981 , torrijos died in a plane crash . torrijos ' death altered the tone of panama 's political evolution . despite the 1983 constitutional amendment which proscribed a political role for the military , the panama defense force ( pdf ) , a they were then known , continued to dominate panamanian political life . by this time , general manuel noriega wa firmly in control of both the pdf and the civilian government .
in the 1984 election , the candidate were
* nicols ardito barletta vallarino , supported by the military in a union called unade
* arnulfo aria madrid , for the opposition union ado
* ex-general rubn daro paredes , who had been forced to an early retirement by noriega , running for partido nacionalista popular pnp ( `` popular nationalist party '' )
* carlos ivn ziga , running for partido accin popular ( papo ) meaning `` popular action party ''
barletta wa declared the winner of election that had been clearly won by aria . ardito barletta inherited a country in economic ruin and hugely indebted to the international monetary fund and the world bank . amid the economic crisis and barletta 's effort to calm the country 's creditor , street protest arose , and so did military repression .
meanwhile , noriega 's regime had fostered a well-hidden criminal economy that operated a a parallel source of income for the military and their ally , providing revenue from drug and money laundering . toward the end of the military dictatorship , a new wave of chinese migrant arrived on the isthmus in the hope of migrating to the united state . the smuggling of chinese became an enormous business , with revenue of up to 200 million dollar for noriega 's regime ( see mon 167 ) .
the military dictatorship , at that time supported by the united state , perpetrated the assassination and torture of more than one hundred panamanian and forced at least a hundred more dissident into exile . ( see zrate 15 ) . noriega also began playing a double role in central america under the supervision of the cia . while the contadora group conducted diplomatic effort to achieve peace in the region , noriega supplied nicaraguan contra and other guerrilla in the region with weapon and ammunition .
on june 6 , 1987 , the recently retired colonel roberto daz herrera , resentful that noriega had broken the agreed-upon `` torrijos plan '' of succession that would have made him the chief of the military after noriega , decided to denounce the regime . he revealed detail of electoral fraud , accused noriega of planning torrijos 's death and declared that torrijos had received 12 million dollar from the shah of iran for giving the exiled iranian leader asylum . he also accused noriega of the assassination by decapitation of then-opposition leader , dr. hugo spadafora .
on the night of june 9 , 1987 , the cruzada civilista ( `` civic crusade '' ) wa created and began organizing action of civil disobedience . the crusade called for a general strike . in response , the military suspended constitutional right and declared a state of emergency in the country . on july 10 , the civic crusade called for a massive demonstration that wa violently repressed by the `` doberman '' , the military 's special riot control unit . that day , later known a el viernes negro ( `` black friday '' ) , left six hundred people injured and another six hundred detained , many of whom were later tortured and raped .
united state president ronald reagan began a series of sanction against the military regime . the united state froze economic and military assistance to panama in the middle of 1987 in response to the domestic political crisis in panama and an attack on the u embassy . these sanction did little to overthrow noriega , but severely damaged panama 's economy . the sanction hit the panamanian population hard and caused the gross domestic product ( gdp ) to decline almost 25 percent between 1987 and 1989 ( see acosta n.p. ) .
on february 5 , 1988 , general manuel antonio noriega wa accused of drug trafficking by federal jury in tampa and miami .
in april 1988 , u president ronald reagan invoked the international emergency economic power act , freezing panamanian government asset in all u organization . in may 1989 panamanian voted overwhelmingly for the anti-noriega candidate . the noriega regime promptly annulled the election and embarked on a new round of repression .
<section_title_start> us invasion ( 1989 )  <section_title_end>
the united state government said operation just cause , which began on december 20 , 1989 , wa `` necessary to safeguard the life of u.s. citizen in panama , defend democracy and human right , combat drug trafficking , and secure the neutrality of the panama canal a required by the torrijoscarter treaty '' ( new york time , a transcript of president bush 's address n.p. ) . human right watch wrote in it 1989 report : `` washington turned a blind eye to abuse in panama for many year until concern over drug trafficking prompted indictment of the general [ noriega ] by two grand jury in florida in february 1988 '' . the u reported 23 serviceman killed and 324 wounded , with panamanian casualty estimated around 450 . described a a surgical maneuver , the action led to estimate of civilian death from 200 to 4,000 during the two week of armed activity . the united nation put the panamanian civilian death toll at 500 , the united state gave a figure of 202 civilian killed and former u attorney general ramsey clark estimated 4,000 death . it represented the largest united state military operation since the end of the vietnam war ( cajar pez 22 ) the number of u civilian ( and their dependent ) , who had worked for the panama canal authority and the u military , and were killed by the panamanian defense force , ha never been fully disclosed .
on december 29 , the united nation general assembly approved a resolution calling the intervention in panama a `` flagrant violation of international law and of the independence , sovereignty and territorial integrity of the state '' . a similar resolution wa vetoed in the united nation security council by the united state , the united kingdom , and france .
the urban population , many living below the poverty level , wa greatly affected by the 1989 intervention . a pointed out in 1995 by a un technical assistance mission to panama , the bombardment during the invasion displaced 20,000 people . the most heavily affected district wa impoverished el chorrillo , where several block of apartment were completely destroyed . el chorrillo had been built in the day of canal construction , a series of wooden barrack which easily caught fire under the united state attack . the economic damage caused by the intervention ha been estimated between 1.5 and 2 billion dollar . n.p . most panamanian supported the intervention .
<section_title_start> post-intervention era <section_title_end>
panama 's electoral tribunal moved quickly to restore civilian constitutional government , reinstated the result of the may 1989 election on december 27 , 1989 , and confirmed the victory of president guillermo endara and vice president guillermo ford and ricardo aria caldern .
during it five-year term , the often-fractious government struggled to meet the public 's high expectation . it new police force wa a major improvement over it predecessor but wa not fully able to deter crime . ernesto prez balladares wa sworn in a president on september 1 , 1994 , after an internationally monitored election campaign .
perez balladares ran a the candidate for a three-party coalition dominated by the democratic revolutionary party ( prd ) , the erstwhile political arm of military dictatorship . perez balladares worked skillfully during the campaign to rehabilitate the prd 's image , emphasizing the party 's populist torrijos root rather than it association with noriega . he won the election with only 33 percent of the vote when the major non-prd force splintered into competing faction . his administration carried out economic reform and often worked closely with the u on implementation of the canal treaty .
on september 1 , 1999 , mireya moscoso , the widow of former president arnulfo aria madrid , took office after defeating prd candidate martn torrijos , son of omar torrijos , in a free and fair election . during her administration , moscoso attempted to strengthen social program , especially for child and youth development , protection , and general welfare . moscoso 's administration successfully handled the panama canal transfer and wa effective in the administration of the canal .
the prd 's martin torrijos won the presidency and a legislative majority in the national assembly in 2004 . torrijos ran his campaign on a platform of , among other pledge , a `` zero tolerance '' for corruption , a problem endemic to the moscoso and perez balladares administration . after taking office , torrijos passed a number of law which made the government more transparent . he formed a national anti-corruption council whose member represented the highest level of government and civil society , labor organization , and religious leadership . in addition , many of his closest cabinet minister were non-political technocrat known for their support for the torrijos government 's anti-corruption aim . despite the torrijos administration 's public stance on corruption , many high-profile case , particularly involving political or business elite , were never acted upon .
conservative supermarket magnate ricardo martinelli wa elected to succeed martin torrijos with a landslide victory in the may 2009 presidential election . martinelli 's business credential drew voter worried by slowing growth due to the 2008 financial crisis . standing for the four-party opposition alliance for change , martinelli gained 60 percent of the vote , against 37 percent for the candidate of the governing left-wing democratic revolutionary party .
on may 4 , 2014 , juan carlos varela won the 2014 presidential election with over 39 percent of the vote , against the party of his former political partner ricardo martinelli , cambio democrtico , and their candidate jos domingo aria . he wa sworn in on july 1 , 2014 . on july 1 , 2019 laurentino cortizo took possession of the presidency .

it location on the isthmus of panama is strategic . by 2000 , panama controlled the panama canal which connects the atlantic ocean and the caribbean sea to the north of the pacific ocean . panama 's total area is .
the dominant feature of panama 's geography is the central spine of mountain and hill that form the continental divide . the divide doe not form part of the great mountain chain of north america , and only near the colombian border are there highland related to the andes system of south america . the spine that form the divide is the highly eroded arch of an uplift from the sea bottom , in which peak were formed by volcanic intrusion .
the mountain range of the divide is called the cordillera de talamanca near the costa rican border . farther east it becomes the serrana de tabasar , and the portion of it closer to the lower saddle of the isthmus , where the panama canal is located , is often called the sierra de veraguas . a a whole , the range between costa rica and the canal is generally referred to by geographer a the cordillera central , costa rica .
the highest point in the country is the volcn bar , which rise to . a nearly impenetrable jungle form the darin gap between panama and colombia where colombian guerrilla and drug dealer operate and sometimes take [ this and unrest , and forest protection ] movement , create a break in the [ [ pan-american highway , which otherwise form a complete road from alaska to patagonia .

<section_title_start> waterways <section_title_end>
nearly 500 river lace panama 's rugged landscape . mostly unnavigable , many originate a swift highland stream , meander in valley , and form coastal delta . however , the ro chagres ( chagres river ) , located in central panama , is one of the few wide river and a source of [ power . the central part of the river is dammed by the gatun dam ] and form [ [ gatun lake , an artificial lake that constitutes part of the panama canal . the lake wa created by the construction of the gatun dam across the ro chagres between 1907 and 1913 . once created , gatun lake wa the largest man-made lake in the world , and the dam wa the largest earth dam . the river drain northwest into the caribbean . the kampia and madden lake ( also filled from the ro chagres ) provide hydroelectricity for the area of the former canal zone .
the ro chepo , another source of hydroelectric power , is one of the more than 300 river emptying into the pacific . these pacific-oriented river are longer and slower-running than those on the caribbean side . their basin are also more extensive . one of the longest is the ro tuira , which flow into the golfo de san miguel and is the nation 's only river that is navigable by larger vessel .
<section_title_start> harbors <section_title_end>
the caribbean coastline is marked by several natural harbor . however , cristbal , at the caribbean terminus of the canal , had the only important port facility in the late 1980s . the numerous island of the archipilago de bocas del toro , near the beach of costa rica , provide an extensive natural roadstead and shield the banana port of almirante , bocas del toro . the more than 350 san blas island near colombia , are strung out over more than along the sheltered caribbean coastline .

the name is believed to have derived from the [ of the river bosna ( river ) bosna ] coursing through the bosnian heartland . according to [ [ philology anton mayer the name bosna could derive from illyrian language * '' bass-an-as '' ) , which would derive from the proto-indo-european root `` bos '' or `` bogh '' meaning `` the running water '' . according to english medievalist william miller ( historian ) the slavic settler in bosnia `` adapted the latin designation [ ... ] basante , to their own idiom by calling the stream bosna and themselves bosniaks [ ... ] '' .
the name herzegovina ( `` herzog 's [ land ] '' , from german word for `` duke '' ) originates from bosnian magnate stjepan vuki kosaa 's title , `` herceg ( herzog ) of hum and the coast '' ( 1448 ) . hum , formerly zachlumia , wa an early medieval principality that wa conquered by the bosnian banate in the first half of the 14th century . the region wa administered by the ottoman a the sanjak of herzegovina ( hersek ) within the bosnia eyalet up until the formation of the short-lived herzegovina eyalet in the 1830s , which remerged in the 1850s , after which the entity became commonly known a bosnia and herzegovina .
on initial proclamation of independence in 1992 , the country 's official name wa the republic of bosnia and herzegovina but following the 1995 dayton agreement and the new constitution that accompanied it the official name wa changed to bosnia and herzegovina .

<section_title_start> prehistory and antiquity <section_title_end>
bosnia ha been inhabited by human since at least the paleolithic , a one of the oldest cave painting wa found in badanj cave . major neolithic culture such a the butmir culture and kakanj culture were present along the river bosna ( river ) dated from c. 6230 bc  c. 4900 bc .
the bronze culture of the illyrian , an ethnic group with a distinct culture and art form , started to organize itself in today 's slovenia , croatia , bosnia and herzegovina , serbia , kosovo , montenegro and albania .
from 8th century bc , illyrian tribe evolved into kingdom . the earliest recorded kingdom in illyria ( a region in the western part of the balkan peninsula inhabited by the illyrian , a recorded in classical antiquity ) wa the enchele in the 8th century bc . the era in which we observe other illyrian kingdom begin approximately at 400 bc and end at 167 bc . the autariatae under pleurias ( 337 bc ) were considered to have been a kingdom . the kingdom of the ardiaei ( originally a tribe from the neretva valley region ) began at 230 bc and ended at 167 bc . the most notable illyrian kingdom and dynasty were those of bardyllis of the dardani and of agron of the ardiaei who created the last and best-known illyrian kingdom . agron ruled over the ardiaei and had extended his rule to other tribe a well .
from the 7th century bc , bronze wa replaced by iron , after which only jewelry and art object were still made out of bronze . illyrian tribe , under the influence of hallstatt culture to the north , formed regional center that were slightly different . part of central bosnia were inhabited by daesitiates tribe most commonly associated with central bosnian cultural group . iron age glasinac culture is associated with autariatae tribe .
a very important role in their life wa the cult of the dead , which is seen in their careful burial and burial ceremony , a well a the richness of their burial site . in northern part , there wa a long tradition of cremation and burial in shallow graf , while in the south the dead were buried in large stone or earth tumulus ( natively called gromile ) that in herzegovina were reaching monumental size , more than 50 m wide and 5 m high . japodian tribe had an affinity to decoration ( heavy , oversized necklace out of yellow , blue or white glass paste , and large bronze fibula ( brooch ) , a well a spiral bracelet , diadem and helmet out of bronze foil ) .
in the 4th century bc , the first invasion of celt is recorded . they brought the technique of the potter 's wheel , new type of fibula and different bronze and iron belt . they only passed on their way to greece , so their influence in bosnia and herzegovina is negligible . celtic migration displaced many illyrian tribe from their former land , but some celtic and illyrian tribe mixed . concrete historical evidence for this period is scarce , but overall it appears the region wa populated by a number of different people speaking distinct language .
in the neretva delta in the south , there were important hellenistic period influence of the illyrian daorson tribe . their capital wa daorson in oanii near stolac . daorson in the 4th century bc wa surrounded by megalithic , 5 m high stonewalls ( a large a those of mycenae in greece ) , composed of large trapezoid stone block . daors made unique bronze coin and sculpture .
conflict between the illyrian and ancient rome started in 229 ; bc , but rome did not complete it annexation of the region until ad ; 9 . it wa precisely in modern-day bosnia and herzegovina that rome fought one of the most difficult battle in it history since the punic war , a described by the roman historian suetonius . this wa the roman campaign against illyricum ( roman province ) , known a bellum batonianum . the conflict arose after an attempt to recruit illyrian , and a revolt spanned for four year ( 69 ad ) , after which they were subdued . in the roman period , latin-speaking settler from the entire roman empire settled among the illyrian , and roman soldier were encouraged to retire in the region .
following the split of the empire between 337 and 395 ad , dalmatia and pannonia became part of the western roman empire . the region wa conquered by the ostrogoth in 455 ad . it subsequently changed hand between the alans and the hun . by the 6th century , emperor justinian i had reconquered the area for the byzantine empire . slav overwhelmed the balkan in the 6th and 7th century . illyrian cultural trait were adopted by the south slav , a evidenced in certain custom and tradition , placenames , etc .
<section_title_start>  middle age  <section_title_end>
the early slav raided the western balkan , including bosnia , in the 6th and early 7th century ( amid the migration period ) , and were composed of small tribal unit drawn from a single slavic confederation known to the byzantine empire a the sclaveni ( whilst the related ante ( people ) , roughly speaking , colonized the eastern portion of the balkan ) .
tribe recorded by the ethnonyms of `` serb '' and `` croat '' are described a a second , latter , migration of different people during the second quarter of the 7th century who do not seem to have been particularly numerous ; these early `` serb '' and `` croat '' tribe , whose exact identity is subject to scholarly debate , came to predominate over the slav in the neighbouring region . the bulk of bosnia proper , however , appears to have been a territory between serb and croat rule and is not enumerated a one of the region settled by those tribe .
bosnia is first mentioned a a land ( horion bosona ) in byzantine emperor constantine porphyrogenitus ' de administrando imperio in the mid 10th century , at the end of a chapter ( chap . 32 ) entitled of the serb and the country in which they now dwell . this ha been scholarly interpreted in several way and used especially by the serb national ideologist to prove bosnia a originally a `` serb '' land . other scholar have asserted the inclusion of bosnia into chapter 32 to merely be the result of serbian grand duke aslav 's temporary rule over bosnia at the time , while also pointing out porphyrogenitus doe not say anywhere explicitly that bosnia is a `` serb land '' . in fact , the very translation of the critical sentence where the word bosona ( bosnia ) appears is subject to varying interpretation .
in time , bosnia formed a unit under it own ruler , who called himself bosnian . bosnia , along with other territory , became part of duklja in the 11th century , although it retained it own nobility and institution .
in the high middle age political circumstance led to the area being contested between the kingdom of hungary and the byzantine empire . following another shift of power between the two in the early 12th century , bosnia found itself outside the control of both and emerged a the banate of bosnia ( under the rule of local ban ( title ) ) . the first bosnian ban known by name wa ban bori . the second wa ban kulin whose rule marked the start of a controversy involving the bosnian church  considered heretical by the roman catholic church . in response to hungarian attempt to use church politics regarding the issue a a way to reclaim sovereignty over bosnia , kulin held a council of local church leader to renounce the heresy and embraced catholicism in 1203 . despite this , hungarian ambition remained unchanged long after kulin 's death in 1204 , waning only after an unsuccessful invasion in 1254 . during this time the population wa called dobri bonjani ( `` good bosnians '' ) . the name serb and croat , though occasionally appearing in peripheral area , were not used in bosnia proper .
bosnian history from then until the early 14th century wa marked by a power struggle between the ubi family and kotromani dynasty family . this conflict came to an end in 1322 , when stephen ii , ban of bosnia became ban . by the time of his death in 1353 , he wa successful in annexing territory to the north and west , a well a zahumlje and part of dalmatia . he wa succeeded by his ambitious nephew tvrtko i of bosnia who , following a prolonged struggle with nobility and inter-family strife , gained full control of the country in 1367 . by the year 1377 , bosnia wa elevated into a kingdom with the coronation of tvrtko a the first list of ruler of bosnia in mile near visoko during the middle age in the bosnian heartland .
following his death in 1391 however , bosnia fell into a long period of decline . the ottoman empire had started it ottoman war in europe and posed a major threat to the balkan throughout the first half of the 15th century . finally , after decade of political and social instability , the kingdom of bosnia ceased to exist in 1463 after it conquest by the ottoman empire .
<section_title_start>  ottoman empire  <section_title_end>
the ottoman conquest of bosnia marked a new era in the country 's history and introduced drastic change in the political and cultural landscape . the ottoman incorporating bosnia a an integral province of the ottoman empire with it historical name and territorial integrity .
within bosnia the ottoman introduced a number of key change in the territory 's socio-political administration ; including a new landholding system , a reorganization of administrative unit , and a complex system of social differentiation by class and religious affiliation .
the four century of ottoman rule also had a drastic impact on bosnia 's population make-up , which changed several time a a result of the empire 's conquest , frequent war with european power , forced and economic migration , and epidemic . a native slavic-speaking muslim community emerged and eventually became the largest of the ethno-religious group due to lack of strong christian church organization and continuous rivalry between the orthodox and catholic church , while the indigenous bosnian church disappeared altogether ( ostensibly by conversion of it member to islam ) . the ottoman referred to them a kristianlar while the orthodox and catholic were called gebir or kafir , meaning `` unbeliever '' . the bosnian franciscan ( and the catholic population a a whole ) were protected by official imperial decree and in accordance and full extent of ottoman law , however in effect , these often merely affected arbitrary rule and behavior of powerful local elite .
a the ottoman empire continued their rule in the balkan ( rumelia ) , bosnia wa somewhat relieved of the pressure of being a frontier province , and experienced a period of general welfare . a number of city , such a sarajevo and mostar , were established and grew into regional center of trade and urban culture and were then visited by ottoman empire traveler evliya elebi in 1648 . within these city , various ottoman sultan financed the construction of many work of architecture of bosnia and herzegovina such a the country 's first library in sarajevo , madrasa , a school of sufi philosophy , and a clock tower ( sahat kula ) , bridge such a the stari most , the emperor 's mosque and the gazi husrev-beg mosque .
furthermore , several bosnian muslim played influential role in the ottoman empire 's cultural and political history during this time . bosnian recruit formed a large component of the ottoman rank in the battle of battle of mohcs and battle of krbava field , while numerous other bosnians rose through the rank of the ottoman military to occupy the highest position of power in the empire , including admiral such a matrak nasuh ; general such a isa-beg ishakovi , gazi husrev-beg and telli hasan pasha and sar sleyman pasha ; administrator such a ferhad pasha sokolovi and osman gradaevi ; and grand vizier such a the influential sokollu mehmed pasha and damat ibrahim pasha . some bosnians emerged a sufism mystic , scholar such a muhamed hevaji uskufi bosnevi , ali dabi ; and poet in the turkish language , albanian language , arabic , and persian language .
however , by the late 17th century the empire 's military misfortune caught up with the country , and the end of the great turkish war with the treaty of karlowitz in 1699 again made bosnia the empire 's westernmost province . the 18th century wa marked by further military failure , numerous revolt within bosnia , and several outburst of plague .
the porte 's effort at modernizing the ottoman state were met with distrust growing to hostility in bosnia , where local aristocrat stood to lose much through the proposed tanzimat reform . this , combined with frustration over territorial , political concession in the north-east , and the plight of slav muslim refugee arriving from the sanjak of smederevo into bosnia eyalet , culminated in a partially unsuccessful revolt by husein gradaevi , who endorsed a bosnia eyalet autonomous from the authoritarian rule of the ottoman sultan mahmud ii , who persecuted , executed and abolished the janissary and reduced the role of autonomous pasha in rumelia . mahmud ii sent his grand vizier to subdue bosnia eyalet and succeeded only with the reluctant assistance of ali pasha rizvanbegovi . related rebellion were extinguished by 1850 , but the situation continued to deteriorate .
new nationalist movement appeared in bosnia by the middle of the 19th century . bolstered by serbia 's breakaway from the ottoman empire in the early 19th century , serbian nationalist began making contact and sending nationalist propaganda claiming bosnia a a serbian province . in the neighboring habsburg empire across the ottoman border , croatian nationalist made similar claim about bosnia a a croatian province . the rise of these competing movement marked the beginning of nationalist politics in bosnia , which continued to grow in the rest of the 19th and 20th century .
agrarian unrest eventually sparked the herzegovina uprising ( 18751877 ) , a widespread peasant uprising , in 1875 . the conflict rapidly spread and came to involve several balkan state and great power , a situation that led to the congress of berlin and the treaty of berlin ( 1878 ) in 1878.
<section_title_start>  austro-hungarian empire  <section_title_end>
at the congress of berlin in 1878 , the austria-hungary austro-hungarian foreign minister gyula andrssy obtained the occupation and administration of bosnia and herzegovina , and he also obtained the right to station garrison in the sanjak of novi pazar , which would remain under ottoman empire administration until 1908 , when the austro-hungarian troop withdrew from the sanjak .
although austro-hungarian official quickly came to an agreement with bosnians , tension remained and a mass emigration of bosnians occurred . however , a state of relative stability wa reached soon enough and austro-hungarian authority were able to embark on a number of social and administrative reform they intended would make bosnia and herzegovina into a `` model '' colony .
habsburg rule had several key concern in bosnia . it tried to dissipate the south slav nationalism by disputing the earlier serb and croat claim to bosnia and encouraging identification of bosnian or bosniaks identity . habsburg rule also tried to provide for modernisation by codifying law , introducing new political institution , and establishing and expanding industry .
austriahungary began to plan annexation of bosnia , but due to international dispute the issue wa not resolved until the annexation crisis of 1908 . several external matter affected status of bosnia and it relationship with austriahungary . may coup ( serbia ) occurred in serbia in 1903 , which brought a radical anti-austrian government into power in belgrade . then in 1908 , the revolt in the ottoman empire raised concern the istanbul government might seek the outright return of bosnia-herzegovina . these factor caused the austro-hungarian government to seek a permanent resolution of the bosnian question sooner , rather than later .
taking advantage of turmoil in the ottoman empire , austro-hungarian diplomacy tried to obtain provisional russian approval for change over the status of bosnia herzegovina and published the annexation proclamation on 6 october 1908 . despite international objection to the austro-hungarian annexation , russian and their client state , serbia , were compelled to accept the austrian-hungarian annexation of bosnia herzegovina in march 1909.
in 1910 , habsburg emperor franz joseph proclaimed the first constitution in bosnia , which led to relaxation of earlier law , election and formation of the bosnian parliament , and growth of new political life .
on 28 june 1914 , a yugoslav nationalist youth named gavrilo princip , a member of the secret serbian-supported movement , young bosnia , assassination of archduke franz ferdinand the heir to the austro-hungarian throne , archduke franz ferdinand of austria , in sarajevoan event that wa the spark that set off world war i . at the end of the war , the bosniaks had lost more men per caput than any other ethnic group in the habsburg empire whilst serving in the bosnian-herzegovinian infantry ( known a bosniaken ) of the austro-hungarian army . nonetheless , bosnia and herzegovina a a whole managed to escape the conflict relatively unscathed .
the austro-hungarian authority established an auxiliary militia known a the schutzkorps with a moot role in the empire 's policy of anti-serb sentiment anti-serb repression . schutzkorps , predominantly recruited among the muslim ( bosniak ) population , were tasked with hunting down rebel serb ( the chetniks and komitadji ) and became known for their persecution of serb particularly in serb populated area of eastern bosnia , where they partly retaliated against serbian chetniks who in fall 1914 had carried out attack against the muslim population in the area . the proceeding of the austro-hungarian authority led to around 5,500 citizen of serb ethnicity in bosnia and herzegovina being arrested , and between 700 and 2,200 died in prison while 460 were executed . around 5,200 serb family were forcibly expelled from bosnia and herzegovina .
<section_title_start>  kingdom of yugoslavia  <section_title_end>
following world war i , bosnia and herzegovina joined the south slav kingdom of yugoslavia kingdom of serb , croat and slovene ( soon renamed yugoslavia ) . political life in bosnia at this time wa marked by two major trend : social and economic unrest over distribution ( economics ) , and formation of several political party that frequently changed coalition and alliance with party in other yugoslav region .
the dominant ideological conflict of the yugoslav state , between croatian regionalism and serbian centralization , wa approached differently by bosnia 's major ethnic group and wa dependent on the overall political atmosphere . the political reform brought about in the newly established yugoslavian kingdom saw few benefit for the bosniaks ; according to the 1910 final census of land ownership and population according to religious affiliation conducted in austro-hungary , muslim ( bosniaks ) owned 91.1 % , orthodox serbian owned 6.0 % , croatian catholic owned 2.6 % and others , 0.3 % of the property . following the reform bosnian muslim were dispossessed of a total of 1,175,305 hectare of agricultural and forest land .
although the initial split of the country into 33 oblasts erased the presence of traditional geographic entity from the map , the effort of bosnian politician such a mehmed spaho ensured the six oblasts carved up from bosnia and herzegovina corresponded to the six sanjaks from ottoman time and , thus , matched the country 's traditional boundary a a whole .
the establishment of the kingdom of yugoslavia in 1929 , however , brought the redrawing of administrative region into kingdom of yugoslavia # subdivision or banovina ( region ) that purposely avoided all historical and ethnic line , removing any trace of a bosnian entity . serbo-croat tension over the structuring of the yugoslav state continued , with the concept of a separate bosnian division receiving little or no consideration .
the cvetkovimaek agreement cvetkovi-maek agreement that created the banovina of croatia in 1939 encouraged what wa essentially a partition of bosnia and herzegovina between croatia and serbia . however the rising threat of adolf hitler 's nazi germany forced yugoslav politician to shift their attention . following a period that saw attempt at appeasement , the signing of the tripartite pact , and a yugoslav coup d'tat coup d'tat , yugoslavia wa finally invaded by germany on 6 april 1941.
<section_title_start> world war ii ( 194145 )  <section_title_end>
once the kingdom of yugoslavia wa conquered by german force in world war ii , all of bosnia wa ceded to the nazi puppet regime , the independent state of croatia ( ndh ) led by the ustae . the ndh leader embarked on a genocide of serb in the independent state of croatia of serb , jew , romani people a well a dissident croat , and , later , josip broz tito 's yugoslav partisan by setting up a number of jasenovac concentration camp . the regime systematically and brutally massacred serb in village in the countryside , using a variety of tool . the scale of the violence meant that approximately every sixth serb living in bosnia-herzegovina wa the victim of a massacre and virtually every serb had a family member that wa killed in the war , mostly by the ustae . the experience had a profound impact in the collective memory of serb in croatia and bosnia . an estimated 209,000 serb or 16.9 % of it bosnia population were killed on the territory of bosniaherzegovina during the war .
the ustae recognized both roman catholicism and islam a the national religion , but held the position eastern orthodox church , a a symbol of serbian identity , wa their greatest foe . although croat were by far the largest ethnic group to constitute the ustae , the vice president of the ndh and leader of the yugoslav muslim organization dafer kulenovi wa a muslim , and muslim ( bosniaks ) in total constituted nearly 12 % of the ustae military and civil service authority .
many serb themselves took up arm and joined the chetniks , a serb nationalist movement with the aim of establishing an ethnically homogeneous 'greater serbian ' state within the kingdom of yugoslavia . the chetniks , in turn , persecuted and killed a large number of non-serbs , communist serb and communist sympathizer , with the muslim population of bosnia , herzegovina and sandak being a primary target . once captured , muslim villager were systematically massacred by the chetniks . of the 75,000 muslim who lost their life in bosnia and herzegovina during the war , approximately 30,000 ( mostly civilian ) were killed by the chetniks . between 64,000 and 79,000 bosnian croat were killed between april 1941 to may 1945 . of these , about 18,000 were killed by the chetniks .
a percentage of muslim served in nazi 13th waffen mountain division of the s handschar ( 1st croatian ) waffen-ss unit . these unit were responsible for massacre of serb in northwest and eastern bosnia , most notably in vlasenica . on 12 october 1941 , a group of 108 prominent sarajevan muslim signed the resolution of sarajevo muslim by which they condemned the persecution of serb organized by the ustae , made distinction between muslim who participated in such persecution and the muslim population a a whole , presented information about the persecution of muslim by serb , and requested security for all citizen of the country , regardless of their identity .
starting in 1941 , yugoslav communist under the leadership of josip broz tito organized their own multi-ethnic resistance group , the yugoslav partisan , who fought against both axis and chetnik force . on 29 november 1943 the anti-fascist council for the national liberation of yugoslavia with tito at it helm held a founding conference in jajce where bosnia and herzegovina wa reestablished a a republic within the yugoslavian federation in it habsburg border . during the entire course of the wwii in yugoslavia , 64.1 % of all bosnian partisan were serb , 23 % were muslim and 8.8 % croat .
military success eventually prompted the ally to support the partisan , resulting in the successful maclean mission , but tito declined their offer to help and relied on his own force instead . all the major military offensive by the antifascist movement of yugoslavia against nazi and their local supporter were conducted in bosniaherzegovina and it people bore the brunt of fighting . more than 300,000 people died in bosnia and herzegovina in world war ii . at the end of the war the establishment of the socialist federal republic of yugoslavia , with the 1946 yugoslav constitution , officially made bosnia and herzegovina one of six constituent republic in the new state .
<section_title_start> socialist federative republic of yugoslavia ( 19451992 )  <section_title_end>
due to it central geographic position within the yugoslavian federation , post-war bosnia wa selected a a base for the development of the military defense industry . this contributed to a large concentration of arm and military personnel in bosnia ; a significant factor in bosnian war the war that followed the break-up of yugoslavia in the 1990s . however , bosnia 's existence within yugoslavia , for the large part , wa relatively peaceful and very prosperous , with high employment , a strong industrial and export oriented economy , a good education system and social and medical security for every citizen ( of bosnia and herzegovina ) . several international corporation operated in bosnia  volkswagen a part of ta ( car factory in sarajevo , from 1972 ) , coca-cola ( from 1975 ) , skf sweden ( from 1967 ) , marlboro ( cigarette ) , ( a tobacco factory in sarajevo ) , and holiday inn hotel . sarajevo wa the site of the 1984 winter olympics .
during the 1950s and 1960s bosnia wa a political backwater of the republic of yugoslavia . in the 1970s a strong bosnian political elite arose , fueled in part by tito 's leadership in the non-aligned movement and bosnians serving in yugoslavia 's diplomatic corp . while working within the socialist system , politician such a demal bijedi , branko mikuli and hamdija pozderac reinforced and protected the sovereignty of bosnia and herzegovina . their effort proved key during the turbulent period following tito 's death in 1980 , and are today considered some of the early step towards bosnian independence . however , the republic did not escape the increasingly nationalistic climate of the time . with the fall of communism and the start of the break-up of yugoslavia , doctrine of tolerance began to lose it potency , creating an opportunity for nationalist element in the society to spread their influence .
<section_title_start> bosnian war ( 19921995 )  <section_title_end>
on 18 november 1990 , multi-party parliamentary election were held throughout bosnia and herzegovina . a second round followed on 25 november , resulting in a national assembly where communist power wa replaced by a coalition of three ethnically-based party . following slovenia and croatia 's declaration of independence from yugoslavia , a significant split developed among the resident of bosnia and herzegovina on the issue of whether to remain within yugoslavia ( overwhelmingly favored by serb ) or seek independence ( overwhelmingly favored by bosniaks and croat ) .
the serb member of parliament , consisting mainly of the serbian democratic party ( bosnia and herzegovina ) member , abandoned the central parliament in sarajevo , and formed the national assembly of the republika srpska on 24 october 1991 , which marked the end of the tri-ethnic coalition that governed after the election in 1990 . this assembly established the serbian republic of bosnia and herzegovina in part of the territory of bosnia and herzegovina on 9 january 1992 . it wa renamed republika srpska ( 1992 & ndash ; 95 ) in august 1992 . on 18 november 1991 , the party branch in bosnia and herzegovina of the ruling party in the republic of croatia , the croatian democratic union ( hdz ) , proclaimed the existence of the croatian republic of herzeg-bosnia croatian community of herzeg-bosnia in a separate part of the territory of bosnia and herzegovina with the croatian defence council ( hvo ) a it military branch . it went unrecognized by the government of bosnia and herzegovina , which declared it illegal .
a declaration of the sovereignty of bosnia and herzegovina on 15 october 1991 wa followed by a referendum for independence on 29 february/1 march 1992 , which wa boycotted by the great majority of serb . the turnout in the independence referendum wa 63.4 percent and 99.7 percent of voter voted for independence . bosnia and herzegovina declared independence on 3 march 1992 and received international recognition the following month on 6 april 1992 . the republic of bosnia and herzegovina wa admitted a a member state of the united nation on 22 may 1992 . serbian leader slobodan miloevi and croatian leader franjo tuman are believed to have agreed on a partition of bosnia and herzegovina in march 1991 , with the aim of establishing greater serbia and greater croatia .
following bosnia and herzegovina 's declaration of independence , bosnian serb militia mobilized in different part of the country . government force were poorly equipped and unprepared for the war . international recognition of bosnia and herzegovina increased diplomatic pressure for the yugoslav people 's army ( jna ) to withdraw from the republic 's territory , which they officially did in june 1992 . the bosnian serb member of the jna simply changed insignia , formed the army of republika srpska ( vrs ) , and continued fighting . armed and equipped from jna stockpile in bosnia , supported by volunteer and various paramilitary force from serbia , and receiving extensive humanitarian , logistical and financial support from the serbia and montenegro , republika srpska 's offensive in 1992 managed to place much of the country under it control . the bosnian serb advance wa accompanied by the ethnic cleansing of bosniaks and bosnian croat from vrs-controlled area . dozen of concentration camp were established in which inmate were subjected to violence and abuse , including rape . the ethnic cleansing culminated in the srebrenica massacre of more than 8,000 bosniak men and boy in july 1995 , which wa ruled to have been a genocide by the icty . bosniak and bosnian croat force also committed war crime against civilian from different ethnic group , though on a smaller scale . most of the bosniak and croat atrocity were committed during the bosniak-croat war , a sub-conflict of the bosnian war that pitted the army of the federation of bosnia and herzegovina ( arbih ) against the hvo . the bosniak-croat conflict ended in march 1994 , with the signing of the washington agreement , leading to the creation of a joint bosniak-croat federation of bosnia and herzegovina , which amalgamated hvo-held territory with that held by the arbih .

on 4 february 2014 , the protest against the government of the federation of bosnia and herzegovina , one of the country 's two entity , dubbed the bosnian spring , the name being taken from the arab spring , began in the northern town of tuzla . worker from several factory that had been privatised and had gone bankrupt united to demand action over job , and unpaid salary and pension . soon protest spread to the rest of the federation , with violent clash reported in close to 20 town , the biggest of which were sarajevo , zenica , mostar , biha , brko and tuzla . the bosnian news medium reported hundred of people had been injured during the protest , including dozen of police officer , with burst of violence in sarajevo , in the northern city of tuzla , in mostar in the south , and in zenica in central bosnia . the same level of unrest or activism did not occur in the republika srpska , but hundred of people also gathered in support of protest in the town of banja luka against it separate government .
the protest marked the largest outbreak of public anger over high unemployment and two decade of political inertia in the country since the end of the bosnian war in 1995.

<section_title_start>  etymology  <section_title_end>
the name `` zimbabwe '' stem from a shona language term for great zimbabwe , an ancient city in the country 's south-east whose remains are now a protected site . two different theory address the origin of the word . many source hold that `` zimbabwe '' derives from dzimba-dza-mabwe , translated from the karanga dialect of shona a `` house of stone '' ( dzimba = plural of imba , `` house '' ; mabwe = plural of bwe , `` stone '' ) . the karanga-speaking shona people live around great zimbabwe in the modern-day province of zimbabwe of masvingo province . archaeologist peter garlake claim that `` zimbabwe '' represents a contracted form of dzimba-hwe , which mean `` venerated house '' in the zezuru dialect of shona and usually reference chief ' house or graf .
zimbabwe wa formerly known a southern rhodesia ( 1898 ) , rhodesia ( 1965 ) , and zimbabwe rhodesia ( 1979 ) . the first recorded use of `` zimbabwe '' a a term of national reference date from 1960 a a coinage by the black nationalist michael mawema , whose zimbabwe national party became the first to officially use the name in 1961 . the term `` rhodesia '' derived from the surname of cecil rhodes , the primary instigator of british colonisation of the territory during the late 19th centurywas perceived by african nationalist a inappropriate because of it colonial origin and connotation .
according to mawema , black nationalist held a meeting in 1960 to choose an alternative name for the country , proposing name such a `` matshobana '' and `` monomotapa '' before his suggestion , `` zimbabwe '' , prevailed . a further alternative , put forward by nationalist in matabeleland , had been `` matopos '' , referring to the matobo national park to the south of bulawayo .
it wa initially unclear how the chosen term wa to be useda letter written by mawema in 1961 refers to `` zimbabweland ''  but `` zimbabwe '' wa sufficiently established by 1962 to become the generally preferred term of the black nationalist movement . in a 2001 interview , black nationalist edson zvobgo recalled that mawema mentioned the name during a political rally , `` and it caught hold , and that wa that '' . the black nationalist faction subsequently used the name during the second chimurenga campaign against the rhodesian government during the rhodesian bush war of 19641979 . major faction in this camp included the zimbabwe african national union ( led by robert mugabe from 1975 ) , and the zimbabwe african people 's union ( led by joshua nkomo from it founding in the early 1960s ) .
<section_title_start> history <section_title_end>
<section_title_start>  before 1887  <section_title_end>
archaeological record date human settlement of present-day zimbabwe to at least 100,000 year ago . the earliest known inhabitant were probably san people , who left behind arrowhead and cave painting . the first bantu-speaking farmer arrived during the bantu expansion around 2,000 year ago .
society speaking proto-shona language first emerged in the middle limpopo valley in the 9th century before moving on to the zimbabwean highland . the zimbabwean plateau eventually became the centre of subsequent shona state , beginning around the 10th century . around the early 10th century , trade developed with shirazi era on the indian ocean coast , helping to develop the kingdom of mapungubwe in the 11th century . this wa the precursor to the shona civilisation that would dominate the region during the 13th to 15th century , evidenced by ruin at great zimbabwe , near masvingo , and by other smaller site . the main archaeological site us a unique dry stone architecture .
the kingdom of mapungubwe wa the first in a series of trading state which had developed in zimbabwe by the time the first european explorer arrived from portugal . these state traded gold , ivory , and copper for cloth and glass .
from about 1300 until 1600 the kingdom of zimbabwe eclipsed mapungubwe . this shona state further refined and expanded upon mapungubwe 's stone architecture , which survives to this day at the ruin of the kingdom 's capital of great zimbabwe . from 1450 to 1760 zimbabwe gave way to the kingdom of mutapa . this shona state ruled much of the area of present-day zimbabwe , plus part of central mozambique . it is known by many name including the mutapa empire , also known a mwene mutapa or monomotapa a well a `` munhumutapa '' , and wa renowned for it strategic trade route with the arab and portugal . the portuguese sought to monopolise this influence and began a series of war which left the empire in near collapse in the early 17th century .
a a direct response to increased european presence in the interior a new shona state emerged , known a the rozwi empire ( 16841834 ) . relying on century of military , political and religious development , the rozwi ( meaning `` destroyer '' ) expelled the portuguese from the zimbabwean plateau by force of arm . they continued the stone-building tradition of the zimbabwe and mapungubwe kingdom while adding musket to their arsenal and recruiting a professional army to defend recent conquest .
around 1821 the zulu people general mzilikazi of the khumalo clan successfully rebelled against king shaka and established his own clan , the ndebele people ( zimbabwe ) . the ndebele fought their way northward into the south african republic , leaving a trail of destruction in their wake and beginning an era of widespread devastation known a the mfecane . when dutch people boer converged on the transvaal in 1836 , they drove the tribe even further northward , with the assistance of tswana people barolong warrior and griqua people commando . by 1838 the ndebele had conquered the rozwi empire , along with the other smaller shona state , and reduced them to vassaldom .
after losing their remaining south african land in 1840 , mzilikazi and his tribe permanently settled in the southwest of present-day zimbabwe in what became known a matabeleland , establishing bulawayo a their capital . mzilikazi then organised his society into a military system with regimental kraal , similar to those of shaka , which wa stable enough to repel further boer incursion . mzilikazi died in 1868 ; following a violent power struggle , his son lobengula succeeded him .

in the 1880s european colonist arrived with cecil rhodes 's british south africa company ( bsac , incorporated in 1888 , chartered in 1889 ) . in 1888 rhodes obtained a rudd concession from king lobengula of the ndebele people ( zimbabwe ) people .
he presented this concession to persuade the government of the united kingdom to grant a royal charter to the company over matabeleland , and it subject state such a mashonaland a well .
rhodes used this document in 1890 to justify sending the pioneer column , a group of european protected by well-armed british south africa police ( bsap ) through matabeleland and into shona territory to establish fort salisbury ( present-day harare ) , and thereby establish company rule in rhodesia over the area . in 1893 and 1894 , with the help of their new maxim gun gun , the bsap would go on to defeat the ndebele in the first matabele war . rhodes additionally sought permission to negotiate similar concession covering all territory between the limpopo river and lake tanganyika , then known a `` zambesia '' .
in accordance with the term of aforementioned concession and treaty , mass settlement wa encouraged , with the british maintaining control over labour a well a over precious metal and other mineral resource .
in 1895 the bsac adopted the name rhodesia ( name ) `` rhodesia '' for the territory , in honour of rhodes . in 1898 `` southern rhodesia '' became the official name for the region south of the zambezi , which later adopted the name `` zimbabwe '' . the region to the north , administered separately , wa later termed northern rhodesia ( present-day zambia ) . shortly after rhodes ' the disastrous rhodes-sponsored jameson raid ( december 1895 - january 1896 ) on the south african republic , the ndebele rebelled against white rule , led by their charismatic religious leader , mlimo . the second matabele war of 1896-1897 lasted in matabeleland until 1896 , when a british operation had mlimo assassinated . shona agitator staged unsuccessful revolt ( known a chimurenga ) against company rule during 1896 and 1897.
following these failed insurrection , the rhodes administration subdued the ndebele and shona group and organised the land with a disproportionate bias favouring european , thus displacing many indigenous people .
the united kingdom annexed southern rhodesia on 12 september 1923 . shortly after annexation , on 1 october 1923 , the first constitution for the new colony of southern rhodesia came into force .
under the new constitution , southern rhodesia became a self-governing colony self-governing british empire , subsequent to a 1922 southern rhodesian government referendum . rhodesians of all race served on behalf of the united kingdom during the two world war in the early-20th century . proportional to the white population , southern rhodesia contributed more per caput to both the southern rhodesia in world war i and southern rhodesia in world war ii than any other part of the empire , including britain itself .
the land apportionment act of 1930 restricted black land ownership to certain segment of the country , setting aside large area solely for the purchase of the white minority . this act , which led to rapidly rising inequality , became the subject of frequent call for subsequent land reform .
in 1953 , in the face of african opposition , britain consolidated the two rhodesia with nyasaland ( malawi ) in the ill-fated federation of rhodesia and nyasaland , which southern rhodesia essentially dominated . growing african nationalism and general dissent , particularly in nyasaland , persuaded britain to dissolve the union in 1963 , forming three separate division . while multiracial democracy wa finally introduced to northern rhodesia and nyasaland , however , southern rhodesians of european ancestry continued to enjoy minority rule .
following zambian independence ( effective from october 1964 ) , ian smith 's rhodesian front ( rf ) government in salisbury dropped the designation `` southern '' in 1964 ( once northern rhodesia had changed it name to zambia , having the word southern before the name rhodesia became unnecessary and the country simply became known a rhodesia afterwards ) . intent on effectively repudiating the recently adopted british policy of `` no independence before majority rule '' , smith issued a rhodesia 's unilateral declaration of independence ( commonly abbreviated to `` udi '' ) from the united kingdom on 11 november 1965 . this marked the first such course taken by a rebel british colony since the united state declaration of independence of 1776 , which smith and others indeed claimed provided a suitable precedent to their own action .
<section_title_start> udi and civil war ( 19651980 )  <section_title_end>
after the rhodesia 's unilateral declaration of independence ( udi ) , the british government petitioned the united nation for economic sanction against rhodesia pending unsuccessful talk with smith 's administration in 1966 and 1968 . in december 1966 , the organisation complied , imposing the first mandatory trade embargo on an autonomous state . these sanction were expanded again in 1968.
the united kingdom deemed the rhodesian declaration an act of rebellion , but did not re-establish control by force . a rhodesian bush war subsequently ensued when joshua nkomo 's zimbabwe african people 's union ( zapu ) and robert mugabe 's zimbabwe african national union ( zanu ) , supported actively by communist power and neighbouring african nation , initiated guerrilla operation against rhodesia 's predominantly white government . zapu wa supported by the soviet union , the warsaw pact and associated nation such a cuba , and adopted a marxismleninism marxistleninist ideology ; zanu meanwhile aligned itself with maoism and the bloc headed by the people 's republic of china . smith declared rhodesia a republic in 1970 , following the result of a rhodesian constitutional referendum , 1969 the previous year , but this went unrecognised internationally . meanwhile , rhodesia 's internal conflict intensified , eventually forcing him to open negotiation with the militant communist .
in march 1978 , smith reached an accord with three african leader , led by bishop abel muzorewa , who offered to leave the white population comfortably entrenched in exchange for the establishment of a biracial democracy . a a result of the internal settlement , zimbabwe rhodesia general election , 1979 were held in april 1979 , concluding with the united african national council ( uanc ) carrying a majority of parliamentary seat . on 1 june 1979 , muzorewa , the uanc head , became prime minister and the country 's name wa changed to zimbabwe rhodesia . the internal settlement left control of the rhodesian security force , civil service , judiciary , and a third of parliament seat to white . on 12 june , the united state senate voted to lift economic pressure on the former rhodesia .
following the commonwealth head of government meeting 1979 ( chogm ) , held in lusaka , zambia from 1 to 7 august in 1979 , the british government invited muzorewa , mugabe , and nkomo to participate in a constitutional conference at lancaster house . the purpose of the conference wa to discus and reach an agreement on the term of an independence constitution , and provide for election supervised under british authority allowing zimbabwe rhodesia to proceed to legal independence .
with peter carington , 6th baron carrington , secretary of state for foreign and commonwealth affair of the united kingdom , in the chair , these discussion were mounted from 10 september to 15 december in 1979 , producing a total of 47 plenary session . on 21 december 1979 , delegation from every major interest represented reached the lancaster house agreement , effectively ending the guerrilla war .
on 11 december 1979 , the rhodesian house of assembly voted 90 to nil to revert to british colonial status ( the 'aye ' vote included ian smith himself ) . the bill then passed the senate and wa assented to by the president . with the arrival of christopher soames , baron soames , the new governor , just after 2 p.m. on 12 december 1979 , britain formally took control of zimbabwe rhodesia a the colony of southern rhodesia , although on 13 december soames declared that during his mandate the name rhodesia and zimbabwe rhodesia would continue to be used . britain lifted sanction on 12 december , and the united nation on 16 december , before calling on it member state to do likewise on 21 december . thus zambia , mozambique , tanzania , angola and botswana lifted sanction on 2223 december ; australia partly pre-empted this , lifting all but trade sanction on 18 december , and trade sanction on 21 december .
during the zimbabwean parliamentary election , 1980 , robert mugabe and the zanu party secured a landslide victory . prince charles , a the representative of britain , formally granted independence to the new nation of zimbabwe at a ceremony in harare in april 1980.
<section_title_start> independence era ( 1980present )  <section_title_end>
list of president of zimbabwe zimbabwe 's first president after it independence wa canaan banana in what wa originally a mainly ceremonial role a head of state . robert mugabe , leader of the zanu party , wa the country 's first prime minister and head of government .
<section_title_start>  gukurahundi genocide ( 1983-87 )  <section_title_end>
opposition to what wa perceived a a shona takeover immediately erupted around matabeleland . the matabele unrest led to what ha become known a gukurahundi ( `` the early rain which wash away the chaff before the spring rain '' ) . the zimbabwean fifth brigade , a north korean-trained elite unit that reported directly to the zimbabwean prime minister , entered matabeleland and massacred thousand of civilian accused of supporting `` dissident '' .
estimate for the number of death during the five-year gukurahundi campaign ranged from 3,750 to 80,000.
thousand of others were tortured in military internment camp . the campaign officially ended in 1987 after nkomo and mugabe reached a unity agreement that merged their respective party , creating the zanupf zimbabwe african national union  patriotic front ( zanupf ) .
zimbabwean general election , 1990 resulted in another victory for mugabe and the zanupf party , which claimed 117 of the 120 contested seat .
during the 1990s , student , trade unionist , and other worker often demonstrated to express their growing discontent with mugabe and zanupf party policy . in 1996 , civil servant , nurse , and junior doctor went on strike over salary issue . the general health of the population also began to significantly decline ; by 1997 an estimated 25 % of the population had been infected by hiv in a pandemic that wa affecting most of southern africa .
land redistribution re-emerged a the main issue for the zanu ( pf ) zanupf government around 1997 . despite the existence of a `` willing-buyer-willing-seller '' land reform programme since the 1980s , the minority white zimbabwean population of around 0.6 % continued to hold 70 % of the country 's most fertile agricultural land .
in 2000 , the government pressed ahead with it land reform in zimbabwe # fast-track land reform and violence programme , a policy involving compulsory land acquisition aimed at redistributing land from the minority white population to the majority black population . confiscation of white farmland , continuous drought , and a serious drop in external finance and other support led to a sharp decline in agricultural export , which were traditionally the country 's leading export-producing sector . some 58,000 independent black farmer have since experienced limited success in reviving the gutted cash crop sector through effort on a smaller scale .
president mugabe and the zanupf party leadership found themselves beset by a wide range of international sanction . in 2002 , the nation wa suspended from the commonwealth of nation due to the reckless farm seizure and blatant electoral fraud . the following year , zimbabwean official voluntarily terminated it commonwealth membership . in 2001 , the u enacted the zimbabwe democracy and economic recovery act of 2001 ( zdera ) . it came into effect in 2002 and froze credit to the zimbabwean government . the bill wa sponsored by bill frist and co-sponsored by u senator hillary clinton , joe biden , rus feingold , and jesse helm . through zdera section 4c ( `` multilateral financing restriction '' ) , the secretary of the treasury is ordered to direct u director at the international financial institution listed in section 3 , `` to oppose and vote against -- ( 1 ) any extension by the respective institution of any loan , credit , or guarantee to the government of zimbabwe ; or ( 2 ) any cancellation or reduction of indebtedness owed by the government of zimbabwe to the united state or any international financial institution . ''
by 2003 , the country 's economy had collapsed . it is estimated that up to a quarter of zimbabwe 's 11 million people had fled the country . three-quarters of the remaining zimbabwean were living on le than one u dollar a day .
following zimbabwean parliamentary election , 2005 , the government initiated `` operation murambatsvina '' , an effort to crack down on illegal market and slum emerging in town and city , leaving a substantial section of urban poor homeless . the zimbabwean government ha described the operation a an attempt to provide decent housing to the population , although according to critic such a amnesty international , authority have yet to properly substantiate their claim .
on 29 march 2008 , zimbabwe held a zimbabwean presidential election , 2008 along with a zimbabwean parliamentary election , 2008 . the result of this election were withheld for two week , after which it wa generally acknowledged that the movement for democratic change  tsvangirai ( mdc-t ) had achieved a majority of one seat in the lower house of parliament .
on 10 july 2008 , russia and china vetoed un zimbabwe sanction pushed by britain and the u . the u drafted the file , which would have placed an arm embargo on mugabe 's regime . however , nine of 15 country on the un council opposed it , including vietnam , south africa , and libya , which argued that zimbabwe wa not a 'threat to international peace and security . '
in late 2008 , problem in zimbabwe reached crisis proportion in the area of living standard , public health ( with a major zimbabwean cholera outbreak in december ) and various basic affair . during this period ngo took over from government a a primary provider of food during this period of food insecurity in zimbabwe .
in september 2008 , a 20082009 zimbabwean political negotiation power-sharing agreement wa reached between tsvangirai and president mugabe , permitting the former to hold the office of prime minister . due to ministerial difference between their respective political party , the agreement wa not fully implemented until 13 february 2009 . by december 2010 , mugabe wa threatening to completely expropriate remaining privately owned company in zimbabwe unless `` western sanction '' were lifted .
a 2011 survey by freedom house suggested that living condition had improved since the power-sharing agreement . the united nation office for the coordination of humanitarian affair stated in it 20122013 planning document that the `` humanitarian situation ha improved in zimbabwe since 2009 , but condition remain precarious for many people '' .
on 17 january 2013 , vice-president john nkomo died of cancer at st anne 's hospital , harare at the age of 78 . a new constitution approved in the zimbabwean constitutional referendum , 2013 curtails presidential power .
mugabe wa re-elected president in the july 2013 zimbabwean general election , 2013 which the economist described a `` rigged . '' and the the daily telegraph a `` stolen '' . the movement for democratic change  tsvangirai alleged massive fraud and tried to seek relief through the court . in a surprising moment of candour at the zanupf congress in december 2014 , president robert mugabe accidentally let slip that the opposition had in fact won the contentious 2008 poll by an astounding 73 % . after winning the election , the mugabe zanupf government re-instituted one party rule , doubled the civil service and , according to the economist , embarked on `` misrule and dazzling corruption '' . a 2017 study conducted by the institute for security study ( i ) concluded that due to the deterioration of government and the economy `` the government encourages corruption to make up for it inability to fund it own institution '' with widespread and informal police roadblock to issue fine to traveller being one manifestation of this .
in july 2016 2016 zimbabwe protest took place regarding the economic collapse in the country , and the finance minister admitted `` right now we literally have nothing . ''
in november 2017 , 2017 zimbabwean coup d'tat the army led a coup d'tat following the dismissal of vice-president emmerson mnangagwa , placing mugabe under house arrest . the army denied that their action constituted a coup . mugabe resigned on 21 november 2017 , after leading the country for 37 year . although under the constitution of zimbabwe mugabe should be succeeded by vice-president phelekezela mphoko , a supporter of grace mugabe , zanupf chief whip lovemore matuke stated to the reuters news agency that mnangagwa would be appointed a president .
in december 2017 the website zimbabwe news , calculating the cost of the mugabe era using various statistic , said that at the time of independence in 1980 , the country wa growing economically at about five per cent a year , and had done so for quite a long time . if this rate of growth had been maintained for the next 37 year , zimbabwe would have in 2016 a gdp of u $ 52 billion . instead it had a formal sector gdp of only u $ 14 billion , a cost of u $ 38 billion in lost growth . the population growth in 1980 wa among the highest in africa at about 3.5 per cent per annum , doubling every 21 year . had this growth been maintained , the population would have been 31 million . instead , a of 2018 , it is about 13 million . the discrepancy were believed to be partly caused by death from starvation and disease , and partly due to decreased fertility . the life expectancy ha halved , and death from politically motivated violence sponsored by government exceeds 200,000 since 1980 . the mugabe government ha directly or indirectly caused the death of at least three million zimbabwean in 37 year . according to world food programme , over two million people are facing starvation because of the recent drought the country is going through .

<section_title_start> economy <section_title_end>
mineral , gold , and agriculture are the main foreign export of zimbabwe . tourism also play a key role in it economy .
the mining sector remains very lucrative , with some of the world 's largest platinum reserve being mined by anglo american plc and impala platinum . the marange diamond field , discovered in 2006 , are considered the biggest diamond find in over a century . they have the potential to improve the fiscal situation of the country considerably , but almost all revenue from the field have disappeared into the pocket of army officer and zanupf politician .
in term of carat produced , the marange field is one of the largest diamond producing project in the world , estimated to produce 12 million carat in 2014 worth over $ 350 million . zimbabwe is the biggest trading partner of south africa on the continent .
tax and tariff are high for private enterprise , while state enterprise are strongly subsidised . state regulation is costly to company ; starting or closing a business is slow and costly . government spending wa predicted to reach 67 % of gdp in 2007.
tourism wa an important industry for the country , but ha been failing in recent year . the zimbabwe conservation task force released a report in june 2007 , estimating 60 % of zimbabwe 's wildlife ha died since 2000 due to poaching and deforestation . the report warns that the loss of life combined with widespread deforestation is potentially disastrous for the tourist industry .
the information and communication technology sector of zimbabwe ha been growing at a fast pace . a report by the mobile internet browser company , opera , in june/july 2011 ha ranked zimbabwe a africa 's fastest growing market .
since 1 january 2002 , the government of zimbabwe ha had it line of credit at international financial institution frozen , through u legislation called the zimbabwe democracy and economic recovery act of 2001 ( zdera ) . section 4c instructs the secretary of the treasury to direct director at international financial institution to veto the extension of loan and credit to the zimbabwean government . according to the united state , these economic sanction target only seven specific business owned or controlled by government official and not ordinary citizen .
zimbabwe maintained positive economic growth throughout the 1980s ( 5 % gdp growth per year ) and 1990s ( 4.3 % gdp growth per year ) . the economy declined from 2000 : 5 % decline in 2000 , 8 % in 2001 , 12 % in 2002 and 18 % in 2003 . zimbabwe 's involvement from 1998 to 2002 in the war in the democratic republic of the congo drained hundred of million of dollar from the economy . from 1999 to 2009 , zimbabwe saw the lowest ever economic growth with an annual gdp decrease of 6.1 % .
the downward spiral of the economy ha been attributed mainly to mismanagement and corruption by the government and the eviction of more than 4,000 white farmer in the controversial land confiscation of 2000 . the zimbabwean government and it supporter attest that it wa western policy to avenge the expulsion of their kin that sabotaged the economy .
by 2005 , the purchasing power of the average zimbabwean had dropped to the same level in real term a 1953 . in 2005 , the government , led by central bank governor gideon gono , started making overture that white farmer could come back . there were 400 to 500 still left in the country , but much of the land that had been confiscated wa no longer productive . by 2016 there were about 300 farm owned by white farmer left out of the original 4,500 . the farm left were either too remote or their owner had paid for protection or collaborated with the regime .
in january 2007 , the government issued long-term lease to some white farmer . at the same time , however , the government also continued to demand that all remaining white farmer , who were given eviction notice earlier , vacate the land or risk being arrested . mugabe pointed to foreign government and alleged `` sabotage '' a the cause of the fall of the zimbabwean economy , a well a the country 's 80 % formal unemployment rate .
inflation rose from an annual rate of 32 % in 1998 , to an official estimated high of 11,200,000 % in august 2008 according to the country 's central statistical office . this represented a state of hyperinflation in zimbabwe , and the central bank introduced a new 100 trillion dollar note .
on 29 january 2009 , in an effort to counteract runaway inflation , acting finance minister patrick chinamasa announced that zimbabwean will be permitted to use other , more stable currency to do business , alongside the zimbabwe dollar . in an effort to combat inflation and foster economic growth the zimbabwean dollar wa suspended indefinitely on 12 april 2009 . in 2016 zimbabwe allowed trade in the united state dollar and various other currency such a the south african rand ( south africa ) , the botswana pula ( botswana ) , the euro , and the pound sterling ( uk ) . in february 2019 , rbz governor introduced a new local currency , the rtgs dollar in a move to address some of the zimbabwean economic and financial challenge .
after the formation of the unity government and the adoption of several currency instead of the zimbabwe dollar in 2009 , the zimbabwean economy rebounded . gdp grew by 89 % a year between 2009 and 2012 . in november 2010 , the imf described the zimbabwean economy a `` completing it second year of buoyant economic growth '' . by 2014 , zimbabwe had recovered to level seen in the 1990s but between 2012 and 2016 growth faltered .
zimplats , the nation 's largest platinum company , ha proceeded with u $ 500 million in expansion , and is also continuing a separate u $ 2 billion project , despite threat by mugabe to nationalise the company . the pan-african investment bank imara ( bank ) released a favourable report in february 2011 on investment prospect in zimbabwe , citing an improved revenue base and higher tax receipt .

<section_title_start> agriculture <section_title_end>
zimbabwe 's commercial farming sector wa traditionally a source of export and foreign exchange , and provided 400,000 job . however , the government 's land reform program badly damaged the sector , turning zimbabwe into a net importer of food product . for example , between 2000 and 2016 , annual wheat production fell from 250,000 ton to 60,000 ton , maize wa reduced from two million ton to 500,000 ton and cattle slaughtered for beef fell from 605,000 to 244,000 . coffee production , once a prized export commodity , came to a virtual halt after seizure or expropriation of white-owned coffee farm in 2000 and ha never recovered .
for the past ten year , the international crop research institute for the semi-arid tropic ( icrisat ) ha been assisting zimbabwe 's farmer to adopt conservation agriculture technique , a sustainable method of farming that can help increase yield . by applying the three principle of minimum soil disturbance , legume-based cropping and the use of organic mulch , farmer can improve infiltration , reduce evaporation and soil erosion , and build up organic soil content .
between 2005 and 2011 , the number of smallholder practising conservation agriculture in zimbabwe increased from 5,000 to more than 150,000 . cereal yield rose between 15 and 100 per cent across different region .

zimbabwe ha several major tourist attraction . victoria fall , zambia on the zambezi , which are shared with zambia , are located in the north west of zimbabwe . before the economic change , much of the tourism for these location came to the zimbabwe side but now zambia is the main beneficiary . the victoria fall national park is also in this area and is one of the eight main national park in zimbabwe , the largest of which is hwange national park .
the eastern highland are a series of mountainous area near the border with mozambique . the highest peak in zimbabwe , mount nyangani at is located here a well a the bvumba mountain and the nyanga national park . world 's view , nyanga world 's view is in these mountain and it is from here that place a far away a are visible and , on clear day , the town of rusape can be seen .

<section_title_start> water supply and sanitation <section_title_end>
water supply and sanitation in zimbabwe is defined by many small scale successful program but also by a general lack of improved water and sanitation system for the majority of zimbabwe . according to the world health organization in 2012 , 80 % of zimbabwean had access to improved , i.e . clean , drinking-water source , and only 40 % of zimbabwean had access to improved sanitation facility . access to improved water supply and sanitation is distinctly le in rural area .
there are many factor which continue to determine the nature , for the foreseeable future , of water supply and sanitation in zimbabwe .
three major factor are the severely depressed state of the zimbabwean economy , the reluctance of foreign aid organisation to build and
finance infrastructure project , and the political instability of the zimbabwean state .
<section_title_start>  science and technology  <section_title_end>
zimbabwe ha relatively well-developed national infrastructure and a long-standing tradition of promoting research and development ( r & d ) , a evidenced by the levy imposed on tobacco-growers since the 1930s to promote market research .
the country also ha a well-developed education system , with one in 11 adult holding a tertiary degree . given the country 's solid knowledge base and abundant natural resource , zimbabwe ha the potential to figure among the country leading growth in sub-saharan africa by 2020.
to do so , however , zimbabwe will need to correct a number of structural weakness . for instance , it lack the critical mass of researcher needed to trigger innovation . although the infrastructure is in place to harness research and development to zimbabwe 's socio-economic development , university and research institution lack the financial and human resource to conduct research and the regulatory environment hamper the transfer of new technology to the business sector . the economic crisis ha precipitated an exodus of university student and professional in key area of expertise ( medicine , engineering , etc . ) that is of growing concern . more than 22 % of zimbabwean tertiary student were completing their degree abroad in 2012 , compared to a 4 % average for sub-saharan africa a a whole . in 2012 , there were 200 researcher ( head count ) employed in the public sector , one-quarter of whom were woman . this is double the continental average ( 91 in 2013 ) but only one-quarter the researcher density of south africa ( 818 per million inhabitant ) . the government ha created the zimbabwe human capital website to provide information for the diaspora on job and investment opportunity in zimbabwe .
despite the fact that human resource are a pillar of any research and innovation policy , the medium term plan 20112015 did not discus any explicit policy for promoting postgraduate study in science and engineering . the scarcity of new phd in science and engineering field from the university of zimbabwe in 2013 wa symptomatic of this omission .
nor doe the development agenda to 2018 , the zimbabwe agenda for sustainable economic transformation , contain any specific target for increasing the number of scientist and engineer , or the staffing requirement for industry and other productive sector . in addition , the lack of co-ordination and coherence among governance structure ha led to a multiplication of research priority and poor implementation of existing policy .
the country 's second science and technology policy wa launched in june 2012 , after being elaborated with unesco assistance . it replaces the earlier policy dating from 2002 . the 2012 policy prioritises biotechnology , information and communication technology ( icts ) , space science , nanotechnology , indigenous knowledge system , technology yet to emerge and scientific solution to emergent environmental challenge . the second science and technology policy also asserts the government commitment to allocating at least 1 % of gdp to research and development , focusing at least 60 % of university education on developing skill in science and technology and ensuring that school pupil devote at least 30 % of their time to studying science subject .
in 2014 , zimbabwe counted 21 publication per million inhabitant in internationally catalogued journal , according to thomson reuters ' web of science ( science citation index expanded ) . this placed zimbabwe sixth out of the 15 sadc country , behind namibia ( 59 ) , mauritius ( 71 ) , botswana ( 103 ) and , above all , south africa ( 175 ) and the seychelles ( 364 ) . the average for sub-saharan africa wa 20 scientific publication per million inhabitant , compared to a global average of 176 per million .

<section_title_start>  gender equality  <section_title_end>
woman in zimbabwe are disadvantaged in many facet including economic , political , and social sphere , and experience sex and gender based violence . a 2014 un report found that deep rooted cultural issue , patriarchal attitude , and religious practice negatively impacted woman 's right and freedom in the country . these negative view toward woman a well a societal norm impact the incentive for woman to participate in the economy and hinder their economic production . zimbabwe 's constitution passed in 2013 ha provision in it that provide incentive to achieve greater gender equality but the data show that enforcement ha been lax and adoption slow . in december 2016 the international federation of red cross and red crescent society conducted a case study to determine how to best implement effective policy to address issue such a gender violence and implementation of equality law . it wa found that sex and gender based violence against woman and girl wa increasing in area that had experienced disaster ( flood , drought , disease ) but could not quantify the extent of the increase . some of the obstacle in combating these issue are that there are economic barrier to declaring sgbv to be unacceptable a well a social barrier . additionally , governmental service which were installed to help educate the populace about these issue a well a provide service to victim are underfunded and unable to carry out their duty . the un also provided economic incentive to adopt policy which would discourage these practice which negatively impacted woman in zimbabwe .
<section_title_start>  discrimination in the work force  <section_title_end>

zimbabwe experience high rate of domestic and sexual violence ; the zimbabwe national statistic office show that rate are increasing . 21 rape are reported per day in zimbabwe - a rate of 0.12 rape a day per 100,000 people . a not all rape are reported , the actual number is likely higher . reported rape increased 42 % between 2010 and 2016 . of all the violence against girl and woman reported in zimbabwe , 78 % wa inflicted by their spouse , father , or domestic partner . unicef report show that one in three girl that grow up in zimbabwe experience sexual assault before turning 18 , this is further exacerbated by cultural norm such a child marriage . young girl often run away with older men when their educational opportunity are limited or to escape a violent household . these incident of domestic violence or young girl running away with older men are usually not investigated by police a men are viewed a superior to woman in zimbabwean culture and their role a the dominant person in the relationship is to discipline their spouse , often violently . there is an ingrained cultural norm that violence can be a show of power and love which make ending domestic abuse in zimbabwe difficult . the zimbabwe woman 's lawyer association is an organisation that is assisting the implementation of the legal framework , a defined in the 2013 constitution , to help woman . the association provides programme which help educate woman on their right and provides them with opportunity a a way of combating domestic and sexual violence .
<section_title_start>  political representation  <section_title_end>
woman in zimbabwe do not have proportional representation in the zimbabwean lower and upper house of parliament holding 14 % and 33 % of seat respectively , despite being a slight majority of the population . there are cultural and violence barrier woman have to overcome to run for public office ; they are seen a `` loose and immoral '' , called prostitute , claimed to want to be men , and their private life are heavily scrutinised . woman seeking to participate in the political landscape a candidate or voter cite violence a one of the main reason they are dissuaded from participating . lack of financial resource and confidence in their ability stop many young woman from attempting to run a well a preconceived notion about woman in politics creates an environment that limit their involvement and desire to be involved in politics . woman also make up a disproportionate amount of the rural poor in zimbabwe and make up 70 % of the agricultural work force . the rural poor find it difficult to access information and material in relation to politics a well a travel to polling station and become registered to vote . collectively , woman control 35 % of parliamentary seat a a result of a provision of the 2013 constitution that mandated at least 30 % of seat be occupied by woman . a 10-year extension is being considered to this mandate a it is only law until 2022 and equal representation according to population distribution ha not yet been achieved . a study by the research and advocacy unit found that political party in the country appoint woman to `` window dress '' and not for their political advancement .
<section_title_start>  society and culture  <section_title_end>
woman in zimbabwean society and culture are often seen a inferior , treated a object , and viewed in subordinate role in history and philosophy . ubuntu , an african philosophy 's spiritual aspect instills the belief that boy should be more valued than girl a boy pas on lineage and the belief system place high value in respecting one ancestor . a common expression used in court , `` vakadzi ngavanyarare '' , translates to `` woman should keep quiet '' and a a result woman are not consulted in decision-making ; they must implement the men 's wish . the subordination of woman in zimbabwe and the cultural force which dictate what they must be , have led to death and the sacrifice of professional advancement in order for them to fulfill their role a wife , mother , and subordinate . woman are taught that they must never refuse their husband sexual advance , even if they know they are infected with hiv from being unfaithful . a a result of this practice , zimbabwean woman aged 1549 have an hiv prevalence rate of 16.1 % and make up 62 % of the total population infected with hiv in that age group .

the bahamas ( ) , known officially a the commonwealth of the bahamas , is a country within the lucayan archipelago of the west indie in the atlantic . it take up 97 % of the lucayan archipelago 's land area and is home to 88 % of the archipelago 's population . the archipelagic state consists of more than 700 island , cay , and islet in the atlantic ocean , and is located north of cuba and northwest of the island of hispaniola ( split between haiti and the dominican republic ) and the turk and caicos island , southeast of the united state state of florida , and east of the florida key . the capital is nassau , bahamas on the island of new providence . the royal bahamas defence force describes the bahamas ' territory a encompassing of ocean space .
the bahamas were inhabited by the lucayan people , a branch of the arawakan-speaking tano people , for many century . christopher columbus wa the first european to see the island , making his first landfall in the 'new world ' in 1492 . later , the spain shipped the native lucayans to and enslaved them on hispaniola , after which the bahama island were mostly deserted from 1513 until 1648 , when kingdom of england colonist from bermuda settled on the island of eleuthera .
the bahamas became a kingdom of great britain crown colony in 1718 , when the british clamped down on piracy . after the american revolutionary war , the crown resettled thousand of american loyalist to the bahamas ; they took enslaved people with them and established plantation on land grant . african enslaved people and their descendant constituted the majority of the population from this period on . the slave trade wa abolished by the british in 1807 ; slavery in the bahamas wa abolished in 1834 . subsequently , the bahamas became a haven for freed african slave . african liberated from illegal slave ship were resettled on the island by the royal navy , while some slavery in north america and seminole escaped to the bahamas from florida . bahamian were even known to recognise the freedom of enslaved people carried by the ship of other nation which reached the bahamas . today afro-bahamians make up 90 % of the population of 332,634.
the country gained governmental independence in 1973 led by lynden pindling sir lynden o. pindling , with elizabeth ii a queen of the bahamas . in term of gross domestic product per caput , the bahamas is one of the richest country in the america ( following the united state and canada ) , with an economy based on tourism and offshore finance .
<section_title_start> etymology <section_title_end>
the name bahamas is most likely derived from either the tano language ba ha ma ( `` big upper middle land '' ) , which wa a term for the region used by the indigenous people , or possibly from the spanish language baja mar ( `` shallow water or sea '' or `` low tide '' ) reflecting the shallow water of the area . alternatively , it may originate from guanahani , a local name of unclear meaning .
the word the constitutes an integral part of the short form of the name and is , therefore , capitalised . the constitution of the commonwealth of the bahamas , the country 's fundamental law , capitalises the `` t '' in `` the bahamas '' .
<section_title_start> history <section_title_end>
<section_title_start> pre-colonial era <section_title_end>
the first inhabitant of the bahamas were the tano people people , who moved into the uninhabited southern island from hispaniola and cuba around the 800s1000s ad , having migrated there from south america ; they came to be known a the lucayan people . an estimated 30,000 lucayans inhabited the bahamas at the time of christopher columbus 's arrival in 1492.
<section_title_start> arrival of the spanish <section_title_end>
columbus 's first landfall in what wa to european a 'new world ' wa on an island he named san salvador ( known to the lucayans a guanahani ) . whilst there is a general consensus that this island lay within the bahamas , precisely which island columbus landed on is a matter of scholarly debate . some researcher believe the site to be present-day san salvador island ( formerly known a watling 's island ) , situated in the southeastern bahamas , whilst an alternative theory hold that columbus landed to the southeast on samana cay , according to calculation made in 1986 by national geographic ( magazine ) writer and editor joseph judge , based on columbus 's log . on the landfall island , columbus made first contact with the lucayans and exchanged good with them , claiming the island for the crown of castile , before proceeding to explore the larger isle of the greater antilles .
the 1494 treaty of tordesillas theoretically divided the new territory between the kingdom of castile and the kingdom of portugal , placing the bahamas in the spanish sphere ; however they did little to press their claim on the ground . the spanish did however exploit the native lucayan people , many of whom were enslaved and sent to hispaniola for use a forced labour . the slave suffered harsh condition and most died from contracting infectious disease to which they had no immunity ( medical ) ; half of the taino died from smallpox alone . a a result of these depredation the population of the bahamas wa severely diminished .
<section_title_start> arrival of the english <section_title_end>
the english had expressed an interest in the bahamas a early a 1629 . however , it wa not until 1648 that the first english settler arrived on the island . known a the eleutherian adventurer and led by william sayle , they migrated to bermuda seeking greater religious freedom . these english puritan established the first permanent european settlement on an island which they named 'eleuthera ' , greek for 'freedom ' . they later settled new providence , naming it sayle 's island . life proved harder than envisaged however , and many  including sayle  chose to return to bermuda . to survive , the remaining settler wrecking ( shipwreck ) # the bahamas .
in 1670 , charles ii of england granted the island to the lord proprietor of the province of carolina in north america . they rented the island from the king with right of trading , tax , appointing governor # british empire and commonwealth of nation , and administering the country from their base on new providence . piracy and attack from hostile foreign power were a constant threat . in 1684 , spanish privateer juan de alcon raid on charles town charles town ( later renamed nassau , bahamas ) , and in 1703 , a joint franco-spanish expedition raid on nassau during the war of the spanish succession .
<section_title_start> 18th century <section_title_end>
during proprietary rule , the bahamas became a haven for piracy , including blackbeard ( circa 16801718 ) . to put an end to the 'pirates ' republic ' and restore orderly government , great britain made the bahamas a british overseas territory in 1718 , which they dubbed `` the bahama island '' under the royal governorship of woodes rogers . after a difficult struggle , he succeeded in suppressing piracy . in 1720 , the raid on nassau ( 1720 ) during the war of the quadruple alliance . in 1729 , a local assembly wa established giving a degree of self-governance for the english settler . the reform had been planned by the previous governor george phenney and authorised in july 1728.
during the american war of independence in the late 18th century , the island became a target for u naval force . under the command of commodore esek hopkins , united state marine corp , the u navy occupied nassau in 1776 , before being evacuated a few day later . in 1782 a spanish fleet appeared off the coast of nassau , and the city capture of the bahamas ( 1782 ) . later , in april 1783 , on a visit made by prince william of the united kingdom ( later to become william iv of great britain ) to luis de unzaga at his residence in the captaincy general of havana , they made prisoner exchange agreement and also dealt with the preliminary of the treaty of paris ( 1783 ) , in which the recently conquered bahamas would be exchanged for spanish florida , which would still have to conquer the city of st. augustine , florida in 1784 by order of luis de unzaga ; after that , also in 1784 , the bahamas would be declared a british colony .
after u independence , the british resettled some 7,300 loyalist ( american revolution ) with their african slave in the bahamas , including 2,000 from new york and at least 1,033 european , 2,214 african ancestrals and a few native american creek people from east florida . most of the refugee resettled from new york had fled from other colony , including west florida , which the spanish captured during the war . the government granted land to the planter to help compensate for loss on the continent . these loyalist , who included deveaux and also lord dunmore , established plantation on several island and became a political force in the capital . european american were outnumbered by the african-american slave they brought with them , and ethnic european remained a minority in the territory .
<section_title_start> 19th century <section_title_end>
the slave trade act 1807 abolished slave trading to british possession , including the bahamas . the united kingdom pressured other slave-trading country to also abolish slave-trading , and give the royal navy the right to intercept ship carrying slave on the high sea . thousand of african liberated from slave ship by the royal navy were resettled in the bahamas .
in the 1820s during the period of the seminole war in florida , hundred of north american slave and african seminole escaped from cape florida to the bahamas . they settled mostly on northwest andros island , where they developed the village of red bay . from eyewitness account , 300 escaped in a mass flight in 1823 , aided by bahamian in 27 sloop , with others using canoe for the journey . this wa commemorated in 2004 by a large sign at bill baggs cape florida state park . some of their descendant in red bay continue african seminole tradition in basket making and grave marking .
in 1818 , the home office in london had ruled that `` any slave brought to the bahamas from outside the british west indie would be manumitted . '' this led to a total of nearly 300 enslaved people owned by u national being freed from 1830 to 1835 . the american slave ship comet and encomium used in the united state domestic coastwise slave trade , were wrecked off abaco island in december 1830 and february 1834 , respectively . when wrecker took the master , passenger and slave into nassau , custom officer seized the slave and british colonial official freed them , over the protest of the american . there were 165 slave on the comet and 48 on the encomium . the united kingdom finally paid an indemnity to the united state in those two case in 1855 , under the treaty of claim of 1853 , which settled several compensation case between the two country .
slavery wa slavery abolition act 1833 on 1 august 1834 . after that british colonial official freed 78 north american slave from the enterprise ( slave ship ) , which went into bermuda in 1835 ; and 38 from the hermosa , which wrecked off abaco island in 1840 . the most notable case wa that of the creole case in 1841 : a a result of a slave revolt on board , the leader ordered the u brig to nassau . it wa carrying 135 slave from virginia destined for sale in new orleans . the bahamian official freed the 128 slave who chose to stay in the island . the creole case ha been described a the `` most successful slave revolt in u.s. history '' .
these incident , in which a total of 447 enslaved people belonging to u national were freed from 1830 to 1842 , increased tension between the united state and the united kingdom of great britain and ireland . they had been co-operating in patrol to suppress the international slave trade . however , worried about the stability of it large domestic slave trade and it value , the united state argued that the united kingdom should not treat it domestic ship that came to it colonial port under duress a part of the international trade . the united state worried that the success of the creole slave in gaining freedom would encourage more slave revolt on merchant ship .
during the american civil war of the 1860s , the island briefly prospered a a focus for blockade runner aiding the confederate state .
<section_title_start>  early 20th century <section_title_end>

a new constitution granting the bahamas internal autonomy went into effect on 7 january 1964 , with chief minister sir roland symonette of the ubp becoming the first premier . in 1967 , lynden pindling of the plp became the first black premier of the bahamian colony ; in 1968 , the title of the position wa changed to prime minister of the bahamas . in 1968 , pindling announced that the bahamas would seek full independence . a new constitution giving the bahamas increased control over it own affair wa adopted in 1968 . in 1971 , the ubp merged with a disaffected faction of the plp to form a new party , the free national movement ( fnm ) , a de-racialised , centre-right party which aimed to counter the growing power of pindling 's plp .

mauritius ( ; maurice ; moris wiktionary : appendix : mauritian creole pronunciation [ mois ] ) , officially the republic of mauritius , is an island nation in the indian ocean about 2,000 kilometre ( 1,200 ; mi ) off the southeast coast of the african continent , east of madagascar . it includes the main island ( also called mauritius ) , a well a and rodrigues , agalga and st. brandon . the island of mauritius and rodrigues , along with nearby runion ( a department of france ) , are part of the mascarene island . the capital and largest city , port louis , is located on mauritius , where most of the population is concentrated . the country span and ha an exclusive economic zone covering 2.3 million square kilometre .
by some account , arab sailor were the first to discover the uninhabited island , around 975 , and they called it dina arobi , but this ha not been confirmed . the earliest confirmed discovery wa in 1507 by portuguese sailor , who otherwise took little interest in the island . the dutch took possession in 1598 , establishing a succession of short-lived settlement over a period of about 120 year , before abandoning their effort in 1710 . france took control in 1715 , renaming it isle de france ( mauritius ) . in 1810 , the island invasion of isle de france by united kingdom , and four year later france treaty of paris ( 1814 ) to britain . a a british colony , mauritius included rodrigues , agalega , st. brandon , tromelin island , the chagos archipelago , and , until 1906 , the seychelles . sovereignty over tromelin is disputed between mauritius and france , a it wa not specifically mentioned in the treaty of paris . mauritius remained a primarily plantation-based colony of the united kingdom until independence in 1968.
in 1965 , three year before mauritius became independent , the uk split off the chagos archipelago from mauritian territory , and also split off the island of aldabra , farquhar , and desroches from the seychelles , to form the british indian ocean territory ( biot ) . the expulsion of the chagossians and the largest island , diego garcia , wa leased to the united state . the uk ha restricted access to the chagos archipelago , allowing entry to casual tourist , the medium , and former inhabitant . the sovereignty of the chagos is chagos archipelago sovereignty dispute between mauritius and the uk . in february 2019 , the international court of justice issued an advisory opinion ordering the uk to return the chagos island to mauritius a rapidly a possible to complete the decolonisation of mauritius .
owing to it geographic location and century of colonialism , the mauritian are highly diverse in ethnicity , multiculturalism , language and faith . it is the only country in africa where hinduism is the main religion with the most adherent . the island 's government is closely modelled on the westminster parliamentary system , and mauritius is highly ranked for democracy index and for list of country by economic freedom and freedom in the world . mauritius is categorised a `` very high '' in the human development index . according to the world bank , the country is classified a a world bank high-income economy high-income economy . mauritius is also ranked a the most competitive , and one of the most developed , economy in the african region . the country is a social democracy : the government provides free universal health care ; free education up through the tertiary level ; and free public transportation for student , senior citizen , and the disabled . in 2019 , mauritius wa ranked the most peaceful african country by the global peace index .
along with the other mascarene island , mauritius is known for it wildlife of mauritius . many specie are endemic to the island . the island wa the only known home of the dodo , which , along with several other avian specie , wa made extinct by human activity relatively soon after the island 's settlement .
<section_title_start> etymology <section_title_end>
the first historical evidence of the existence of an island now known a mauritius is on a map produced by the italian people cartographer alberto cantino in 1502 . from this , it appears that mauritius bore the name dina arobi , very likely the name shared with the portuguese by sailor from the subcontinent . in 1507 , portuguese sailor visited the uninhabited island . the island appears with a portuguese language name cirne on early portuguese map , probably from the name of a ship in the 1507 expedition . another portuguese sailor , dom ( title ) pedro mascarenhas , gave the name mascarene island to the archipelago .
in 1598 , dutch squadron under admiral wybrand van warwyck landed at grand port and named the island mauritius , in honour of maurice , prince of orange , stadtholder of the dutch republic . later the island became a french colony and wa renamed isle de france ( mauritius ) . on 3 december 1810 , the french surrendered the island to great britain during the napoleonic war . under british rule , the island 's name reverted to mauritius . mauritius is also commonly known a maurice ( ) and le maurice in french , moris ( ) in mauritian creole .

in 1598 a dutch squadron under admiral wybrand van warwyck landed at grand port and named the island `` mauritius '' after maurice , prince of orange ( dutch language : maurits van nassau ) of the dutch republic . the dutch inhabited the island in 1638 , from which they exploited ebony tree and introduced sugar cane , domestic animal and deer . it wa from here that dutch navigator abel tasman set out to seek the great southern land , mapping part of tasmania , aotearoa/new zealand and new guinea . the first dutch settlement lasted 20 year . in 1639 slave arrived in mauritius from madagascar . the dutch east india company brought them to cut down ebony tree and to work in the new tobacco and sugar cane plantation . several attempt to establish a colony permanently were subsequently made , but the settlement never developed enough to produce dividend , causing the dutch to abandon mauritius in 1710.
<section_title_start> french mauritius ( 17151810 )  <section_title_end>
france , which already controlled neighbouring le bourbon ( now runion ) , took control of mauritius in 1715 and renamed it isle de france ( mauritius ) . in 1723 , the code noir wa established to categorise one group of human being a `` good '' , in order for the owner of these good to be able to obtain insurance money and compensation in case of loss of his `` good '' . the 1735 arrival of french governor bertrand-franois mah de la bourdonnais coincided with development of a prosperous economy based on sugar production . mah de la bourdonnais established port louis a a naval base and a shipbuilding centre . under his governorship , numerous building were erected , a number of which are still standing . these include part of government house , the chteau de mon plaisir , and the line barrack , the headquarters of the mauritius police force . the island wa under the administration of the french east india company , which maintained it presence until 1767 . during the french rule slave were brought from part of africa such a mozambique and zanzibar . a a result the island 's population rose dramatically from 15,000 to 49,000 within 30 thirty year . during the late eighteenth century african slave accounted for around 80 percent of the island  s population , and by the early nineteenth century there were 60,000 slave on the island . in early 1729 indian from pondicherry pondicherry , india arrived in mauritius aboard the vessel la sirne . work contract for these craftsman were signed in 1734 at the time when they acquired their freedom .
from 1767 to 1810 , except for a brief period during the french revolution when the inhabitant set up a government virtually independent of france , the island wa controlled by official appointed by the french government . jacques-henri bernardin de saint-pierre lived on the island from 1768 to 1771 , then went back to france , where he wrote paul et virginie , a love story that made the isle de france famous wherever the french language wa spoken . in 1796 the settler broke away from french control when the government in paris attempted to abolish slavery . two famous french governor were the vicomte de souillac ( who constructed the chausse in port louis and encouraged farmer to settle in the district of savanne ) and antoine bruni d'entrecasteaux ( who saw to it that the french in the indian ocean should have their headquarters in mauritius instead of pondicherry in india ) . charles mathieu isidore decaen wa a successful general in the french revolutionary war and , in some way , a rival of napolon i . he ruled a governor of isle de france ( mauritius ) and runion from 1803 to 1810 . british naval cartographer and explorer matthew flinders wa arrested and detained by general decaen on the island from 1803 to 1810 , in contravention of an order from napolon . during the napoleonic war , mauritius became a base from which french corsair organised successful raid on british commercial ship . the raid continued until 1810 , when a royal navy expedition led by commodore ( royal navy ) josias rowley , royal navy r.n. , an anglo-irish aristocracy ( class ) , wa sent to capture the island . despite winning the battle of grand port , the only french naval victory over the british during these war , the invasion of le de france at cap malheureux three month later . they formally surrendered the island on the fifth day of the invasion , 3 december 1810 , on term allowing settler to keep their land and property and to use the french language and law of france in criminal and civil matter . under british rule , the island 's name reverted to mauritius . the swift conquest of mauritius wa fictionalised in the novel the mauritius command by patrick o'brian , first published in 1977.
<section_title_start> british mauritius ( 18101968 )  <section_title_end>
the british administration , which began with robert townsend farquhar a governor of british mauritius , led to rapid social and economic change . however , it wa tainted by the ratsitatane episode . ratsitatane , nephew of king radama of madagascar , wa brought to mauritius a a political prisoner . he managed to escape from prison and plotted a rebellion that would free the island 's slave . he wa betrayed by an associate and wa caught by the british force , summarily judged , and condemned to death . he wa beheaded at plaine verte on 15 april 1822 , and his head wa displayed a a deterrent against future uprising among the slave .
in 1832 , adrien d'pinay launched the first mauritian newspaper ( le cernen ) , which wa not controlled by the government . in the same year , there wa a move by the procureur-general to abolish slavery without compensation to the slave owner . this gave rise to discontent , and , to check an eventual rebellion , the government ordered all the inhabitant to surrender their arm . furthermore , a stone fortress , fort adelaide , wa built on a hill ( now known a the citadel hill ) in the centre of port louis to quell any uprising .
slavery wa abolished in 1835 , and the planter ultimately received two million pound sterling in compensation for the loss of their slave , who had been imported from africa and madagascar during the french occupation . the abolitionism in the united kingdom had important impact on mauritius 's society , economy and population . the planter brought a large number of indentured servant from india to work in the sugar cane field . between 1834 and 1921 , around half a million indentured labourer were present on the island . they worked on sugar estate , factory , in transport and on construction site . additionally , the british brought 8,740 indian people soldier to the island . aapravasi ghat , in the bay at port louis and now a unesco site , wa the first british colony to serve a a major reception centre for indentured servant .
an important figure of the 19th century wa rmy ollier , a journalist of mixed origin . in 1828 , the colour bar wa officially abolished in mauritius , but british governor gave little power to coloured person , and appointed only white a leading official . rmy ollier petitioned to queen victoria to allow coloureds in the council of government , and this became possible a few year later . he also made port louis become a municipality so that the citizen could administer the town through their own elected representative . a street ha been named after him in port louis , and his bust wa erected in the jardin de la compagnie in 1906 . in 1885 constitution of mauritius ( 1885 ) wa introduced and it wa referred to a cens dmocratique a it incorporated some of the principle advocated by one of the creole leader called onesipho beaugeard . it created elected position in the legislative council although the franchise wa restricted mainly to the white french and fair-skinned creole elite who owned real estate . in 1886 governor john pope hennessy nominated gnanadicarayen arlanda a the first ever indo-mauritian member of the ruling council despite the sugar oligarchy 's preference for rival indo-mauritian emile sandapa . arlanda served until 1891 . two main political party were active at that time , the pro-hennessy party being sir william newton 's reform party where a the anti-hennessy party democrat wa led by gustave de coriolis and onsipho beaugeard .
the labourer brought from india were not always fairly treated , and a german , adolph von plevitz , made himself the unofficial protector of these immigrant . he mixed with many of the labourer , and in 1871 helped them to write a petition that wa sent to arthur hamilton-gordon , 1st baron stanmore . a commission wa appointed to look into the complaint made by the indian immigrant , and in 1872 two lawyer , appointed by the british crown , were sent from england to make an inquiry . this royal commission recommended several measure that would affect the life of indian labourer during the next fifty year .
in november 1901 , mahatma gandhi visited mauritius , on his way from south africa to india . he stayed on the island for two week , and urged the indo-mauritian community to take an interest in education and to play a more active role in politics . back in india , he sent over a young lawyer , manilal doctor , to improve the plight of the indo-mauritians . during the same year , faster link were established with the island of rodrigues thanks to the wireless .
in 1903 , motorcar were introduced in mauritius , and in 1910 the first taxi , operated by joseph merven , came into service . the electrification of port louis took place in 1909 , and in the same decade the mauritius hydro electric company of the amode ibrahim atchia wa authorised to provide power to the town of upper plaines wilhems .
the 1910s were a period of political agitation . the rising middle class ( made up of doctor , lawyer , and teacher ) began to challenge the political power of the sugar cane landowner . dr. eugne laurent , mayor of port louis , wa the leader of this new group ; his party , action librale , demanded that more people should be allowed to vote in the election . action librale wa opposed by the parti de l'ordre , led by henri leclzio , the most influential of the sugar magnate . in 1911 there were riot in port louis due to a false rumour that dr. eugne laurent had been murdered by the oligarch in curepipe . this became known a the 1911 curepipe riot . shop and office were damaged in the capital , and one person wa killed . in the same year , 1911 , the first public cinema show took place in curepipe , and , in the same town , a stone building wa erected to house the royal college . in 1912 , a wider telephone network came into service , used by the government , business firm , and a few private household .
world war i broke out in august 1914 . many mauritian volunteered to fight in europe against the german and in mesopotamia against the turk . but the war affected mauritius much le than the war of the eighteenth century . in fact , the 19141918 war wa a period of great prosperity due to a boom in sugar price . in 1919 the mauritius sugar syndicate came into being , which included 70 % of all sugar producer .
the 1920s saw the rise of a `` retrocessionism '' movement , which favoured the retrocession of mauritius to france . the movement rapidly collapsed because none of the candidate who wanted mauritius to be given back to france were elected in the 1921 election . in the post-war recession , there wa a sharp drop in sugar price . many sugar estate closed down , marking the end of an era for the sugar magnate who had not only controlled the economy but also the political life of the country . raoul rivet , the editor of le mauricien newspaper , campaigned for a revision of the constitution that would give the emerging middle class a greater role in the running of the country . the principle of arya samaj began to infiltrate the hindu community , who clamoured for more social justice . at the 1926 election dunputh lallah and rajcoomar gujadhur became the first indo-mauritians to be elected at the legislative council . at grand port lallah won over rival fernand louis morel and gaston gebert ; at flacq gujadhur defeated pierre montocchio . after the end of nominated arlanda 's term in 1891 and until 1926 there had been no indo-mauritian representation in the legislative council .
1936 saw the birth of the labour party ( mauritius ) , launched by dr. maurice cur . emmanuel anquetil rallied the urban worker while pandit sahadeo concentrated on the rural working class . the uba riot of 1937 resulted in reform by the local british government that improved labour condition and led to the un-banning of labour union . labour day wa celebrated for the first time in 1938 . more than 30,000 worker sacrificed a day 's wage and came from all over the island to attend a giant meeting at the champ de mar . following the docker ' strike trade unionist emmanuel anquetil wa deported to rodrigues , maurice cur and pandit sahadeo were placed under house arrest whilst numerous striker were jailed . governor sir bede clifford assisted mr jules leclezio of the mauritius sugar syndicate to counter the effect of the strike by using alternative worker known a  black leg  .
at the outbreak of world war ii in 1939 , many mauritian volunteered to serve under the british flag in africa and the near east , fighting against the german and italian army . some went to england to become pilot and ground staff in the royal air force . mauritius wa never really threatened but several british ship were sunk outside port louis by german submarine in 1943.
during world war ii , condition were hard in the country ; the price of commodity doubled but worker  salary increased only by 10 to 20 percent . there wa civil unrest , and the colonial government censored all trade union activity . however , the labourer of belle vue harel sugar estate went on strike on 27 september 1943 . police officer eventually fired directly at the crowd , resulting in the death of 4 labourer soondrum pavatdan ( better known a anjalay coopen the 32 year old pregnant woman ) , moonsamy moonien ( 14 year old boy ) , kistnasamy mooneesamy ( 37 year old labourer ) , and marday panapen . this became known a the belle vue harel massacre . social worker and leader of the jan andolan movement basdeo bissoondoyal organised the funeral ceremony of the 4 dead labourer . three month later basdeo bissoondoyal organised a mass gathering at `` marie reine de la paix '' in port louis on 12 december 1943 and the significant crowd of worker from all over the island confirmed the popularity of his movement jan andolan .
after the proclamation of the new 1947 constitution the general election were held on 9 august 1948 and for the first time the colonial government expanded the franchise to all adult who could write their name in one of the island 's 19 language . guy rozemont 's labour party ( mauritius ) won the majority of the vote with 11 of the 19 elected seat won by hinduism . however , the governor of british mauritius governor-general donald mackenzie-kennedy appointed 12 conservative to the legislative council on 23 august 1948 to perpetuate the predominance of white franco-mauritians . in 1948 emilienne rochecouste became the first woman to be elected to the legislative council , serving until 1953 . guy rozemont 's party bettered it position in 1953 , and , on the strength of the election result , demanded universal suffrage . constitutional conference were held in london in 1955 and 1957 , and the ministerial system wa introduced . voting took place for the first time on the basis of universal adult suffrage on 9 march 1959 . the general election wa again won by the labour party , led this time by sir seewoosagur ramgoolam .
a constitutional review conference wa held in london in 1961 , and a programme of further constitutional advance wa established . the 1963 election wa won by the labour party and it ally . the colonial office noted that politics of a communal nature wa gaining ground in mauritius and that the choice of candidate ( by party ) and the voting behaviour ( of elector ) were governed by ethnic and caste consideration . around that time , two eminent british academic , richard titmuss and james meade , published a report of the island 's social problem caused by overpopulation and the monoculture of sugar cane . this led to an intense campaign to halt the population explosion , and the decade registered a sharp decline in population growth .
in early 1965 a political assassination took place in the suburb of belle-rose in the town of quatre bornes when labour activist rampersad surath wa beaten to death by thug of rival party parti mauricien . on 10 may 1965 1965 mauritius race riot broke out in the village of trois boutique near souillac , mauritius and progressed to the historic village of mahebourg . a nationwide state of emergency wa declared on the british colony . the riot wa initiated by the murder of police constable beesoo in his vehicle by a creole gang . this wa followed by the murder of a civilian named mr. robert brousse in trois boutique . the creole gang then proceeded to the coastal historic village of mahebourg to assault the indo-mauritian spectator who were watching a hindustani movie at cinma odon . mahebourg police recorded nearly 100 complaint of assault on indo-mauritians .
<section_title_start> independence ( since 1968 )  <section_title_end>
at the lancaster conference of 1965 , it became clear that britain wanted to relieve itself of the colony of mauritius . in 1959 , harold macmillan had made his famous wind of change ( speech ) where he acknowledged that the best option for britain wa to give complete independence to it colony . thus , since the late fifty , the way wa paved for independence .
later in 1965 , after the lancaster conference , the chagos archipelago wa excised from the territory of mauritius to form the british indian ocean territory ( biot ) . a general election took place on 7 august 1967 , and the independence party ( mauritius ) obtained the majority of seat . in january 1968 , six week before the declaration of independence the 1968 mauritian riot occurred in port louis leading to the death of 25 people .
mauritius adopted a new constitution and independence wa proclaimed on 12 march 1968 . sir seewoosagur ramgoolam became the first prime minister of an independent mauritius with queen elizabeth ii remaining head of state a queen of mauritius . in 1969 , the opposition party mauritian militant movement ( mmm ) led by paul brenger wa founded . later in 1971 , the mmm , backed by union , called a series of strike in the port , which caused a state of emergency in the country . the coalition government of the labour party and the pmsd ( parti mauricien social dmocrate ) reacted by curtailing civil liberty and curbing freedom of the press . two unsuccessful assassination attempt were made against paul brenger . on 1 october 1971 his supporter fareed muttur died in suspicious circumstance at le rduit whilst driving paul brenger 's car . the second led to the death of azor adelaide , a dock worker and activist , on 25 november 1971 . general election were postponed and public meeting were prohibited . member of the mmm including paul brenger were imprisoned on 23 december 1971 . the mmm leader wa released a year later .
in may 1975 , a student revolt that started at the university of mauritius swept across the country . the student were unsatisfied with an education system that did not meet their aspiration and gave limited prospect for future employment . on 20 may , thousand of student tried to enter port-louis over the grand river north west bridge and clashed with police . an act of parliament wa passed on 16 december 1975 to extend the right to vote to 18-year-olds . this wa seen a an attempt to appease the frustration of the younger generation .
the next general election took place on 1976 mauritian general election . the labour-cam coalition won only 28 seat out of 62 . the mmm secured 34 seat in parliament but outgoing prime minister sir seewoosagur ramgoolam managed to remain in office , with a two-seat majority , after striking an alliance with the pmsd of gaetan duval .
in 1982 an mauritian militant movement-parti socialiste mauricien government ( led by list of prime minister of mauritius anerood jugnauth , deputy prime minister of mauritius harish boodhoo and finance minister paul brenger ) wa elected . however , ideological and personality difference emerged within the mmm and psm leadership . the power struggle between brenger and jugnauth peaked in march 1983 . jugnauth travelled to new delhi to attend a non-aligned movement summit ; on his return , brenger proposed constitutional change that would strip power from the prime minister . at jugnauth 's request , pm indira gandhi of india planned an armed intervention involving the indian navy and indian army to prevent a coup under the code name operation lal dora .
the mauritian militant movement-parti socialiste mauricien government split up nine month after the june 1982 election . according to an information ministry official the nine month wa a `` socialist experiment '' . harish boodhoo dissolved his party parti socialiste mauricien to enable all psm parliamentarian to join jugnauth 's new party msm , thus remaining in power whilst distancing themselves from mauritian militant movement . the msm-labour-pmsd coalition wa victorious at the 1983 mauritian general election election , resulting in anerood jugnauth a pm and gatan duval a deputy prime minister of mauritius .
that period saw growth in the epz ( export processing zone ) sector . industrialisation began to spread to village a well , and attracted young worker from all ethnic community . a a result , the sugar industry began to lose it hold on the economy . large retail chain began opening store in 1985 and offered credit facility to low-income earner , thus allowing them to afford basic household appliance . there wa also a boom in the tourism industry , and new hotel sprang up throughout the island . in 1989 the stock exchange opened it door and in 1992 the freeport began operation . in 1990 , the list of prime minister of mauritius lost the vote on changing the constitution to make the country a republic with brenger a president .
<section_title_start> republic ( since 1992 )  <section_title_end>

<section_title_start>  chagos archipelago  <section_title_end>
mauritius ha long sought sovereignty over the chagos archipelago , located to the north-east . chagos wa administratively part of mauritius from the 18th century when the french first settled the island . all of the island forming part of the french colonial territory of isle de france ( mauritius ) ( a mauritius wa then known ) were ceded to the british in 1810 under the act of capitulation signed between the two power . in 1965 , three year before the independence of mauritius , the united kingdom split the chagos archipelago from mauritius and the island of aldabra , farquhar group and desroches from the seychelles to form the british indian ocean territory ( biot ) . the island were formally established a an overseas territory of the united kingdom on 8 november 1965 . on 23 june 1976 , aldabra , farquhar and desroches were returned to seychelles a a result of it attaining independence . the biot now comprises the chagos archipelago only . the uk leased the main island of the archipelago , diego garcia , to the united state under a 50-year lease to establish a military base . in 2016 , britain unilaterally extended the lease to the u till 2036 . mauritius ha repeatedly asserted that the separation of it territory is a violation of united nation resolution banning the dismemberment of colonial territory before independence and claim that the chagos archipelago , including diego garcia , form an integral part of the territory of mauritius under both mauritian law and international law . after initially denying that the island were inhabited , british official forcibly expelled to the mainland approximately 2,000 chagossians who had lived on those island for a century . to force the inhabitant to leave , first the british authority cut off food supply , and those who resisted were threatened with being shot or bombed if they did not leave the island . to frighten them , their dog and pet were gassed to death . at the united nation and in statement to it parliament , the uk stated that there wa no `` permanent population '' in the chagos archipelago and described the population a `` contract labourer '' who were relocated . since 1971 , only the atoll of diego garcia is inhabited , home to some 3,000 uk and u military and civilian contracted personnel . chagossians have since engaged in activism to return to the archipelago , claiming that their forced expulsion and dispossession were illegal .
section 111 of the constitution of mauritius state that  mauritius  includes
( a ) the island of mauritius , rodrigues , agalega , tromelin , cargados carajos and the chagos archipelago , including diego garcia and any other island comprised in the state of mauritius ;

<section_title_start>  permanent court of arbitration  <section_title_end>
on 20 december 2010 , mauritius initiated proceeding against the united kingdom under the united nation convention on the law of the sea ( unclos ) to challenge the legality of the chagos marine protected area ( mpa ) , which the uk purported to declare around the chagos archipelago in april 2010 . the dispute wa arbitrated by the permanent court of arbitration .
the sovereignty of mauritius wa explicitly recognized by two of the arbitrator and denied by none of the other three . three member of the tribunal found that they did not have jurisdiction to rule on that question ; they expressed no view a to which of the two state ha sovereignty over the chagos archipelago . tribunal judge rdiger wolfrum and james kateka held that the tribunal did have jurisdiction to decide this question , and concluded that uk doe not have sovereignty over the chagos archipelago . they found that :
* internal united kingdom document suggested an ulterior motive behind the mpa , noting disturbing similarity and a common pattern between the establishment of the so-called `` biot '' in 1965 and the proclamation of the mpa in 2010 ;
* the excision of the chagos archipelago from mauritius in 1965 show a complete disregard for the territorial integrity of mauritius by the uk ;
* uk prime minister harold wilson 's threat to premier sir seewoosagur ramgoolam in 1965 that he could return home without independence if he did not consent to the excision of the chagos archipelago amounted to duress ; mauritian minister were coerced into agreeing to the detachment of the chagos archipelago , which violated the international law of self-determination ;
* the mpa is legally invalid .
the tribunal 's decision determined that the uk 's undertaking to return the chagos archipelago to mauritius give mauritius an interest in significant decision that bear upon possible future us of the archipelago . the result of the tribunal 's decision is that it is now open to the party to enter into the negotiation that the tribunal would have expected prior to the proclamation of the mpa , with a view to achieving a mutually satisfactory arrangement for protecting the marine environment , to the extent necessary under a `` sovereignty umbrella '' .
<section_title_start>  international court of justice  <section_title_end>
<section_title_start> amendment of exclusion clause by uk <section_title_end>
in 2004 , following the decision of the british government to promulgate the british indian ocean territory order , which prohibited the chagossians from remaining on the island without express authorisation , mauritius contemplated recourse to the international court of justice to finally and conclusively settle the dispute . however , article 36 of the international court of justice statute provides that it is the option of the state whether it wish to subject itself to the court 's jurisdiction . where the state chooses to be so bound , it may also restrict or limit the jurisdiction of the court in a number of way . the uk 's clause deposited at the court excluded , amongst other thing , the jurisdiction of the court with regard `` to any dispute with the government of any country which is a member of the commonwealth with regard to situation or fact existing before 1 january 1969 '' . the temporal limitation of 1 january 1969 wa inserted to exclude all dispute arising during decolonisation . the effect of the british exclusionary clause would thus have prevented mauritius from resorting to the court on the chagos dispute because it is a member of the commonwealth of nation . when mauritius threatened to leave the commonwealth , the united kingdom quickly amended it exclusion clause to exclude any dispute between itself , commonwealth state and former commonwealth state , thereby quashing any mauritian hope to ever have recourse to the contentious jurisdiction of the court , even if it left .
<section_title_start> advisory opinion <section_title_end>

on 25 february 2019 , the judge of the international court of justice by thirteen vote to one stated that the united kingdom is under an obligation to bring to an end it administration of the chagos archipelago a rapidly a possible . only the american judge , joan donoghue , voted in favor of the uk . the president of the court , abdulqawi ahmed yusuf , said the detachment of the chagos archipelago in 1965 from mauritius had not been based on a `` free and genuine expression of the people concerned . '' `` this continued administration constitutes a wrongful act , '' he said , adding `` the uk ha an obligation to bring to an end it administration of the chagos archipelago a rapidly a possible and that all member state must co-operate with the united nation to complete the decolonization of mauritius . ''
on 1 may 2019 , the uk foreign office minister alan duncan stated that mauritius ha never held sovereignty over the archipelago and the uk doe not recognise it claim . he stated that the ruling wa merely an advisory opinion and not a legally binding judgment . jeremy corbyn , leader of the uk 's main opposition party , wrote to the uk pm condemning her decision to defy a ruling of the un 's principal court that concluded that britain should hand back the chagos island to mauritius . he expressed his concern that the uk government appears ready to disregard international law and ignore a ruling of the international court and the right of the chagossians to return to their home .
on 22 may 2019 , the united nation general assembly debated and adopted a resolution that affirmed that the chagos archipelago , which ha been occupied by the uk for more than 50 year , `` form an integral part of the territory of mauritius '' . the resolution give effect to an advisory opinion of the international court of justice ( icj ) , demanded that the uk `` withdraw it colonial administration ... unconditionally within a period of no more than six month '' . 116 state voted in favour of the resolution , 55 abstained and only australia , hungary , israel and maldives supported the uk and u . during the debate , the mauritian prime minister described the expulsion of chagossians a `` a crime against humanity '' . while the resolution is not legally binding , it carry significant political weight since the ruling came from the un 's highest court and the assembly vote reflects world opinion . the resolution also ha immediate practical consequence : the un , it specialised agency , and all other international organisation are now bound , a a matter of un law , to support the decolonisation of mauritius even if the uk claim that it ha no doubt about it sovereignty .

<section_title_start>  history  <section_title_end>
<section_title_start> ancient period <section_title_end>
the oldest evidence of [ habitation in jordan date back at least 200,000 year . jordan is rich in paleolithic ] ( up to 20,000 year ago ) remains due to it location within the [ [ levant where expansion of hominid recent african origin of modern human converged . past lakeshore environment attracted different hominid , and several remains of tool have been found from this period . the world 's oldest evidence of bread-making wa found in a 14,500 year old natufian culture site in jordan 's northeastern desert . the transition from [ to establishing populous agricultural village occurred during the neolithic ] period ( 10,0004,500 bc ) . [ [ 'ain ghazal , one such village located in today 's eastern amman , is one of the largest known prehistoric settlement in the near east . dozen of 'ain ghazal statue of the human form dating to 7250 bc or earlier were uncovered there and they are among the oldest ever found . other than the usual chalcolithic ( 45003600 bc ) village such a teleilat el ghassul in the jordan valley ( middle east ) , a series of circular stone enclosure in the eastern basalt desertwhose purpose remains uncertainhave baffled archaeologist .
fortified town and urban center first emerged in the southern levant early on in the bronze age ( 36001200 bc ) . wadi feynan became a regional centre for copper extraction , which wa exploited on a large-scale to produce bronze . trade and movement of people in the middle east peaked , spreading and refining civilization . village in transjordan expanded rapidly in area with reliable water resource and agricultural land . ancient egyptian expanded towards the levant and controlled both bank of the jordan river . during the iron age ( 1200332 bc ) after the withdrawal of the egyptian , transjordan wa home to ammon , edom and moab . they spoke semitic language of the canaanite language , and are considered to be tribal kingdom rather than state . ammon wa located in the amman plateau ; moab in the highland east of the dead sea ; and edom in the area around wadi araba down south .
the transjordan ian kingdom of ammon , edom and moab were in continuous conflict with the neighboring hebrew kingdom of kingdom of israel ( samaria ) and kingdom of judah , centered west of the jordan river . one record of this is the mesha stele erected by the moabite king mesha in 840 bc on which he lauds himself for the building project that he initiated in moab and commemorates his glory and victory against the israelite . the stele constitutes one of the most important direct account of biblical history . around 700 bc , the kingdom benefited from trade between syria and arabia when the neo-assyrian empire increasingly controlled the levant . neo-babylonian empire took over the empire after it disintegration in 627 bc . although the kingdom supported the babylonian against judah in the 597 bc siege of jerusalem ( 597 bc ) , they rebelled against them a decade later . the kingdom were reduced to vassal , which they remained under the achaemenid empire and macedonia ( ancient kingdom ) empire . by the beginning of roman empire around 63 bc , the kingdom of ammon , edom and moab had lost their distinct identity , and were assimilated into the roman culture .
<section_title_start> classical period <section_title_end>
alexander the great 's war of alexander the great of the persian empire in 332 bc introduced hellenistic period culture to the middle east . after alexander 's death in 323 bc , the partition of babylon among his general , and in the end much of transjordan wa disputed between the ptolemaic kingdom based in egypt and the seleucids based in syria . the nabataeans , nomadic arab based south of edom , managed to establish an independent kingdom in 169 bc by exploiting the struggle between the two greek power . the nabataean kingdom controlled much of the trade route of the region , and it stretched south along the red sea coast into the hejaz desert , up to a far north a damascus , which it controlled for a short period ( 8571 ) bc . the nabataeans massed a fortune from their control of the trade route , often drawing the envy of their neighbour . petra , nabataea 's barren capital , flourished in the 1st century ad , driven by it extensive water irrigation system and agriculture . the nabataeans were also talented stone carving , building their most elaborate structure , al-khazneh , in the first century ad . it is believed to be the mausoleum of the arab nabataean king aretas iv philopatris .
roman legion under pompey conquered much of the levant in 63 bc , inaugurating a period of roman rule that lasted four century . in 106 ad , emperor trajan annexed nabataea unopposed , and rebuilt the king 's highway ( ancient ) king 's highway which became known a the via traiana nova road . the roman gave the greek city of transjordanphiladelphia ( amman ) , jerash ( jerash ) , umm qays ( umm quay ) , pella , jordan ( tabaqat fahl ) and irbid ( irbid ) and other hellenistic city in palestine and southern syria , a level of autonomy by forming the decapolis , a ten-city league . jerash is one of the best preserved roman city in the east ; it wa even visited by emperor hadrian during his journey to palestine .
in 324 ad , the roman empire split , and the eastern roman empirelater known a the byzantine empirecontinued to control or influence the region until 636 ad . christianity had become legal within the empire in 313 ad after emperor constantine the great converted to christianity . the edict of thessalonica made christianity the official state religion in 380 ad . transjordan prospered during the byzantine era , and christian church were built everywhere . the aqaba church in aqaba wa built during this era , it is considered to be the list of oldest church building world 's first purpose built christian church . umm ar-rasas in southern amman contains at least 16 byzantine church . meanwhile , petra 's importance declined a sea trade route emerged , and after a galilee earthquake of 363 destroyed many structure , it declined further , eventually being abandoned . the sassanian empire in the east became the byzantine ' rival , and byzantinesasanian war sometimes led to the sassanids controlling some part of the region , including transjordan .
<section_title_start> islamic era <section_title_end>
in 629 ad , during the battle of mu'tah in what is today al-karak , the byzantine and their arab christian client , the ghassanids , staved off an attack by a muslim rashidun force that marched northward towards the levant from the hejaz ( in modern-day saudi arabia ) . the byzantine however were defeated by the muslim in 636 ad at the decisive battle of yarmouk just north of transjordan . transjordan wa an essential territory for the conquest of damascus . the first , or rashidun , caliphate wa followed by that of the ummayad caliphate ( 661750 ) . under the umayyad caliphate , several desert castle were constructed in transjordan , including : qasr al-mshatta and qasr al-hallabat . the abbasid caliphate 's campaign to take over the umayyad 's began in transjordan . a powerful 749 galilee earthquake is thought to have contributed to the umayyad defeat to the abbasids , who moved the caliphate 's capital from damascus to baghdad . during abbasid rule ( 750969 ) , several arab tribe moved northward and settled in the levant . a had happened during the roman era , growth of maritime trade diminished transjordan 's central position , and the area became increasingly impoverished . after the decline of the abbasids , transjordan wa ruled by the fatimid caliphate ( 9691070 ) , then by the crusade kingdom of jerusalem ( 11151187 ) .
the crusader constructed several crusader castle a part of the lordship of oultrejordain , including those of montreal ( crusader castle ) and al-karak . the ayyubids built the ajloun castle and rebuilt older castle , to be used a military outpost against the crusader . during the battle of hattin ( 1187 ) near lake tiberias just north of transjordan , the crusader lost to saladin , the founder of the ayyubid dynasty ( 11871260 ) . village in transjordan under the ayyubids became important stop for muslim pilgrim going to mecca who travelled along the route that connected syria to the hejaz . several of the ayyubid castle were used and expanded by the mamluk sultanate ( cairo ) ( 12601516 ) , who divided transjordan between the province of karak and damascus . during the next century transjordan experienced mongol attack , but the mongol were ultimately repelled by the mamluks after the battle of ain jalut ( 1260 ) .
in 1516 , the ottoman empire 's force ottomanmamluk war ( 151617 ) . agricultural village in transjordan witnessed a period of relative prosperity in the 16th century , but were later abandoned . transjordan wa of marginal importance to the ottoman authority . a a result , ottoman presence wa virtually absent and reduced to annual tax collection visit . more arab bedouin tribe moved into transjordan from syria and the hejaz during the first three century of ottoman rule , including the banu 'adwan , the ban sakhr and the howeitat . these tribe laid claim to different part of the region , and with the absence of a meaningful ottoman authority , transjordan slid into a state of anarchy that continued till the 19th century . this led to a short-lived occupation by the wahhabi force ( 18031812 ) , an ultra-orthodox islamic movement that emerged in emirate of diriyah ( in modern-day saudi arabia ) . ibrahim pasha of egypt , son of the muhammad ali of egypt of the egypt eyalet under the request of the ottoman sultan , ottomanwahhabi war by 1818 . in 1833 ibrahim pasha turned on the ottoman and established his rule over the levant . his oppressive policy led to the unsuccessful peasant ' revolt in palestine in 1834 . transjordanian city of al-salt and al-karak were siege of al-karak ( 1834 ) by ibrahim pasha 's force for harboring a qasim al-ahmad peasant ' revolt leader . egyptian rule wa egyptianottoman war ( 183941 ) in 1841 , with ottoman rule restored .
only after ibrahim pasha 's campaign did the ottoman empire try to solidify it presence in the syria vilayet , which transjordan wa part of . a series of tax and land reform ( tanzimat ) in 1864 brought some prosperity back to agriculture and to abandoned village ; the end of virtually autonomy predictably provoked a backlash in other area of transjordan . muslim circassian and chechen , fleeing russian ethnic cleansing of circassian , sought refuge in the levant . in transjordan and with ottoman support , circassian first settled in the long-abandoned vicinity of amman in 1867 , and later in the surrounding village . after having established it administration , conscription and heavy taxation policy by the ottoman authority led to revolt in the area it controlled . transjordan 's tribe in particular revolted during the shoubak revolt ( 1905 ) and the karak revolt ( 1910 ) , which were brutally suppressed . the construction of the hejaz railway in 1908stretching across the length of transjordan and linking mecca with istanbul helped the population economically , a transjordan became a stopover for pilgrim . however , increasing policy of turkification and centralization adopted by the ottoman empire disenchanted the arab of the levant .
<section_title_start> modern era <section_title_end>
four century of stagnation during ottoman rule came to an end during world war i by the 1916 arab revolt , driven by long-term resentment towards the ottoman authority and growing arab nationalism . the revolt wa led by sharif of mecca hussein bin ali , sharif of mecca of mecca , and his son abdullah i of jordan , faisal i of iraq and ali of hejaz , member of the hashemites of the hejaz , descendant of the prophet muhammad . locally , the revolt garnered the support of the transjordanian tribe , including bedouin , circassian and jordanian christian . the ally of world war ; i , including britain and france , whose imperial interest converged with the arabist cause , offered support . the revolt started on 5 june 1916 from medina and pushed northward until the fighting reached transjordan in the battle of aqaba on 6 july 1917 . the revolt reached it climax when faisal entered damascus in october 1918 , and established an arab-led military administration in occupied enemy territory administration , later declared a the arab kingdom of syria , both of which transjordan wa part of . during this period , the southernmost region of the country , including ma'an and aqaba , wa also occupation of ma'an by the neighbouring kingdom of hejaz .
the nascent hashemite kingdom over greater syria wa forced to surrender to french troop on 24 july 1920 during the battle of maysalun ; the french occupied only the northern part of the syrian kingdom , leaving interregnum ( transjordan ) . arab aspiration failed to gain international recognition , due mainly to the secret 1916 sykespicot agreement , which divided the region into french and british sphere of influence , and the 1917 balfour declaration , which promised palestine to jew . this wa seen by the hashemites and the arab a a betrayal of their previous agreement with the british , including the 1915 mcmahonhussein correspondence , in which the british stated their willingness to recognize the independence of a unified arab state stretching from aleppo to aden under the rule of the hashemites .
the british mandate for palestine ( legal instrument ) high commissioner for palestine and transjordan , herbert samuel , 1st viscount samuel , travelled to transjordan on 21 august 1920 to meet with al-salt 's resident . he there declared to a crowd of six hundred transjordan ian notable that the british government would aid the establishment of local government in transjordan , which is to be kept separate from that of palestine . the second meeting took place in umm qais on 2 september , where the british government representative major fitzroy somerset , 4th baron raglan received a petition that demanded : an independent arab government in transjordan to be led by an arab prince ( emir ) ; land sale in transjordan to jew be stopped a well a the prevention of jewish immigration there ; that britain establish and fund a national army ; and that free trade be maintained between transjordan and the rest of the region .

in september 1922 , the council of the league of nation recognized transjordan a a state under the term of the transjordan memorandum . transjordan remained a british mandate until 1946 , but it had been granted a greater level of autonomy than the region west of the jordan river . multiple difficulty emerged upon the assumption of power in the region by the hashemite leadership . in transjordan , small local rebellion at kura rebellion in 1921 and 1923 were suppressed by the emir 's force with the help of the british . wahabi from najd regained strength and ikhwan raid on transjordan the southern part of his territory in ( 19221924 ) , seriously threatening the emir 's position . the emir wa unable to repel those raid without the aid of the local bedouin tribe and the british , who maintained a military base with a small royal air force detachment close to amman .

jordan is among the most water-scarce nation on earth . at 97 cubic meter of water per person per year , it is considered to face `` absolute water scarcity '' according to the falkenmark classification . scarce resource to begin with have been aggravated by the massive influx of syrian refugee into jordan , many of whom face issue of access to clean water due to living in informal settlement ( see `` immigrant and refugee '' below ) . jordan share both of it two main surface water resource , the jordan river and yarmouk river river , with neighbouring country , adding complexity to water allocation decision . water from disi water conveyance project and ten major dam historically played a large role in providing jordan 's need for fresh water . the jawa dam ( jordan ) in northeastern jordan , which date back to the fourth millennium bc , is the world 's oldest dam . the dead sea is receding at an alarming rate . multiple canal and pipeline were proposed to reduce it recession , which had begun causing sinkhole . the red seadead sea water conveyance project , carried out by jordan , will provide water to the country and to israel and palestine , while the brine will be carried to the dead sea to help stabilise it level . the first phase of the project is scheduled to begin in 2019 and to be completed in 2021.

<section_title_start>  history  <section_title_end>
<section_title_start>  pre-columbian period  <section_title_end>
historian have classified the indigenous people of the america of costa rica a belonging to the intermediate area , where the periphery of the mesoamerican and andean native culture overlapped . more recently , pre-columbian era pre-columbian costa rica ha also been described a part of the isthmo-colombian area .
stone tool , the oldest evidence of human occupation in costa rica , are associated with the arrival of various group of [ about 10,000 to 7,000 year before common era bce ] in the [ [ turrialba ( district ) . the presence of clovis culture type spearhead and arrow from south america open the possibility that , in this area , two different culture coexisted .
agriculture became evident in the population that lived in costa rica about 5,000 year ago . they mainly grew tuber and root . for the first and second millennium bce there were already settled farming community . these were small and scattered , although the timing of the transition from [ and gathering to agriculture a the main livelihood in the territory is still unknown .
the earliest use of pottery ] appears around 2,000 to 3,000 bce . shard of pot , cylindrical vas , platter , gourd and other form of vas decorated with groove , print , and some modelled after animal have been found .
the impact of indigenous people on modern costa rican culture ha been relatively small compared to other nation , since the country lacked a strong native civilization to begin with . most of the native population wa absorbed into the spanish-speaking [ [ spanish colonization of the america through inter-marriage , except for some small remnant , the most significant of which are the bribri people and boruca people tribe who still inhabit the mountain of the cordillera de talamanca , in the southeastern part of costa rica , near the frontier with panama .
<section_title_start>  spanish colonization  <section_title_end>
the name la costa rica , meaning `` rich coast '' in the spanish language , wa in some account first applied by christopher columbus , who sailed to the eastern shore of costa rica during his final voyage in 1502 , and reported vast quantity of gold jewelry worn by native . the name may also have come from conquistador gil gonzlez dvila , who landed on the west coast in 1522 , encountered native , and obtained some of their gold , sometimes by violent theft and sometimes a gift from local leader .
during most of the colonial period , costa rica wa the southernmost province of the captaincy general of guatemala , nominally part of the new spain . in practice , the captaincy general wa a largely autonomous entity within the spanish empire . costa rica 's distance from the capital of the captaincy in guatemala , it legal prohibition under spanish law from trade with it southern neighbor panama , then part of the viceroyalty of new granada ( i.e . colombia ) , and lack of resource such a gold and silver , made costa rica into a poor , isolated , and sparsely-inhabited region within the spanish empire . costa rica wa described a `` the poorest and most miserable spanish colony in all america '' by a spanish governor in 1719.
another important factor behind costa rica 's poverty wa the lack of a significant indigenous population available for encomienda ( forced labor ) , which meant most of the costa rican settler had to work on their own land , preventing the establishment of large [ ( plantation ) . for all these reason , costa rica wa , by and large , unappreciated and overlooked by the habsburg spain spanish crown ] and left to develop on it own . the circumstance during this period are believed to have led to many of the idiosyncrasy for which costa rica ha become known , while concomitantly setting the stage for costa rica 's development a a more egalitarian society than the rest of it neighbor . costa rica became a `` rural democracy '' with no oppressed [ [ mestizo or indigenous class . it wa not long before spanish settler turned to the hill , where they found rich volcanic soil and a milder climate than that of the lowland .

in 1878 , the cape colony , then a british colony , annexed the port of walvis bay and the offshore penguin island ; these became an integral part of the new union of south africa at it creation in 1910 . in 1884 the german empire established rule over most of the territory , forming a colony known a german south west africa . it developed farming and infrastructure . between 1904 and 1908 it perpetrated a herero and namaqua genocide against the herero and nama people . german rule ended in 1915 with a defeat by south african force . in 1920 , after the end of world war i , the league of nation league of nation mandate administration of the colony to south africa . a mandatory power , south africa imposed it law , including racial classification and rule . from 1948 , with the national party ( south africa ) elected to power , this included south africa applying apartheid to what wa then known a south west africa .
in the later 20th century , uprising and demand for political representation by native african political activist seeking independence resulted in the un assuming direct responsibility over the territory in 1966 , but south africa maintained de facto rule . in 1973 the un recognised the south west africa people 's organisation ( swapo ) a the official representative of the namibian people ; the party is dominated by the ovambo , who are a large plurality in the territory . following continued guerrilla warfare , south africa installed an interim administration in namibia in 1985 . namibia obtained full independence from south africa in 1990 . however , walvis bay and the penguin island remained under south african control until 1994.
namibia ha a population of 2.6 ; million people and a stable multi-party system multi-party parliamentary democracy . agriculture , tourism in namibia and the mining in namibia ;  including mining for gem diamond , uranium mining , gold mining , silver mining and base metal ;  form the basis of it economy of namibia , while the manufacturing sector is comparatively small . the large , arid namib desert from which the country derived it name ha resulted in namibia being overall one of the list of country and territory by population density country in the world .
<section_title_start> etymology <section_title_end>
the name of the country is derived from the namib desert , the oldest desert in the world . the name namib itself is of nama language origin and mean `` vast place '' . before it independence in 1990 , the area wa known first a german south-west africa ( deutsch-sdwestafrika ) , then a south-west africa , reflecting the colonial occupation by the german and the south african .
<section_title_start> history <section_title_end>
<section_title_start> pre-colonial period <section_title_end>
the dry land of namibia have been inhabited since early time by san , damara , and nama . around the 14th century , immigrating bantu people began to arrive during the bantu expansion from central africa .
from the late 18th century onward , oorlam people from cape colony crossed the orange river and moved into the area that today is southern namibia . their encounter with the nomadic nama tribe were largely peaceful . they received the missionary accompanying the oorlam very well , granting them the right to use waterholes and grazing against an annual payment . on their way further north , however , the oorlam encountered clan of the ovaherero people at windhoek , gobabis , and okahandja , who resisted their encroachment . the nama-herero war broke out in 1880 , with hostility ebbing only after the german empire deployed troop to the contested place and cemented the status quo among the nama , oorlam , and herero .
the first european to disembark and explore the region were the portuguese navigator diogo co in 1485 and bartolomeu dia in 1486 , but the portuguese did not try to claim the area . like most of interior sub-saharan africa , namibia wa not extensively explored by european until the 19th century . at that time trader and settler came principally from germany and sweden . in the late 19th century , dorsland trekker crossed the area on their way from the south african republic to angola . some of them settled in namibia instead of continuing their journey .
<section_title_start> german rule <section_title_end>
namibia became a german colony in 1884 under otto von bismarck to forestall perceived british encroachment and wa known a german south west africa ( deutsch-sdwestafrika ) . the palgrave commission by the british governor in cape town determined that only the natural deep-water harbour of walvis bay wa worth occupying and thus annexed it to the cape province of british south africa .
from 1904 to 1907 , the herero people and the nama people herero war against brutal german colonialism . in a calculated punitive action by the german occupier , government official ordered extinction of the native in the herero and namaqua genocide . in what ha been called the `` first genocide of the 20th century '' , the german systematically killed 10,000 nama ( half the population ) and approximately 65,000 herero ( about 80 % of the population ) . the survivor , when finally released from detention , were subjected to a policy of dispossession , deportation , forced labour , racial segregation , and discrimination in a system that in many way anticipated the apartheid established by south africa in 1948.
most african were confined to so-called native territory , which under south african rule after 1949 were turned into `` homeland '' ( bantustans ) . some historian have speculated that the german genocide in namibia wa a model for the nazism in the holocaust . the memory of genocide remains relevant to ethnic identity in independent namibia and to relation with germany . the german government formally apologised for the namibian genocide in 2004.
<section_title_start> south african mandate <section_title_end>
during world war i , south african troop under general louis botha south west africa campaign and deposed the german colonial administration . the end of the war and the treaty of versailles resulted in south west africa remaining a possession of south africa a a league of nation mandate until 1990 . the mandate system wa formed a a compromise between those who advocated for an allied annexation of former german and turkish territory and a proposition put forward by those who wished to grant them to an international trusteeship until they could govern themselves . it permitted the south african government to administer south west africa until that territory 's inhabitant were prepared for political self-determination . south africa interpreted the mandate a a veiled annexation and made no attempt to prepare south west africa for future autonomy .
a a result of the united nation conference on international organization in 1945 , the league of nation wa formally superseded by the united nation ( un ) and former league mandate by a trusteeship system . article 77 of the united nation charter stated that un trusteeship `` shall apply ... to territory now held under mandate '' ; furthermore , it would `` be a matter of subsequent agreement a to which territory in the foregoing territory will be brought under the trusteeship system and under what term '' . the un requested all former league of nation mandate be surrendered to it united nation trusteeship council in anticipation of their independence . south africa declined to do so and instead requested permission from the un to formally annexe south west africa , for which it received considerable criticism . when the un general assembly rejected this proposal , south africa dismissed it opinion and began solidifying control of the territory . the un generally assembly and security council responded by referring the issue to the international court of justice ( icj ) , which held a number of discussion on the legality of south african rule between 1949 and 1966.
south africa began imposing apartheid , it codified system of racial segregation and discrimination , on south west africa during the late 1940s . black south west african were subject to pas law , curfew , and a host of draconian residential regulation that heavily restricted their movement . development wa concentrated in the region of the country immediately adjacent to south africa , formally called the `` police zone '' , where most of the german colonial era settlement and mine were . outside the police zone , indigenous people were restricted to theoretically self-governing bantustan .
during the late 1950s and early 1960s , pressure for global decolonisation and national self-determination began mounting on the african continent ; these factor had a radical impact on south west african nationalism . early nationalist organisation such a the south west african national union ( swanu ) and south west african people 's organisation ( swapo ) made determined attempt to establish indigenous political structure for an independent south west africa . in 1966 , following the icj 's controversial ruling that it had no legal standing to consider the question of south african rule , swapo launched an armed insurgency that escalated into part of a wider regional conflict known a the south african border war .
<section_title_start> independence <section_title_end>
a swapo 's insurgency intensified , south africa 's case for annexation in the international community continued to decline . the un declared that south africa had failed in it obligation to ensure the moral and material well-being of south west africa 's indigenous inhabitant and had thus disavowed it own mandate . on 12 june 1968 , the un general assembly adopted a resolution proclaiming that , in accordance with the desire of it people , south west africa be renamed namibia . united nation security council resolution 269 , adopted in august 1969 , declared south africa 's continued occupation of namibia illegal . in recognition of this landmark decision , swapo 's armed wing wa renamed the people 's liberation army of namibia ( plan ) .
namibia became one of several flashpoint for cold war proxy conflict in southern africa during the latter year of the plan insurgency . the insurgent sought out weapon and sent recruit to the soviet union for military training . swapo 's political leadership , dependent on military aid from the soviet , cuba , and angola , positioned the movement within the socialist bloc by 1975 . this practical alliance reinforced the prevailing perspective of swapo a a soviet proxy , which dominated cold war ideology in south africa and the united state . for it part , the soviet union supported swapo partly because it viewed south africa a a regional western ally .
growing war weariness and the reduction of tension between the superpower compelled south africa , angola , and cuba to accede to the tripartite accord ( angola ) , under pressure from both the soviet union and the united state . south africa accepted namibian independence in exchange for cuban military withdrawal from the region and an angolan commitment to cease all aid to plan . plan and south africa adopted an informal ceasefire in august 1988 , and a united nation transition assistance group ( untag ) wa formed to monitor the namibian peace process and supervise the return of refugee . the ceasefire wa broken after plan made a final incursion into the territory , possibly a a result of misunderstanding untag 's directive , in march 1989 . a new ceasefire wa later imposed with the condition that the insurgent were to be confined to their external base in angola until they could be disarmed and demobilised by untag .
by the end of the 11-month transition period , the last south african troop had been withdrawn from namibia , all political prisoner granted amnesty , racially discriminatory legislation repealed , and 42,000 namibian refugee returned to their home . just over 97 % of eligible voter participated in the country 's first namibian parliamentary election , 1989 held under a universal franchise . the united nation plan included oversight by election monitoring in an effort to ensure a election # difficulty with election . swapo won a plurality of seat in the member of the constituent assembly of namibia with 57 % of the popular vote . this gave the party 41 seat , but not a two-thirds majority , which would have enabled it to draft the constitution on it own .
the namibian constitution wa adopted in february 1990 . it incorporated protection for human right and compensation for state expropriation of private property , and established an independent judiciary , legislature , and an executive presidency ( the constituent assembly became the national assembly ) . the country officially became independent on 21 march 1990 . sam nujoma wa sworn in a the first president of namibia at a ceremony attended by nelson mandela of south africa ( who had been released from prison the previous month ) and representative from 147 country , including 20 head of state . in 1994 , following the first multiracial election in south africa , that country ceded walvis bay to namibia .
<section_title_start> after independence <section_title_end>
since independence namibia ha completed the transition from white minority apartheid rule to parliamentary democracy . multiparty democracy wa introduced and ha been maintained , with local , regional and election in namibia held regularly . several registered political party are active and represented in the national assembly , although the swapo ha won every election since independence . the transition from the 15-year rule of president sam nujoma to his successor hifikepunye pohamba in 2005 went smoothly .
since independence , the namibian government ha promoted a policy of national reconciliation . it issued an amnesty for those who fought on either side during the liberation war . the civil war in angola spilled over and adversely affected namibian living in the north of the country . in 1998 , namibia defence force ( ndf ) troop were sent to the democratic republic of the congo a part of a southern african development community ( sadc ) contingent .
in 1999 , the national government quashed a secessionist attempt in the northeastern caprivi strip . the caprivi conflict wa initiated by the caprivi liberation army ( cla ) , a rebellion group led by mishake muyongo . it wanted the caprivi strip to secede and form it own society .
<section_title_start> geography <section_title_end>
at , namibia is the world 's thirty-fourth largest country ( after venezuela ) . it lie mostly between latitude 17th parallel south 17 and 29th parallel south 29 ( a small area is north of 17 ) , and longitude 11th meridian east 11 and 26th meridian east 26e .
being situated between the namib and the kalahari desert desert , namibia ha the least rainfall of any country in sub-saharan africa .
the namibian landscape consists generally of five geographical area , each with characteristic abiotic component and vegetation , with some variation within and overlap between them : the central plateau , the namib , the great escarpment , southern africa , the bushveld , and the kalahari desert .
the central plateau run from north to south , bordered by the skeleton coast to the northwest , the namib desert and it coastal plain to the southwest , the orange river to the south , and the kalahari desert to the east . the central plateau is home to the highest point in namibia at knigstein , namibia elevation .
the namib is a broad expanse of hyper-arid gravel plain and dune that stretch along namibia 's entire coastline . it varies between 100 ; km ( 60 mile ) and 200 ; km ( 120 mile ) in width . area within the namib include the skeleton coast and the kaokoveld in the north and the extensive namib sand sea along the central coast .
the great escarpment swiftly rise to over . average temperature and temperature range increase further inland from the cold atlantic water , while the lingering coastal fog slowly diminish . although the area is rocky with poorly developed soil , it is significantly more productive than the namib desert . a summer wind are forced over the escarpment , moisture is extracted a precipitation .
the bushveld is found in north-eastern namibia along the angolan border and in the caprivi strip . the area receives a significantly greater amount of precipitation than the rest of the country , averaging around per year . the area is generally flat and the soil sandy , limiting their ability to retain water and support agriculture .
the kalahari desert , an arid region that extends into south africa and botswana , is one of namibia 's well-known geographical feature . the kalahari , while popularly known a a desert , ha a variety of localised environment , including some verdant and technically non-desert area . the succulent karoo is home to over 5,000 specie of plant , nearly half of them endemism ; approximately 10 percent of the world 's succulent are found in the karoo . the reason behind this high productivity and endemism may be the relatively stable nature of precipitation .
namibia 's coastal desert is one of the oldest desert in the world . it sand dune , created by the strong onshore wind , are the highest in the world . because of the location of the shoreline , at the point where the atlantic 's cold water reach africa 's hot climate , often extremely dense fog form along the coast . near the coast there are area where the dune-hummocks are vegetated . namibia ha rich coastal and marine resource that remain largely unexplored .
<section_title_start> climate <section_title_end>
namibia extends from 17 to 25 latitude : climatically the range of the sub-tropical high pressure belt . it overall climate description is arid , descending from the sub-humid [ mean rain above ] through semi-arid [ between ] ( embracing most of the waterless kalahari ) and arid [ from ] ( these three region are inland from the western great escarpment , southern africa ) to the hyper-arid coastal plain [ le than ] . temperature maximum are limited by the overall elevation of the entire region : only in the far south , warmbad , namibia for instance , are maximum above recorded .
typically the sub-tropical high pressure belt , with frequent clear sky , provides more than 300 day of sunshine per year . it is situated at the southern edge of the tropic ; the tropic of capricorn cut the country about in half . the winter ( june ;  august ) is generally dry . both rainy season occur in summer : the small rainy season between september and november , the big one between february and april . humidity is low , and average rain varies from almost zero in the skeleton coast to more than in the caprivi strip . rainfall is highly variable , and drought are common . in the summer of 2006/07 the rainfall wa recorded far below the annual average . in may 2019 , namibia declared a state of emergency in response to the drought , and extended it by additional 6 month in october 2019.
weather and climate in the coastal area are dominated by the cold , north-flowing benguela current of the atlantic ocean , which account for very low precipitation ( meteorology ) ( per year or le ) , frequent dense fog , and overall lower temperature than in the rest of the country . in winter , occasionally a condition known a bergwind ( german for `` mountain breeze '' ) or oosweer ( afrikaans for `` east weather '' ) occurs , a hot dry wind blowing from the inland to the coast . a the area behind the coast is a desert , these wind can develop into sand storm , leaving sand deposit in the atlantic ocean that are visible on satellite image .
the central plateau and kalahari area have wide diurnal temperature variation temperature range of up to 30 ; c ( 86 ; f ) .
efundja , the annual seasonal flooding of the northern part of the country , often cause not only damage to infrastructure but loss of life . the rain that cause these flood originate in angola , flow into namibia 's cuvelai-etosha basin , and fill the oshanas ( oshiwambo : flood plain ) there . the worst flood occurred in march 2011 and displaced 21,000 people .
<section_title_start> water sources <section_title_end>
namibia is the driest country in sub-saharan africa and depends largely on groundwater . with an average rainfall of about per annum , the highest rainfall occurs in the caprivi strip in the northeast ( about per annum ) and decrease in a westerly and southwesterly direction to a little a and le per annum at the coast . the only perennial river are found on the national border with south africa , angola , zambia , and the short border with botswana in the caprivi strip . in the interior of the country , surface water is available only in the summer month when river are in flood after exceptional rainfall . otherwise , surface water is restricted to a few large storage dam retaining and damming up these seasonal flood and their run-off . where people do not live near perennial river or make use of the storage dam , they are dependent on groundwater . even isolated community and those economic activity located far from good surface water source , such a mining , agriculture , and tourism , can be supplied from groundwater over nearly 80 % of the country .
more than 100,000 boreholes have been drilled in namibia over the past century . one third of these boreholes have been drilled dry . an aquifer called ohangwena ii , on both side of the angola-namibia border , wa discovered in 2012 . it ha been estimated to be capable of supplying a population of 800,000 people in the north for 400 year , at the current ( 2018 ) rate of consumption . expert estimate that namibia ha of underground water .
<section_title_start> communal wildlife conservancies <section_title_end>

<section_title_start> economy <section_title_end>
namibia 's economy is tied closely to economy of south africa  s due to their shared history . the largest economic sector are mining ( 10.4 % of the gross domestic product in 2009 ) , agriculture ( 5.0 % ) , manufacturing ( 13.5 % ) , and tourism .
namibia ha a highly developed banking sector with modern infrastructure , such a online banking and cellphone banking . the bank of namibia ( bon ) is the central bank of namibia responsible for performing all other function ordinarily performed by a central bank . there are 5 bon authorised commercial bank in namibia : bank windhoek , first national bank , nedbank , standard bank and small and medium enterprise bank .

in 2004 a labour act wa passed to protect people from job discrimination stemming from pregnancy and hiv/aids status . in early 2010 the government tender board announced that `` henceforth 100 per cent of all unskilled and semi-skilled labour must be sourced , without exception , from within namibia '' .
in 2013 , global business and financial news provider , bloomberg l.p. , named namibia the top emerging market economy in africa and the 13th best in the world . only four african country made the top 20 emerging market list in the march 2013 issue of bloomberg market magazine , and namibia wa rated ahead of morocco ( 19th ) , south africa ( 15th ) and zambia ( 14th ) . worldwide , namibia also fared better than hungary , brazil and mexico . bloomberg market magazine ranked the top 20 based on more than a dozen criterion . the data came from bloomberg 's own financial-market statistic , imf forecast and the world bank . the country were also rated on area of particular interest to foreign investor : the ease of doing business , the perceived level of corruption and economic freedom . to attract foreign investment , the government ha made improvement in reducing red tape resulted from excessive government regulation , making namibia one of the least bureaucratic place to do business in the region . facilitation payment are occasionally demanded by custom due to cumbersome and costly custom procedure . namibia is also classified a an upper middle income country by the world bank , and rank 87th out of 185 economy in term of ease of doing business .
the cost of living in namibia is relatively high because most good , including cereal , need to be imported . it capital city , windhoek , is the 150th most expensive place in the world for expatriate to live .
taxation in namibia includes personal income tax , which is applicable to total taxable income of an individual . all individual are taxed at progressive marginal rate over a series of income bracket . the value added tax ( vat ) is applicable to most of the commodity and service .
despite the remote nature of much of the country , namibia ha seaport , airport , highway , and rail transport in namibia ( narrow-gauge ) . it seek to become a regional transportation hub ; it ha an important seaport and several landlocked neighbour . the central plateau already serf a a transportation corridor from the more densely populated north to south africa , the source of four-fifths of namibia 's import .
<section_title_start>  income disparity  <section_title_end>
namibia is a country with a substantial income disparity . the data indicates that the current income share held by the highest 10 % is approximately 51.8 % . this disparity illustrates the large gap between the rich and the poor . an additional figure describes the poverty gap : people living on u $ 2 or le in the country are approximately 17.72 % of the population .
<section_title_start> agriculture <section_title_end>
about half of the population depends on agriculture ( largely subsistence agriculture ) for it livelihood , but namibia must still import some of it food . although per caput gdp is five time the per caput gdp of africa 's poorest country , the majority of namibia 's people live in rural area and have a subsistence way of life . namibia ha one of the list of country by income equality in the world , due in part to the fact that there is an urban economy and a more rural cashless economy . the inequality figure thus take into account people who do not actually rely on the formal economy for their survival . although arable land account for only 1 % of namibia , nearly half of the population is employed in agriculture .
about 4,000 , mostly white , commercial farmer own almost half of namibia 's arable land . the government of germany and the united kingdom will finance namibia 's land reform process , a namibia plan to start expropriating land from white farmer to resettle landless black namibian .
agreement ha been reached on the privatisation of several more enterprise in coming year , with hope that this will stimulate much needed foreign investment , but reinvestment of environmentally derived capital ha hobbled namibian per caput income . one of the fastest growing area of economic development in namibia is the growth of communal wildlife conservancy in namibia . these are particularly important to the rural , generally unemployed , population .
<section_title_start> mining and electricity <section_title_end>
providing 25 % of namibia 's revenue , mining is the single most important contributor to the economy . namibia is the fourth largest exporter of non-fuel mineral in africa and the world 's fourth largest producer of uranium . there ha been significant investment in uranium mining and namibia is set to become the largest exporter of uranium by 2015 . rich alluvium diamond deposit make namibia a primary source for gem-quality diamond . while namibia is known predominantly for it gem diamond and uranium deposit , a number of other mineral are extracted industrially such a lead , tungsten , gold , tin , fluorspar , manganese , marble , copper and zinc . there are offshore gas deposit in the atlantic ocean that are planned to be extracted in the future . according to `` the diamond investigation '' , a book about the global diamond market , from 1978 , de beer , the largest diamond company , bought most of the namibian diamond , and would continue to do so , because `` whatever government eventually come to power they will need this revenue to survive '' .
domestic supply voltage is 220 v ac . electricity is generated mainly by thermal and hydroelectric power plant . non-conventional method of electricity generation also play some role . encouraged by the rich uranium deposit the namibian government plan to erect it first nuclear power station by 2018 , also uranium enrichment is envisaged to happen locally .
<section_title_start> diamonds <section_title_end>

<section_title_start> history <section_title_end>
<section_title_start> early history <section_title_end>
the oldest trace of human existence in the area of present-day liechtenstein date back to the middle paleolithic era . neolithic farming settlement appeared in the valley around 5300 bc .
the hallstatt culture and la tne culture flourished during the late iron age , from around 450 bcpossibly under some influence of both the ancient greek and etruscan civilization civilisation . one of the most important tribal group in the alpine region were the helvetii . in 58 bc , at the battle of bibracte , julius caesar defeated the alpine tribe , thereby bringing the region under close control of the roman republic . by 15 bc , tiberius  later the second roman emperor  with his brother , nero claudius drusus , conquered the entirety of the alpine area . liechtenstein then became integrated into the roman province of raetia . the area wa maintained by the imperial roman army , which maintained large legionary camp at bregenz ( austria ) , near lake constance , and at maienfeld ( swiss ) . the roman built and maintained a roman road which ran through the territory . circa ad 260 brigantium wa destroyed by the alemanni , a germanic people who settled in the area in around ad 450.
in the early middle age , the alemanni settled the eastern swiss plateau by the 5th century and the valley of the alp by the end of the 8th century , with liechtenstein located at the eastern edge of alamannia . in the 6th century the entire region became part of the frankish empire following clovis i clovis ; i 's victory over the alemanni at tolbiac in ad 504.
the area that later became liechtenstein remained under frankish hegemony ( merovingian and carolingian empire dynasty ) until the treaty of verdun divided the carolingian empire in ad 843 , following the death of charlemagne in 814 . the territory of present-day liechtenstein formed part of east francia . it would later be reunified with middle francia under the holy roman empire , around ad 1000 . until about 1100 the predominant language of the area wa romansh language , but thereafter german language began to gain ground in the territory . in 1300 another alemannic population  the walsers , who originated in valais  entered the region and settled ; the mountain village of triesenberg still preserve today feature of walser german .
<section_title_start> foundation of a dynasty <section_title_end>
by 1200 , dominion across the alpine plateau were controlled by the house of house of savoy , zhringer , habsburg , and house of kyburg . other region were accorded the imperial immediacy that granted the empire direct control over the mountain pass . when the kyburg dynasty fell in 1264 , the habsburg under rudolph i of habsburg ( holy roman emperor in 1273 ) extended their territory to the eastern alpine plateau that included the territory of liechtenstein . this region wa feoffment to the hohenems until the sale to the liechtenstein dynasty in 1699.
in 1396 vaduz ( the southern region of liechtenstein ) gained imperial immediacy , i.e . it became subject to the holy roman emperor alone .
the family , from which the principality take it name , originally came from liechtenstein castle in lower austria which they had possessed from at least 1140 until the 13th century ( and again from 1807 onwards ) . the liechtenstein acquired land , predominantly in moravia , lower austria , silesia , and duchy of styria . a these territory were all held in fee ( feudal tenure ) from more senior feudal lord , particularly various branch of the house of habsburg , the liechtenstein dynasty wa unable to meet a primary requirement to qualify for a seat in the imperial diet ( parliament ) , the imperial diet ( holy roman empire ) . even though several liechtenstein prince served several habsburg ruler a close adviser , without any territory held directly from the imperial throne , they held little power in the holy roman empire .
for this reason , the family sought to acquire land that would be classed a unmittelbar ( not sellable ) or held without any intermediate feudal tenure , directly from the holy roman emperor . during the early 17th century karl i , prince of liechtenstein wa made a frst ( prince ) by the holy roman emperor matthias , holy roman emperor after siding with him in a political battle . hans-adam i , prince of liechtenstein hans-adam i wa allowed to purchase the minuscule herrschaft ( `` lordship '' ) of schellenberg and county of vaduz ( in 1699 and 1712 respectively ) from the hohenems . tiny schellenberg and vaduz had exactly the political status required : no feudal lord other than their count sovereign and the suzerainty emperor .

<section_title_start>  etymology  <section_title_end>
according to local historiography , brunei wa founded by awang alak betatar , later to be muhammad shah of brunei , reigning around ad 1400 . he moved from garang in the temburong district to the brunei river estuary , discovering brunei . according to legend , upon landing he exclaimed , baru nah ( loosely translated a `` that 's it ! '' or `` there '' ) , from which the name `` brunei '' wa derived . he wa the first muslim ruler of brunei . before the rise of the bruneian empire under the muslim bolkiah dynasty , brunei is believed to have been under buddhist ruler .
it wa renamed `` barunai '' in the 14th century , possibly influenced by the sanskrit word `` '' (  ) , meaning `` seafarer '' . the word `` borneo '' is of the same origin . in the country 's full name , negara brunei darussalam , darussalam (   ) mean `` abode of peace '' , while negara mean `` country '' in malay language .
the earliest recorded documentation by the west about brunei is by an italian known a ludovico di varthema , who also said the `` bruneian people have fairer skin tone than the people he met in maluku island '' . on his documentation back to 1550 ;
we arrived at the island of bornei ( brunei or borneo ) , which is distant from the maluch about , and we found that it wa somewhat larger than the aforesaid and much lower . the people are pagan and are men of goodwill . their colour is whiter than that of the other sort ; ... in this island justice is well administered ; ...

<section_title_start>  early history  <section_title_end>
the settlement known a vijayapura wa a colony to the buddhist srivijaya empire and wa thought to be located in borneo 's northwest which flourished in the 7th century . in the aftermath of the indian chola invasion of srivijaya , datu puti lead some dissident datus from sumatra and borneo in a rebellion against rajah makatunao who wa a chola appointed local rajah . the dissident and their retinue tried to revive srivijaya in a new country called kedatuan of madja-as madja-as in the visayas island ( an archipelago named after srivijaya ) in the philippine . one of the earliest chinese record of an independent kingdom in borneo is the 977 ad letter to the chinese emperor from the ruler of boni , which some scholar believe to refer to borneo . in 1225 , the chinese official zhao rukuo reported that boni had 100 warship to protect it trade , and that there wa great wealth in the kingdom .
in the 14th century , the javanese manuscript nagarakretagama , written by mpu prapanca in 1365 , mentioned barune a the constituent state of hindu majapahit , which had to make an annual tribute of 40 catty of camphor . in 1369 , sulu which wa also formerly part of majapahit , had successfully rebelled and then attacked boni , looting it of treasure and gold . a fleet from majapahit succeeded in driving away the sulus , but boni wa left weaker after the attack . a chinese report from 1371 described boni a poor and totally controlled by majapahit .
during the 15th century , boni had seceded from majapahit and then converted to islam . thus transforming into the independent sultanate of brunei . brunei became a hashemite state when she allowed the arab emir of mecca , sharif ali , to become her third sultan . scholar claim that the power of the sultanate of brunei wa at bruneian empire between the 15th and 17th century , with it power extending from northern borneo to the southern philippine ( sulu ) and even in the northern philippine ( manila ) which brunei incorporated via territorial acquisition accomplished through royal marriage . sultan bolkiah had extended brunei 's power to it greatest extent when it conquered manila and sulu a he even attempted but failed to conquer the visayas island even though sultan bolkiah wa half-visayan himself being descended from a visayan mother and he wa famously known a sultan ragam `` the singing captain '' , his powerful musical voice wa a trait he inherited from his visayan lineage since visayan were culturally obsessed with singing , with the best madja-as . however , islamic brunei 's power wa not uncontested in borneo since it had a hindu rival in a state founded by indian called kutai in the south which they overpowered but did n't destroy . brunei 's dominance in the philippine wa also challenged by two indianized kingdom , the rajahanates of rajahnate of cebu and rajahnate of butuan which were also coincidentally allied with kutai and were also at war with brunei 's dependency ; sulu and manila a well a their mutual ally , the sultanate of maguindanao . the kedatuans of madja-as and dapitan were also belligerent against brunei due to them being the target of constant muslim attack organized from maguindanao and sultanate of ternate , a papuan speaking state in the vicinity of oceania that grew wealthy by monopolizing spice production . nevertheless , by the 16th century , islam wa firmly rooted in brunei , and the country had built one of it biggest mosque . in 1578 , alonso beltrn , a spanish traveller , described it a being five story tall and built on the water .
<section_title_start>  war with spain and decline  <section_title_end>
brunei briefly rose to prominence in southeast asia when the portuguese occupied malacca and thereby forced the wealthy and powerful but displaced muslim refugee there to relocate to nearby sultanate such a sultanate of aceh and brunei . however , colonialism gradually brought an end to the regional power , a brunei entered a period of decline compounded by internal strife over royal succession . in the face of these invasion by european christian power , the ottoman empire aided the beleaguered southeast asian sultanate by making ottoman expedition to aceh a protectorate and sending expedition to reinforce , train and equip the local mujahideen . spain castille war in 1578 , planning to attack and capture kota batu , brunei-muara , brunei 's capital at the time . this wa based in part on the assistance of two bruneian pengiran # brunei , pengiran seri lela and pengiran seri ratna . the former had travelled to manila , then the centre of the spanish colony . manila itself wa captured from brunei , christianised and made a territory of the viceroyalty of new spain which wa centered in mexico city . pengiran seri lela came to offer brunei a a tributary state to spain for help to recover the throne usurped by his brother , saiful rijal . the spanish agreed that if they succeeded in conquering brunei , pengiran seri lela would be appointed a the sultan , while pengiran seri ratna would be the new bendahara .
in march 1578 , a fresh spanish fleet had arrived from mexico and settled at the philippine , they were led by francisco de sande , acting a capitn-general , he organised an expedition from manila for brunei . the expedition consisted of 400 spaniard and mexican , 1,500 filipino people native and 300 bornean . the campaign wa one of many , which also included action in mindanao and sulu archipelago . the racial make-up of the christian side wa diverse since it were usually made up of mestizo , mulatto and amerindian ( aztec , mayan and incan ) who were gathered and sent from mexico and were led by spanish officer who had worked together with native filipino in military campaign across the southeast asia . the muslim side though wa also equally racially diverse . in addition to the native malay warrior , the ottoman had repeatedly sent military expedition to nearby ottoman expedition to aceh . the expedition were composed mainly of turkic people , egyptian , swahili people , somali , sindhi , gujarati and malabars . these expeditionary force had also spread to other nearby sultanate such a brunei and had taught new fighting tactic and technique on how to forge cannon . the spanish decided to abandon brunei and returned to manila on 26 june 1578 , after 72 day . before doing so , they burned the mosque , a high structure with a five-tier roof .
pengiran seri lela died in august or september 1578 , probably from the same illness suffered by his spanish ally . there wa suspicion that he the legitimate sultan could have been poisoned by the ruling sultan . seri lela 's daughter , a bruneian princess , `` putri '' , had left with the spanish , she abandoned her claim to the crown and then she married a christian tagalog people , named agustn de legazpi de tondo .
the local brunei account of the castilian war differ greatly from the generally accepted view of event . what wa called the castilian war wa seen a a heroic episode , with the spaniard being driven out by bendahara sakam , purportedly a brother of the ruling sultan , and a thousand native warrior . most historian consider this to be a folk-hero account , which probably developed decade or century after .
brunei eventually descended into anarchy . the country suffered a brunei civil war from 1660 to 1673.
<section_title_start>  british intervention  <section_title_end>
the british have intervened in the affair of brunei on several occasion . britain attacked brunei in july 1846 due to internal conflict over who wa the rightful sultan .

sultan hashim jalilul alam aqamaddin appealed to the british to stop further encroachment by the brooke . the `` treaty of protection '' wa negotiated by sir hugh low and signed into effect on 17 september 1888 . the treaty said that the sultan `` could not cede or lease any territory to foreign power without british consent '' ; it provided united kingdom effective control over brunei 's external affair , making it a british protected state ( which continued until 1984 ) . but , when the kingdom of sarawak annexed brunei 's limbang division in 1890 , the british did not take any action to stop it . they did not regard either brunei or the kingdom of sarawak a 'foreign ' ( per the treaty of protection ) . this final annexation by sarawak left brunei with it current small land mass and separation into two part .
british resident were introduced in brunei under the supplementary protectorate agreement in 1906 . the resident were to advise the sultan on all matter of administration . over time , the resident assumed more executive control than the sultan . the residential system ended in 1959.

the name of turkmenistan ( trkmenistan ) can be divided into two component : the ethnonym turkmen and the persian language suffix -stan meaning `` place of '' or `` country '' . the name `` turkmen '' come from turk , plus the sogdian language suffix -men , meaning `` almost turk '' , in reference to their status outside the turkic dynastic mythological system . however , some scholar argue the suffix is an intensifier , changing the meaning of trkmen to `` pure turk '' or `` the turkish turk . ''

<section_title_start>  history  <section_title_end>
historically inhabited by the indo-iranian , the written history of turkmenistan begin with it annexation by the achaemenid empire of ancient iran . in the 8th century ad , turkic languages-speaking oghuz turk tribe moved from mongolia into present-day central asia . part of a powerful confederation of tribe , these oghuz formed the ethnic basis of the modern turkmen population . in the 10th century , the name `` turkmen '' wa first applied to oghuz group that accepted islam and began to occupy present-day turkmenistan . there they were under the dominion of the seljuk empire , which wa composed of oghuz group living in present-day iran and turkmenistan . oghuz group in the service of the empire played an important role in the spreading of turkic culture when they migrated westward into present-day azerbaijan and eastern turkey .
in the 12th century , turkmen and other tribe overthrew the seljuk empire . in the next century , the mongol took over the more northern land where the turkmen had settled , scattering the turkmen southward and contributing to the formation of new tribal group . the sixteenth and eighteenth century saw a series of split and confederation among the nomadic turkmen tribe , who remained staunchly independent and inspired fear in their neighbor . by the 16th century , most of those tribe were under the nominal control of two sedentary uzbek khanate , khanate of khiva and khanate of bukhara . turkmen soldier were an important element of the uzbek military of this period . in the 19th century , raid and rebellion by the yomud turkmen group resulted in that group 's dispersal by the uzbek ruler . in 1855 the turkmen tribe of teke ( turkmen tribe ) led by gowshut-khan defeated the invading army of the khanate of khiva muhammad amin khan and in 1861 the invading persian army of naser al-din shah qajar nasreddin-shah .
in the 2nd half of the 19th century , northern turkmen were the main military and political power in the khanate of khiva . according to paul r. spickard , `` prior to the russian conquest , the turkmen were known and feared for their involvement in the central asian history of slavery in asia . ''
russian force began occupying turkmen territory late in the 19th century . from their caspian sea base at krasnovodsk ( now trkmenbay , turkmenistan ) , the russian eventually overcame the uzbek khanate . in 1879 , the russian force were defeated by the teke ( turkmen tribe ) during the battle of geok tepe ( 1879 ) . however , in 1881 , the last significant resistance in turkmen territory wa crushed at the battle of geok tepe , and shortly thereafter turkmenistan wa annexed , together with adjoining uzbek territory , into the russian empire . in 1916 , the russian empire 's participation in world war i resonated in turkmenistan , a an anticonscription revolt swept most of russian central asia . although the russian revolution of 1917 had little direct impact , in the 1920s turkmen force joined kazakh , kyrgyz people , and uzbek in the so-called basmachi rebellion against the rule of the newly formed soviet union . in 1924 , the turkmen soviet socialist republic wa formed from the tsarist province of transcaspia . by the late 1930s , soviet reorganization of agriculture had destroyed what remained of the nomadic lifestyle in turkmenistan , and moscow controlled political life . the 1948 ashgabat earthquake of 1948 killed over 110,000 people , amounting to two-thirds of the city 's population .
during the next half-century , turkmenistan played it designated economic role within the soviet union and remained outside the course of major world event . even the major history of the soviet union ( 19821991 ) that shook russia in the late 1980s had little impact . however , in 1990 , the supreme soviet of turkmenistan declared sovereignty a a nationalist response to perceived exploitation by moscow . although turkmenistan wa ill-prepared for independence and then-communist leader saparmurat niyazov preferred to preserve the soviet union , in october 1991 , the fragmentation of that entity forced him to call a national referendum that approved independence . on 26 december 1991 , the soviet union ceased to exist . niyazov continued a turkmenistan 's chief of state , replacing communism with a unique brand of independent nationalism reinforced by a pervasive cult of personality . a 1994 referendum and legislation in 1999 abolished further requirement for the president to stand for re-election ( although in 1992 he completely dominated the only turkmenistani presidential election , 1992 in which he ran , a he wa the only candidate and no one else wa allowed to run for the office ) , making him effectively president for life . during his tenure , niyazov conducted frequent purge of public official and abolished organization deemed threatening . throughout the post-soviet era , turkmenistan ha taken a neutral position on almost all international issue . niyazov eschewed membership in regional organization such a the shanghai cooperation organisation , and in the late 1990s he maintained relation with the taliban and it chief opponent in afghanistan , the northern alliance . he offered limited support to the war in afghanistan ( 2001present ) following the september 11 attack . in 2002 an alleged assassination attempt against niyazov led to a new wave of security restriction , dismissal of government official , and restriction placed on the medium . niyazov accused exiled former foreign minister boris shikhmuradov of having planned the attack .
between 2002 and 2004 , serious tension arose between turkmenistan and uzbekistan because of bilateral dispute and niyazov 's implication that uzbekistan had a role in the 2002 assassination attempt . in 2004 , a series of bilateral treaty restored friendly relation . in the turkmenistani parliamentary election , 2004 , only niyazov 's party wa represented , and no election monitoring participated . in 2005 , niyazov exercised his dictatorial power by closing all hospital outside ashgabat and all rural library . the year 2006 saw intensification of the trend of arbitrary policy change , shuffling of top official , diminishing economic output outside the oil and gas sector , and isolation from regional and world organization . china wa among a very few nation to whom turkmenistan made significant overture . the sudden death of niyazov at the end of 2006 left a complete vacuum of power , a list of cult of personality # turkmenistan , comparable to the kim il-sung 's cult of personality of eternal president kim il-sung of north korea , had precluded the naming of a successor . deputy prime minister gurbanguly berdimuhamedow , who wa named interim head of government , won the turkmen presidential election , 2007 held in early february 2007 . he wa turkmen presidential election , 2012 re-elected in 2012 with 97 % of the vote .

between 1998 and 2002 , turkmenistan suffered from the continued lack of adequate export route for natural gas and from obligation on extensive short-term external debt . at the same time , however , the value of total export ha risen sharply because of increase in international oil and gas price . economic prospect in the near future are discouraging because of widespread internal poverty and the burden of foreign debt .
ever since 2014 , international gas price have been falling quick , halving from 2014-2015 . though turkmenistan ha enough gas that it should not effect them , due to it lack of trade partner , turkmenistan 's economy ha not grown a much a expected due to the gas price , similar case of economic growth slowing due to this can be found in other place in central asia .

<section_title_start>  history  <section_title_end>
the nilotic people of south sudanthe acholi people , anyuak , bari people , dinka people , nuer people , shilluk people , kaligi people ( arabic feroghe ) , and othersfirst entered south sudan sometime before the 10th century , coinciding with the fall of medieval nubia . from the 15th to the 19th century , tribal migration , largely from the area of bahr el ghazal ( region of south sudan ) , brought the anyuak , dinka people , nuer people and shilluk people to their modern location in bahr el ghazal and the upper nile region , while the acholi and bari people settled in equatoria . the zande people , mundu , avukaya and baka people ( congo and south sudan ) , who entered south sudan in the 16th century , established the region 's largest state of equatoria region .
the dinka are the largest , nuer people the second largest , the zande people the third-largest , and the bari the fourth-largest of south sudan 's ethnic group . they are found in the maridi , yambio , and tombura district in the tropical rainforest belt of western equatoria , the adio of azande client in yei , central equatoria , and western bahr el ghazal . in the 18th century the avungara sib ( anthropology ) rose to power over the rest of azande society , a domination which continued into the 20th century . british policy favoring christian missionary , such a the closed district ordinance of 1922 ( see history of anglo-egyptian sudan ) , and geographical barrier such a the swampland along the white nile curtailed the spread of islam to the south , thus allowing the southern tribe to retain much of their social and cultural heritage , a well a their political and religious institution .
british colonial policy in sudan had a long history of emphasizing development of the arab north , and largely ignoring the black african south , which lacked school , hospital , road , bridge , and other basic infrastructure . after sudan 's first independent election in 1958 , the continued neglect of the southern region by the khartoum government led to uprising , revolt , and the longest civil war on the continent . people affected by the violence included the acholi , anyuak , baka people ( congo and south sudan ) , balanda bviri , bari , boya people , didinga , dinka , jiye people , kaligi people , kuku people , lotuka , mundari people , murie , nilotic , nuer people , shilluk people , toposa people and zande people .
slavery had been an institution of sudanese life throughout history . the slave trade in the south intensified in the 19th century , and continued after the british had suppressed slavery in much of sub-saharan africa . annual slavery in sudan into non-muslim territory resulted in the capture of countless thousand of southern sudanese , and the destruction of the region 's stability and economy .
the azande have had good relation with their neighbor , namely the moru people , mundu people , pojulu people , avukaya people , baka and the small group in bahr el ghazal , due to the expansionist policy of their king gbudwe , in the 18th century . in the 19th century , the azande fought the france , the belgium and the muhammad ahmed to maintain their independence . ottoman egypt , under the rule of khedive isma'il pasha , first attempted to control the region in the 1870s , establishing the province of equatoria in the southern portion . egypt 's first governor wa samuel baker , commissioned in 1869 , followed by charles george gordon in 1874 , and by emin pasha in 1878.
the muhammad ahmed of the 1880s destabilized the nascent province , and equatoria ceased to exist a an egyptian outpost in 1889 . important settlement in equatoria included lado district , gondokoro , dufile and wadelai . european colonial maneuverings in the region came to a head in 1898 , when the fashoda incident occurred at present-day kodok ; britain and france almost went to war over the region . in 1947 , british hope of joining south sudan with uganda while leaving western equatoria a part of the democratic republic of the congo were dashed by the rajaf conference to unify north and south sudan .
south sudan ha an estimated population of 8 million , but , given the lack of a census in several decade , this estimate may be severely distorted . the economy is predominantly rural and relies chiefly on subsistence farming . around 2005 , the economy began a transition from this rural dominance , and urban area within south sudan have seen extensive development .
the region ha been negatively affected by two civil war since sudanese independence : from 1955 to 1972 , the sudanese government fought the anyanya rebel army ( anya-nya is a term in the madi language ( sudan and uganda ) language which mean `` snake venom '' ) during the first sudanese civil war , followed by the sudan people 's liberation army/movement ( spla/m ) in the second sudanese civil war for over 20 year . a a result , the country suffered serious neglect , a lack of infrastructural development , and major destruction and displacement . more than 2.5 million people have been killed , and million more have become refugee both within and outside the country .

heinrich i of hohenlohe died in 1183 . his younger son heinrich von hohenlohe ( d. 1249 ) became grand master of the teutonic knight of the teutonic order . his grandson , gottfried and conrad , supporter of emperor frederick ii , holy roman emperor , founded the line of hohenlohe-hohenlohe and hohenlohe-brauneck in 1230 , the name taken from their respective castle . the emperor granted them the italian county of molise and romagna in 1229/30 , but they were not able to hold them for long . gottfried wa a tutor and close advisor to the emperor 's son king conrad iv of germany . when the latter survived an assassination attempt plotted by bishop albert i of pietengau of regensburg , he granted gottfried some possession of the prince-bishopric of regensburg , namely the vogt position for the order of saint augustine stift at hringen and the town of neuenstein , baden-wrttemberg and waldenburg , baden-wrttemberg . gottfried 's son kraft i acquired the town of ingelfingen with lichteneck castle . in 1253 the town and castle of langenburg were inherited by the lord of hohenlohe , after the lord of langenburg had become extinct . by 1300 , town and castle schillingsfrst had also passed into the possession of the hohenlohe lord .
hohlach later became part of the principality of ansbach , a subsequent state of the hohenzollern burgraviate of nuremberg , to which the hohenlohe family had sold the nearby town of uffenheim in 1378 , and hohlach some time later . yet the name hohenlohe remained attached to the county with it other territory .
the branch of hohenlohe-brauneck became extinct in 1390 , it land were sold to the hohenzollern margrave of ansbach in 1448 . hohenlohe-hohenlohe wa divided into several branch , two of which were hohenlohe-weikersheim and hohenlohe-uffenheim-markt einersheim ( 1330-1412 ) . hohenlohe-weikersheim , descended from count kraft i ( died 1313 ) , also underwent several division , the most important following the death of count albert and george in 1551 . at this time the two main branch of hohenlohe-neuenstein and hohenlohe-waldenburg were founded by george 's son . meanwhile , in 1412 , the branch of hohenlohe-uffenheim-speckfeld had become extinct , and it land passed to other family by marriage . george hohenlohe wa roman catholic diocese of passau prince-bishop of passau ( 13901423 ) and archbishop of esztergom ( 14181423 ) , serving king sigismund of hungary ( the later king of bohemia and holy roman emperor ) .
in 1450 , emperor frederick iii , holy roman emperor granted kraft of hohenlohe ( died 1472 ) and his brother , albrecht , the son of elizabeth of county of hanau , heiress to ziegenhain , the title count of hohenlohe and ziegenhain ( graf von hohenlohe und zu ziegenhain ) and invested them with the county of ziegenhain . actually , the landgrave of hesse soon took the county of ziegenhain , and the house of hohenlohe eventually gave up the reference to ziegenhain . however , their lordship of hohenlohe wa elevated to the status of an imperial county in 1495 . the county remained divided between several family branch , however still being an undivided imperial fief under the imperial jurisdiction , and wa to be represented by the family 's senior vis--vis the imperial court ( holy roman empire ) .
the hohenlohes were imperial count having two voice in the diet ( or assembly , called kreistag ) of the franconian circle . they also had six voice in the franconian college of imperial count ( frnkisches reichsgrafenkollegium ) of the imperial diet ( holy roman empire ) ( reichstag ) . the right to vote in the imperial diet gave a german noble family the status of imperial state ( reichsstnde ) and made them belong to the high nobility ( hoher adel ) , on a par with ruling prince and duke .
by 1455 , albrecht of hohenlohe had acquired the castle and lordship of bartenstein ( near schrozberg ) . in 1472 the town and castle of pfedelbach were bought by the hohenlohe family . in 1586 , weikersheim wa inherited by count wolfgang , count of hohenlohe-weikersheim who reconstructed the medieval weikersheim castle into a renaissance palace . when the last weikersheim count , carl ludwig , died around 1760 , his land were divided between the langenburg , neuenstein and hringen branch ; in 1967 , prince constantin of hohenlohe-langenburg sold weikersheim castle , meanwhile a museum , to the state .
the existing branch of the hohenlohe family are descended from the line of hohenlohe-neuenstein and hohenlohe-waldenburg , established in 1551 by ludwig kasimir ( d. 1568 ) and eberhard ( d. 1570 ) , the son of count georg i ( d. 1551 ) . since georg had become protestantism on his deathbed , the reformation wa introduced in the county and confirmed by the peace of augsburg in 1556 . in 1667 however , a confessional division arose when the two son of georg friedrich ii of hohenlohe-waldenburg-schillingsfrst , christian ( founder of the bartenstein line ) and ludwig gustav ( founder of the schillingsfrst line ) , converted to the roman catholic church . after the extinction of two other side line , waldenburg in 1679 and waldenburg-pfedelbach in 1728 , the whole property of the main branch hohenlohe-waldenburg wa inherited by the catholic count .
of the lutheran branch of hohenlohe-neuenstein , which underwent several partition and inherited the county of gleichen in thuringia ( with it residence in ohrdruf , thuringia ) in 1631 , the senior line became extinct in 1805 , while in 1701 the junior line divided itself into three branch , those of hohenlohe-langenburg , hohenlohe-ingelfingen and hohenlohe-kirchberg . the branch of kirchberg died out in 1861 , with it land and castle passing to the hringen-neuenstein branch ( sold in 1952 ) , but the branch of hohenlohe-langenburg ( residing at langenburg castle ) and hohenlohe-ingelfingen still exist , the latter being divided into hohenlohe-ingelfingen-hringen ( which became extinct in 1960 ) and hohenlohe-oehringen ( today residing at neuenstein castle ) . the two actual head of the branch of langenburg and oehringen are traditionally styled frst .
frederick louis , prince of hohenlohe-ingelfingen , had acquired the estate of kdzierzyn-kole , ujazd and gmina rudziniec in silesia by marriage in 1782 , an area of 108 square mile , where his grandson hugo zu hohenlohe-hringen , duke of ujest , established calamine ( mineral ) mine and founded one of the largest zinc smelting plant in the world . his son , prince christian kraft ( 1848-1926 ) , sold the plant and went almost bankrupt with a fund in which he had invested in 1913 ; the mine he had still kept were , however , divided between germany and poland , together with upper silesia , in 1922 , and in 1945 were depropriated by communist poland .
the roman catholic branch of hohenlohe-waldenburg wa soon divided into three side branch , but two of these had died out by 1729 . the surviving branch , that of schillingsfrst , wa divided into the line of hohenlohe-schillingsfrst and hohenlohe-bartenstein , with further division following . the four catholic line which still exist today ( with their head styled frst ) are those of hohenlohe-schillingsfrst ( at schillingsfrst ) , hohenlohe-waldenburg-schillingsfrst ( at waldenburg ) , hohenlohe-jagstberg ( at haltenbergstetten ) and hohenlohe-bartenstein ( at bartenstein ) . a side branch of the house of hohenlohe-schillingsfrst inherited the duchy of racibrz in silesia in 1834 , together with the principality of corvey in westphalia . while the silesian property wa expropriated in poland in 1945 , princely abbey of corvey remains owned by the duke of ratibor to this day , together with further inherited property in austria .
the holy roman emperor granted the title of imperial prince ( reichsfrst ) to the waldenburg line ( in 1744 ) and to the neuenstein ( hringen ) line ( in 1764 ) .
in 1757 , the holy roman emperor elevated possession of the waldenburg line to the status of imperial principality .
in 1772 , the holy roman emperor elevated possession of the neuenstein and langenburg line to the status of imperial principality .
on 12 july 1806 , the principality became part of the kingdom of kingdom of bavaria and of kingdom of wrttemberg by the act of the confederation of the rhine . therefore , the region of hohenlohe is presently located for the most part in the north eastern part of the state of baden-wrttemberg ( forming the county of hohenlohe ( district ) , schwbisch hall ( district ) and the southern part of main-tauber-kreis ) , with smaller part in the bavarian administrative district of middle franconia and lower franconia . the hohenlohisch dialect is part of the east franconian german dialect group and the population still value it traditional distinct identity .

the maldivian archipelago is located on the chagos-laccadive ridge , a vast submarine mountain range in the indian ocean ; this also form a ecoregion # terrestrial , together with the chagos archipelago and lakshadweep . with an average ground-level elevation of above sea level , it is the world 's lowest-lying country , with even it list of elevation extreme by country being one of the lowest in the world , at .
in the 12th century islam reached the maldivian archipelago , which wa consolidated a a list of sultan of the maldives , developing strong commercial and cultural tie with asia and africa . from the mid-16th-century the region came under the increasing influence of european colonialism , with maldives becoming a british protectorate in 1887 . history of the maldives # independence from the united kingdom came in 1965 , and a presidential system wa established in 1968 with an elected people 's majlis . the ensuing decade have seen political instability , effort at democratic reform , and environmental challenge posed by global warming .

<section_title_start> toponymy <section_title_end>
according to legend , the first settler of maldives were people known a dheyvis . the first kingdom of the maldives wa known a dheeva maari . in the 3rd century bc during the visit of emissary sent by emperor asoka , maldives wa known a dheeva mahal .
during c. 1100 - 1166 , maldives wa also referred a diva kudha and the laccadive archipelago which wa a part of maldives wa then referred to a diva khanbar by the scholar and polymath al-biruni ( 973-1048 ) .
the name maldives may also derive from sanskrit ml ( garland ) and dvpa ( island ) , or   maala divaina ( `` necklace island '' ) in sinhala language . the maldivian people are called dhivehin . the word dheeb/deeb ( archaic dhivehi , related to sanskrit  , dvpa ) mean `` island '' , and dhives ( dhivehin ) mean `` islander '' ( i.e. , maldivian ) .
the ancient sri lankan chronicle mahawamsa refers to an island called mahiladiva ( `` island of woman '' ,  ) in pali , which is probably a mistranslation of the same sanskrit word meaning `` garland '' .
jan hogendorn , grossman professor of economics , theorises that the name maldives derives from the sanskrit mldvpa (  ) , meaning `` garland of island '' . in tamil , `` garland of island '' can be translated a malai theevu (  ) . in malayalam , `` garland of island '' can be translated a maladweepu (  ) . in kannada , `` garland of island '' can be translated a maaledweepa (  ) . none of these name is mentioned in any literature , but classical sanskrit text dating back to the vedic period mention the `` hundred thousand island '' ( lakshadweepa ) , a generic name which would include not only the maldives , but also the laccadives , aminidivi island , minicoy , and the chagos archipelago group .
some medieval traveller such a ibn battuta called the island mahal dibiyat (   ) from the arabic language word mahal ( `` palace '' ) , which must be how the berber people traveller interpreted the local name , having been through muslim north india , where perso-arabic word were introduced to the local vocabulary . this is the name currently inscribed on the scroll in the emblem of maldives . the classical persian/arabic name for maldives is dibajat . the dutch referred to the island a the maldivische eilanden ( ) , while the british anglicisation the local name for the island first to the `` maldive island '' and later to `` maldives '' .
garcia da orta , in a conversational book first published in 1563 , writes a follows : `` i must tell you that i have heard it said that the native do not call it maldiva but nalediva . in the malabar language nale mean four and diva island . so that in that language the word signifies `` four island , '' while we , corrupting the name , call it maldiva . ''
<section_title_start> history <section_title_end>
<section_title_start> ancient history and settlement <section_title_end>
the maldives is an old nation , well over 2,500 year old according to legend of the southern atoll .
according to the book `` kitb fi thr mdhu al-qdimah (      ) ( `` on the ancient ruin of meedhoo ( addu ) '' ) '' written in the 17th century in arabic by allama ahmed shihabuddine ( allama shihab al-din ) of meedhoo ( addu ) in addu atoll , the first settler of the maldives were people known a dheyvis . they came from the kalibangan in india . the time of their arrival is unknown but it wa before emperor ashoka 's kingdom in 269-232 bc . shihabuddine 's story tally remarkably well with the recorded history of south asia and that of copperplate document of maldives known a lmfnu .
the maapanansa , the copper plate on which wa recorded the history of the first list of sultan of the maldives from the solar dynasty , were lost quite early on .
a 4th-century notice written by ammianus marcellinus ( 362 ad ) speaks of gift sent to the roman emperor julian ( emperor ) by a deputation from the nation of divi . the name divi is very similar to dheyvi who were the first settler of maldives .
the ancient history of maldives is told in copperplate , ancient script carved on coral artifact , tradition , language and different ethnicity of maldivian .
the first maldivian did not leave any archaeological artifact . their building were probably built of wood , palm frond , and other perishable material , which would have quickly decayed in the salt and wind of the tropical climate . moreover , chief or headman did not reside in elaborate stone palace , nor did their religion require the construction of large temple or compound .
comparative study of maldivian oral , linguistic , and cultural tradition confirm that the first settler were people from the southern shore of the neighboring indian subcontinent , including the giraavaru people , mentioned in ancient legend and local folklore about the establishment of the capital and kingly rule in mal .
a strong underlying layer of dravidian people population and culture survives in maldivian society , with a clear tamilkannada language tamil-malayalam substratum in the language , which also appears in place name , kinship term , poetry , dance , and religious belief . malabar region and pandyan seafaring culture led to the settlement of the island by tamil and malabars seafarer .
the maldive island were mentioned in ancient sangam tamil literature a `` munneer pazhantheevam '' or `` older island of three sea '' .
<section_title_start> buddhist period <section_title_end>
despite being just mentioned briefly in most history book , the 1,400-year-long buddhist period ha foundational importance in the history of the maldives . it wa during this period that the culture of the maldives both developed and flourished , a culture which survives today . the maldivian dhivehi language , early maldive dhivehi writing system , architecture , ruling institution , custom , and manner of the maldivian originated at the time when the maldives were a buddhist kingdom .
buddhism probably spread to the maldives in the 3rd century bc at the time of emperor ashoka 's expansion and became the dominant religion of the people of the maldives until the 12th century ad . the ancient maldivian king promoted buddhism , and the first maldive writing and artistic achievement , in the form of highly developed sculpture and architecture , originate from that period . nearly all archaeological remains in the maldives are from buddhist stupa and monastery , and all artifact found to date display characteristic buddhist iconography .
buddhist ( and hindu ) temple were mandala shaped . they are oriented according to the four cardinal point with the main gate facing east . local historian hassan ahmed maniku counted a many a 59 island with buddhist archaeological site in a provisional list he published in 1990.
<section_title_start> islamic period <section_title_end>
the importance of the arab a trader in the indian ocean by the 12th century may partly explain why the last buddhist king of maldives , dhovemi of the maldives , converted to islam in the year 1153 ( or 1193 ) . adopting the muslim title of sultan muhammad ibn abdullah , he initiated a series of six islamic dynasty that lasted until 1932 when the sultanate became elective . the formal title of the sultan up to 1965 wa , sultan of land and sea , lord of the twelve-thousand island and sultan of the maldives which came with the style highness .
somali muslim abu al-barakat yusuf al-barbari , also known a aw barkhadle , is traditionally credited for this conversion . according to the story told to ibn battutah , a mosque wa built with the inscription : 'the sultan ahmad shanurazah accepted islam at the hand of abu al-barakat yusuf al-barbari . ' some scholar have suggested the possibility of ibn battuta misreading maldive text , and having a bias towards the north african , maghrebi narrative of this shaykh , instead of the east african origin account that wa known a well at the time . even when ibn battuta visited the island , the governor of the island at that time wa abd al-aziz of mogadishu , a somali
scholar have posited another scenario where abu al-barakat yusuf al-barbari might have been a native of berbera , a significant trading port on the northwestern coast of somalia . barbara or barbaroi ( berber ) , a the ancestor of the somali people were referred to by medieval arab people and ancient greek geographer , respectively . this is also seen when ibn battuta visited mogadishu , he mention that the sultan at that time , `` abu bakr ibn shaikh omar '' , wa a berber ( somali ) . according to scholar , abu al-barakat yusuf al-barbari wa yusuf bin ahmad al-kawneyn , a famous native somali scholar known for establishing the walashma dynasty of the horn of africa . after his conversion of the population of dogor ( now known a aw barkhadle ) , a town in somalia , he is also credited to have been responsible for spreading islam in the maldivian island , establishing the mal friday mosque , and converting the maldivian population to islam . ibn battuta state the maldivian king wa converted by abu al-barakat yusuf al-barbari ( blessed father of somalia ) .
others have it he may have been from the persian town of tabriz . the first reference to an iranian origin date to an 18th-century persian text .
his venerated tomb now stand on the ground of medhu ziyaaraiy , across the street from the friday mosque , or mal friday mosque , in mal . built in 1656 , this is the oldest mosque in maldives . following the islamic concept that before islam there wa the time of jahiliya ( ignorance ) , in the history book used by maldivian the # introduction of islam at the end of the 12th century is considered the cornerstone of the country 's history . nonetheless , the cultural influence of buddhism remains , a reality directly experienced by ibn battuta during his nine month there sometime between 1341 and 1345 , serving a a chief judge and marrying into the royal family of omar i of the maldives . for he became embroiled in local politics and left when his strict judgment in the laissez-faire island kingdom began to chafe with it ruler . in particular , he wa dismayed at the local woman going about with no clothing above the waista violation of middle eastern islamic standard of modestyand the local taking no notice when he complained .
compared to the other area of south asia , the conversion of the maldives to islam happened relatively late . arab trader had converted population in the malabar coast since the 7th century , and muhammad bin qasim had converted large swathe of sindh to islam at about the same time . the maldives remained a buddhist kingdom for another 500 year after the conversion of malabar coast and sindhperhaps a the southwesternmost buddhist country . arabic became the prime language of administration ( instead of persian and urdu ) , and the maliki school of jurisprudence wa introduced , both hinting at direct contact with the core of the arab world .
middle eastern seafarer had just begun to take over the indian ocean trade route in the 10th century and found maldives to be an important link in those route a the first landfall for trader from basra sailing to southeast asia . trade involved mainly cowrie shellswidely used a a form of currency throughout asia and part of the east african coastand coir fiber . the bengal sultanate , where cowrie shell were used a legal tender , wa one of the principal trading partner of the maldives . the bengalmaldives cowry shell trade wa the largest shell currency trade network in history .
the other essential product of the maldives wa coir , the fibre of the dried coconut [ resistant to saltwater . it stitched together and rigged the dhow ] s that plied the indian ocean . maldivian coir wa exported to sindh , [ [ china , yemen , and the persian gulf .
<section_title_start> colonial period <section_title_end>
in 1558 the portuguese established a small garrison with a viador ( viyazoru ) , or overseer of a factory ( trading post ) in the maldives , which they administered from their main colony in goa . their attempt to impose christianity provoked a local revolt led by muhammad thakurufaanu al auzam muhammad thakurufaanu al-a'uam and his two brother , that fifteen year later drove the portuguese out of maldives . this event is now commemorated a national day .
in the mid-17th century , the dutch , who had replaced the portuguese a the dominant power in ceylon , established hegemony over maldivian affair without involving themselves directly in local matter , which were governed according to centuries-old islamic custom .
the british expelled the dutch from ceylon in 1796 and included maldives a a british protectorate . the status of maldives a a british protectorate wa officially recorded in an 1887 agreement in which the sultan accepted british influence over maldivian external relation and defence while retaining home rule , which continued to be regulated by muslim traditional institution in exchange for an maldivian annual tribute . the status of the island wa akin to other british protectorate in the indian ocean region , including zanzibar and the trucial state .
in the british period , the sultan 's power were taken over by the chief minister , much to the chagrin of the british governor-general who continued to deal with the ineffectual sultan . consequently , britain encouraged the development of a constitutional monarchy , and the first constitution wa proclaimed in 1932 . however , the new arrangement favoured neither the aging sultan nor the wily chief minister , but rather a young crop of british-educated reformist . a a result , angry mob were instigated against the constitution which wa publicly torn up .
maldives remained a british crown protectorate until 1953 when the sultanate wa suspended and the first republic wa declared under the short-lived presidency of muhammad amin didi . while serving a prime minister during the 1940s , didi nationalized the fish export industry . a president , he is remembered a a reformer of the education system and a promoter of woman 's right . conservative in mal eventually ousted his government , and during a riot over food shortage , didi wa beaten by a mob and died on a nearby island .
beginning in the 1950s , the political history in maldives wa largely influenced by the british military presence in the island . in 1954 the restoration of the sultanate perpetuated the rule of the past . two year later , the united kingdom obtained permission to reestablish it wartime raf gan airfield in the southernmost addu atoll , employing hundred of local . in 1957 , however , the new prime minister , ibrahim nasir , called for a review of the agreement . nasir wa challenged in 1959 by a local secessionist movement in the three southernmost atoll that benefited economically from the british presence on gan ( seenu atoll ) . this group cut tie with the maldives government and formed an independent state , the united suvadive republic with abdullah afif a president and hithadhoo ( seenu atoll ) a capital . one year later the suvadive republic wa scrapped after nasir sent gunboat from mal with government police , and abdulla afif went into exile . meanwhile , in 1960 the maldives had allowed the united kingdom to continue to use both the raf gan and the hitaddu facility for a thirty-year period , with the payment of 750,000 over the period of 1960 to 1965 for the purpose of maldives ' economic development . the base wa closed in 1976 a part of the larger british withdrawal of permanently-stationed force 'east of suez ' .
<section_title_start> independence and republic <section_title_end>
when the british became increasingly unable to continue their colonial hold on asia and were losing their colony to the indigenous population who wanted freedom , on 26 july 1965 an agreement wa signed on behalf of the sultan by ibrahim nasir rannabandeyri kilegefan , prime minister , and on behalf of the british government by sir michael walker , british ambassador-designate to the maldive island , which formally ended the british authority on the defence and external affair of the maldives . the island thus achieved freedom , with the ceremony taking place at the british high commissioner 's residence in colombo . after this , the sultanate continued for another three year under muhammad fareed didi , who declared himself king upon independence .
on 15 november 1967 , a vote wa taken in parliament to decide whether the maldives should continue a a constitutional monarchy or become a republic . of the 44 member of parliament , 40 voted in favour of a republic . on 15 march 1968 , a national referendum wa held on the question , and 93.34 % of those taking part voted in favour of establishing a republic . the republic wa declared on 11 november 1968 , thus ending the 853-year-old monarchy , which wa replaced by a republic under the presidency of ibrahim nasir . a the king had held little real power , this wa seen a a cosmetic change and required few alteration in the structure of government .
tourism in the maldives began to be developed on the archipelago by the beginning of the 1970s . the first resort in the maldives wa kurumba maldives which welcomed the first guest on 3 october 1972 . the first accurate census wa held in december 1977 and showed 142,832 people living in the maldives .
political infighting during the 1970s between nasir 's faction and other political figure led to the 1975 arrest and exile of elected prime minister ahmed zaki ( politician ) to a remote atoll . economic decline followed the closure of the gan international airport and the collapse of the market for dried fish , an important export . with support for his administration faltering , nasir fled to singapore in 1978 , with million of dollar from the treasury .
maumoon abdul gayoom began his 30-year role a president in 1978 , winning six consecutive election without opposition . his election wa seen a ushering in a period of political stability and economic development in view of maumoon 's priority to develop the poorer island . tourism flourished and increased foreign contact spurred development . however , maumoon 's rule wa controversial , with some critic saying maumoon wa an autocrat who quelled dissent by limiting freedom and political favouritism .
a series of coup attempt ( in 1980 , 1983 , and 1988 ) by nasir supporter and business interest tried to topple the government without success . while the first two attempt met with little success , the 1988 coup attempt involved a roughly 80 strong mercenary force of the people 's liberation organisation of tamil eelam who seized the airport and caused maumoon to flee from house to house until the intervention of 1,600 indian armed force airlifted into mal restored order .
the november 1988 coup wa headed by muhammadu ibrahim lutfee , a businessman . on the night of 3 november 1988 , the indian air force airlifted a parachute regiment ( india ) # operation cactus from agra and flew them over to the maldives . the indian paratrooper landed at hulhul island and secured the airfield and restored the government rule at mal within hour . the brief operation , labelled operation cactus , also involved the indian navy .

during the later part of maumoon 's rule , independent political movement emerged in maldives , which challenged the then-ruling dhivehi rayyithunge party ( maldivian people 's party , mpp ) and demanded democratic reform . the dissident journalist and activist mohamed nasheed founded the maldivian democratic party ( mdp ) in 2003 and pressured maumoon into allowing gradual political reform . in 2008 a new constitution wa approved and the maldivian presidential election , 2008 occurred , which were won by nasheed in the second round . his administration faced many challenge , including the huge debt left by the previous government , the economic downturn following the 2004 tsunami , overspending by mean of overprinting of local currency ( the rufiyaa ) , unemployment , corruption , and increasing drug use . taxation on good wa imposed for the first time in the country , and import duty were reduced in many good and service . social welfare benefit were given to those aged 65 year or older , single parent , and those with special need .

<section_title_start> geography <section_title_end>
the maldives consists of 1,192 coral island grouped in a double chain of 26 atoll , that stretch along a length of north to south , east to west , spread over roughly , of which only is dry land , making this one of the world 's most dispersed country . it lie between latitude 1st parallel south 1 and 8th parallel north 8n , and longitude 72nd meridian east 72 and 74th meridian east 74e . the atoll are composed of live coral reef and sand bar , situated atop a submarine ridge long that rise abruptly from the depth of the indian ocean and run north to south .
only near the southern end of this natural coral barricade do two open passage permit safe ship navigation from one side of the indian ocean to the other through the territorial water of maldives . for administrative purpose , the maldivian government organised these atoll into 21 administrative division of the maldives . the largest island of maldives is that of gan ( laamu atoll ) , which belongs to laamu atoll or hahdhummathi maldives . in addu atoll , the westernmost island are connected by road over the reef ( collectively called link road ) and the total length of the road is .
maldives is the lowest country in the world , with maximum and average natural ground level of only and above sea level , respectively . in area where construction exists , however , this ha been increased to several metre . more than 80 per cent of the country 's land is composed of coral island which rise le than one metre above sea level . a a result , the maldives are at high risk of being submerged due to sea level rise . the ipcc un 's environmental panel ha warned that , at current rate , sea-level rise would be high enough to make the maldives uninhabitable by 2100.
<section_title_start> climate <section_title_end>
the maldives ha a tropical monsoon climate ( am ) under the kppen climate classification , which is affected by the large landmass of south asia to the north . because the maldives ha the lowest elevation of any country in the world , the temperature is constantly hot and often humid . the presence of this landmass cause differential heating of land and water . these factor set off a rush of moisture-rich air from the indian ocean over south asia , resulting in the southwest monsoon . two season dominate maldives ' weather : the dry season associated with the winter northeastern monsoon and the rainy season associated with the southwest monsoon which brings strong wind and storm .
the shift from the dry northeast monsoon to the moist southwest monsoon occurs during april and may . during this period , the southwest wind contribute to the formation of the southwest monsoon , which reach maldives at the beginning of june and last until the end of november . however , the weather pattern of maldives do not always conform to the monsoon pattern of south asia . the annual rainfall average in the north and in the south .
the monsoonal influence is greater in the north of the maldives than in the south , more influenced by the equatorial counter current .
the average high temperature is 31.5 degree celsius and the average low temperature is 26.4 degree celsius .
<section_title_start> sea level rise <section_title_end>
the intergovernmental panel on climate change 's 2007 report predicted the upper limit of the sea level rise will be by 2100 , which mean that most of the republic 's 200 inhabited island may need to be abandoned . according to researcher from the university of southampton , the maldives are the third most endangered island nation due to flooding from climate change a a percentage of population .
former president mohamed nasheed ha been highly outspoken about this issue , saying in 2012 that `` if carbon emission continue at the rate they are climbing today , my country will be under water in seven year . '' he ha called for more climate change mitigation action while on the american television show the daily show and the late show with david letterman , and hosted `` the world 's first underwater cabinet meeting '' in 2009 to raise awareness of the threat posed by climate change . concern over sea level rise have also been expressed by nasheed 's predecessor , maumoon abdul gayoom .
in 2008 , nasheed announced plan to look into purchasing new land in india , sri lanka , and australia because of his concern about global warming , and the possibility of much of the island being inundated with water from rising sea level . the purchase of land will be made from a fund generated by tourism . the president explained his intention : `` we do not want to leave the maldives , but we also do not want to be climate refugee living in tent for decade '' .
by 2020 , maldives plan to eliminate or offset all of it greenhouse gas emission . at the 2009 international climate talk , nasheed explained that : for u swearing off fossil fuel is not only the right thing to do , it is in our economic self-interest ... pioneering country will free themselves from the unpredictable price of foreign oil ; they will capitalise on the new green economy of the future , and they will enhance their moral standing giving them greater political influence on the world stage .
in 2020 , a three-year study at the university of plymouth found that a tide move sediment to create higher elevation , the island , and also tuvalu and kiribati , may rise instead of sink .

these coral reef are home to a variety of marine ecosystem that vary from planktonic organism to whale shark . sponge have gained importance a five specie have displayed anti-tumor and anti-cancer property .
in 1998 , sea-temperature warming of a much a due to a single el nio-southern oscillation event caused coral bleaching , killing two-thirds of the nation 's coral reef .
in an effort to induce the regrowth of the reef , scientist placed electrified cone anywhere from below the surface to provide a substrate for larval coral attachment . in 2004 , scientist witnessed coral regenerating . coral began to eject pink-orange egg and sperm . the growth of these electrified coral wa five time faster than untreated coral . scientist azeez hakim stated :
again , in 2016 , the coral reef of the maldives experienced a coral bleaching # maldives . up to 95 % of coral around some island have died , and , even after six month , 100 % of young coral transplant died . the surface water temperature reached an all-time high in 2016 , at 31 degree celsius in may .
recent scientific study suggest that the faunistic composition can vary greatly between neighbour atoll , especially in term of benthic fauna . difference in term of fishing pressure ( including poaching ) could be the cause .

<section_title_start> etymology <section_title_end>
during the colonial period and at independence , the country wa geographical renaming dahomey . on 30 november 1975 , it wa renamed benin . `` dahomey changed it name to the republic of benin ( rpublique du benin ) in memory of pre-19th century greatness of ancient benin of nigeria '' , referring to the historic kingdom of benin .
<section_title_start> history <section_title_end>
<section_title_start> precolonial period <section_title_end>
the current country of benin combine three area which had distinctly different political system and ethnicity prior to french colonial control . before 1700 , there were a few important city-state along the coast ( primarily of the aja people ethnic group , but also including yoruba people and gbe language people ) and a mass of tribal region inland ( composed of bariba people , mahi , gedevi , and kabye people ) . the oyo empire , located primarily to the east of modern benin , wa the most significant large-scale military force in the region . it regularly conducted raid and exacted tribute from the coastal kingdom and the tribal region . the situation changed in the 1600s and early 1700s a the kingdom of dahomey , consisting mostly of fon people , wa founded on the abomey plateau and began taking over area along the coast . by 1727 , king agaja of the kingdom of dahomey had conquered the coastal city of allada and ouidah , but it had become a tributary of the oyo empire and did not directly attack the oyo allied city-state of porto-novo . the rise of the kingdom of dahomey , the rivalry between the kingdom and the city of porto-novo , and the continued tribal politics of the northern region , persisted into the colonial and post-colonial period .
the dahomey wa known for it culture and tradition . young boy were often apprenticed to older soldier , and taught the kingdom 's military custom until they were old enough to join the army . dahomey wa also famous for instituting an elite female soldier corp , called ahosi , i.e . the king 's wife , or mino , `` our mother '' in the fon language fongbe , and known by many european a the dahomean amazon . this emphasis on military preparation and achievement earned dahomey the nickname of `` black sparta '' from european observer and 19th-century explorer such a sir richard burton .
<section_title_start> early portuguese colonization and the slave trade <section_title_end>
the king of dahomey sold their war captive into atlantic slave trade . they also had a practice of killing war captive in a ceremony known a the annual custom of dahomey . by about 1750 , the king of dahomey wa earning an estimated 250,000 per year by selling african captive to european slave-traders .
though the leader of dahomey appear to have initially resisted the slave trade , it flourished in the region of dahomey for almost three hundred year , beginning in 1472 with a trade agreement with portuguese empire merchant . the area wa named the slave coast of west africa `` slave coast '' because of this flourishing trade . court protocol , which demanded that a portion of war captive from the kingdom 's many battle be decapitated , decreased the number of enslaved people exported from the area . the number went from 102,000 people per decade in the 1780s to 24,000 per decade by the 1860s . the decline wa partly due to the slave trade act 1807 banning the trans-atlantic slave trade by britain in 1808 , followed by other country . this decline continued until 1885 , when the last slave ship departed from the coast of the modern benin republic bound for brazil in south america , which had yet to abolish slavery . the capital 's name porto-novo is of portuguese origin , meaning `` new port '' . it wa originally developed a a port for the slave trade .
among the good the portuguese sought were carved item of ivory made by benin  s artisan in the form of carved saltcellar , spoon , and hunting horn - the first piece of african art produced for sale abroad a exotic object .

ecuador ( ; ; quechuan language : ikwayur ; shuar language : ecuador or ekuatur ) , officially the republic of ecuador ( repblica del ecuador , which literally translates a `` republic of the equator '' ; quechuan language : ikwadur ripuwlika ; shuar language : ekuatur nunka ) , is a country in northwestern south america , bordered by colombia on the north , peru on the east and south , and the pacific ocean on the west . ecuador also includes the galpagos island in the pacific , about west of the mainland . the capital is quito .
the territory of modern-day ecuador were once home to a variety of indigenous people in ecuador group that were gradually incorporated into the inca empire during the 15th century . the territory wa spanish colonization of the america during the 16th century , achieving independence in 1820 a part of gran colombia , from which it emerged a it own sovereign state in 1830 . the legacy of both empire is reflected in ecuador 's ethnically diverse population , with most of it million people being mestizo , followed by large minority of european , indigenous people in ecuador , and afro-ecuadorians descendant . spanish language is the official language and is spoken by a majority of the population , though 13 native language are also recognized , including quechuan language and shuar language .
the sovereign state of ecuador is a middle-income representative democracy republic and a developing country that is highly dependent on commodity , namely petroleum and agricultural product . it is governed a a democratic presidential system republic . one of 17 megadiverse country in the world , ecuador host many endemism plant and animal , such a those of the galpagos island . in recognition of it unique ecological heritage , the new constitution of 2008 is the first in the world to recognize legally enforceable right of nature , or ecosystem right . it also ha the list of country by intentional homicide rate . between 2006 and 2016 , poverty decreased from 36.7 % to 22.5 % and annual per caput gdp growth wa 1.5 percent ( a compared to 0.6 percent over the prior two decade ) . at the same time , the country 's gini index of economic inequality decreased from 0.55 to 0.47.
<section_title_start> history <section_title_end>
<section_title_start> pre-inca era <section_title_end>
various people had settled in the area of future ecuador before the arrival of the inca . the archeological evidence suggests that the paleo-indian ' first dispersal into the america occurred near the end of the last glacial period , around 16,50013,000 year ago . the first indian who reached ecuador may have journeyed by land from north and central america or by boat down the pacific ocean coastline . much later migration to ecuador may have come via the amazon tributary , others descended from northern south america , and others ascended from the southern part of south america through the andes . they developed different language while emerging a unique ethnic group .
even though their language were unrelated , these group developed similar group of culture , each based in different environment . the people of the coast developed a fishing , hunting , and gathering culture ; the people of the highland andes developed a sedentary agricultural way of life , and the people of the amazon basin developed a nomadic hunting-and-gathering mode of existence .
over time these group began to interact and intermingle with each other so that group of family in one area became one community or tribe , with a similar language and culture . many civilization arose in ecuador , such a the valdivia culture and machalilla culture on the coast , the quitus ( near present-day quito ) , and the caari ( near present-day cuenca , ecuador ) . each civilisation developed it own distinctive architecture , pottery , and religious interest .
in the highland andes mountain , where life wa more sedentary , group of tribe cooperated and formed village ; thus the first nation based on agricultural resource and the domestication of animal formed . eventually , through war and marriage alliance of their leader , a group of nation formed confederation . one region consolidated under a confederation called the shyris , which exercised organized trading and bartering between the different region . it political and military power came under the rule of the duchicela blood-line .
<section_title_start> inca era <section_title_end>
when the inca arrived , they found that these confederation were so developed that it took the inca two generation of rulerstopa inca yupanqui and huayna capacto absorb them into the inca empire . the native confederation that gave them the most problem were deported to distant area of peru , bolivia , and north argentina . similarly , a number of loyal inca subject from peru and bolivia were brought to ecuador to prevent rebellion . thus , the region of highland ecuador became part of the inca empire in 1463 sharing the same language .
in contrast , when the inca made incursion into coastal ecuador and the eastern amazon jungle of ecuador , they found both the environment and indigenous people more hostile . moreover , when the inca tried to subdue them , these indigenous people withdrew to the interior and resorted to guerrilla tactic . a a result , inca expansion into the amazon basin and the pacific coast of ecuador wa hampered . the indigenous people of the amazon jungle and coastal ecuador remained relatively autonomous until the spanish soldier and missionary arrived in force . the amazonian people and the chachi people of coastal ecuador were the only group to resist inca and spanish domination , maintaining their language and culture well into the 21st century .
before the arrival of the spaniard , the inca empire wa involved in a inca civil war . the untimely death of both the heir ninan cuchi and the emperor huayna capac , from a european disease that spread into ecuador , created a power vacuum between two faction . the northern faction headed by atahualpa claimed that huayna capac gave a verbal decree before his death about how the empire should be divided . he gave the territory pertaining to present-day ecuador and northern peru to his favorite son atahualpa , who wa to rule from quito ; and he gave the rest to huscar , who wa to rule from cuzco . he willed that his heart be buried in quito , his favorite city , and the rest of his body be buried with his ancestor in cuzco .
huscar did not recognize his father 's will , since it did not follow inca tradition of naming an inca through the priest . huscar ordered atahualpa to attend their father 's burial in cuzco and pay homage to him a the new inca ruler . atahualpa , with a large number of his father 's veteran soldier , decided to ignore huscar , and a civil war ensued . a number of bloody battle took place until finally huscar wa captured . atahualpa marched south to cuzco and massacred the royal family associated with his brother .
in 1532 , a small band of spaniard headed by francisco pizarro landed in tumbez and marched over the andes mountain until they reached cajamarca , where the new inca atahualpa wa to hold an interview with them . valverde , the priest , tried to convince atahualpa that he should join the catholic church and declare himself a vassal of spain . this infuriated atahualpa so much that he threw the bible to the ground . at this point the enraged spaniard , with order from valverde , attacked and massacred unarmed escort of the inca and captured atahualpa . pizarro promised to release atahualpa if he made good his promise of filling a room full of gold . but , after a mock trial , the spaniard executed atahualpa by strangulation .

after nearly 300 year of spanish rule , quito wa still a small city numbering 10,000 inhabitant . on august 10 , 1809 , the city 's criollo people called for independence from spain ( first among the people of latin america ) . they were led by juan po montfar , quiroga , salina , and bishop cuero y caicedo . quito 's nickname , `` luz de amrica '' ( `` light of america '' ) , is based on it leading role in trying to secure an independent , local government . although the new government lasted no more than two month , it had important repercussion and wa an inspiration for the independence movement of the rest of spanish america . august 10 is now celebrated a independence day , a public holiday in ecuador .
<section_title_start> independence <section_title_end>
on october 9 , 1820 , the department of guayaquil became the first territory in ecuador to gain it independence from spain , and it spawned most of the ecuadorian coastal province , establishing itself a an independent state . it inhabitant celebrated what is now ecuador 's official independence day on may 24 , 1822 . the rest of ecuador gained it independence after antonio jos de sucre defeated the spanish royalist force at the battle of pichincha , near quito . following the battle , ecuador joined simn bolvar 's republic of gran colombia , also including modern-day colombia , venezuela and panama . in 1830 , ecuador separated from gran colombia and became an independent republic .
the 19th century wa marked by instability for ecuador with a rapid succession of ruler . the first president of ecuador wa the venezuelan-born juan jos flores , who wa ultimately deposed , followed by several authoritarian leader , such a vicente rocafuerte ; jos joaqun de olmedo ; jos mara urbina ; diego noboa ; pedro jos de arteta ; manuel de ascsubi ; and flores 's own son , antonio flores jijn , among others . the conservative gabriel garcia moreno unified the country in the 1860s with the support of the roman catholic church . in the late 19th century , world demand for cocoa bean tied the economy to commodity export and led to migration from the highland to the agricultural frontier on the coast .

<section_title_start> president juan jos flores de jure territorial claims <section_title_end>
since ecuador 's separation from colombia on may 13 , 1830 , it first president , general juan jos flores , laid claim to the territory that wa called the real audiencia of quito , also referred to a the presidencia of quito . he supported his claim with spanish royal decree or real cedulas , that delineated the border of spain 's former overseas colony . in the case of ecuador , flores-based ecuador 's de jure claim on the following cedulas - real cedula of 1563 , 1739 , and 1740 ; with modification in the amazon basin and andes mountain that were introduced through the treaty of guayaquil ( 1829 ) which peru reluctantly signed , after the overwhelmingly outnumbered gran colombian force led by antonio jos de sucre defeated president and general la mar 's peruvian invasion force in the battle of tarqui . in addition , ecuador 's eastern border with the portuguese colony of brazil in the amazon basin wa modified before the war of independence by the first treaty of san ildefonso ( 1777 ) between the spanish empire and the portuguese empire . moreover , to add legitimacy to his claim , on february 16 , 1840 , flores signed a treaty with spain , whereby flores convinced spain to officially recognize ecuadorian independence and it sole right to colonial title over spain 's former colonial territory known anciently to spain a the kingdom and presidency of quito .
ecuador during it long and turbulent history ha lost most of it contested territory to each of it more powerful neighbor , such a colombia in 1832 and 1916 , brazil in 1904 through a series of peaceful treaty , and peru after a short war in which the protocol of rio de janeiro wa signed in 1942.
<section_title_start> struggle for independence <section_title_end>
during the spanish american war of independence , before peru or ecuador became independent nation , a few area of the former vice royalty of new granada - guayaquil , tumbez , and jan - declared themselves independent from spain . a few month later , a part of the peruvian liberation army of san martin decided to occupy the independent city of tumbez and jan with the intention of using these town a springboard to occupy the independent city of guayaquil and then to liberate the rest of the audiencia de quito ( ecuador ) . it wa common knowledge among the top officer of the liberation army from the south that their leader jos de san martn wished to liberate present-day ecuador and add it to the future republic of peru , since it had been part of the inca empire before the spaniard conquered it .
however , simn bolvar 's intention wa to form a new republic known a the gran colombia , out of the liberated spanish territory of new granada which consisted of colombia , venezuela , and ecuador . san martin 's plan were thwarted when simn bolvar , with the help of marshal antonio jos de sucre and the gran colombian liberation force , descended from the andes mountain and occupied guayaquil ; they also annexed the newly liberated audiencia de quito to the republic of gran colombia . this happened a few day before san martin 's peruvian force could arrive and occupy guayaquil , with the intention of annexing guayaquil to the rest of audiencia of quito ( ecuador ) and to the future republic of peru . historic document repeatedly stated that san martin told bolivar he came to guayaquil to liberate the land of the inca from spain . bolivar countered by sending a message from guayaquil welcoming san martin and his troop to colombian soil .
<section_title_start> peruvian occupation of jan , tumbes , and guayaquil <section_title_end>
in the south , ecuador had de jure claim to a small piece of land beside the pacific ocean known a tumbes region which lay between the zarumilla river and tumbes river river . in ecuador 's southern andes mountain region where the maraon cut across , ecuador had de jure claim to an area it called jan , peru . these area were included a part of the territory of gran colombia by bolivar on december 17 , 1819 , during the congress of angostura when the republic of gran colombia wa created . tumbes declared itself independent from spain on january 17 , 1821 , and jaen de bracamoros on june 17 , 1821 , without any outside help from revolutionary army . however , that same year , 1821 , peruvian force participating in the trujillo revolution occupied both jaen and tumbes . some peruvian general , without any legal title backing them up and with ecuador still federated with the gran colombia , had the desire to annex ecuador to the republic of peru at the expense of the gran colombia , feeling that ecuador wa once part of the inca empire .
on july 28 , 1821 , peruvian independence wa proclaimed in lima by the liberator san martin , and tumbes and jaen , which were included a part of the revolution of trujillo by the peruvian occupying force , had the whole region swear allegiance to the new peruvian flag and incorporated itself into peru , even though peru wa not completely liberated from spain . after peru wa completely liberated from spain by the patriot army led by bolivar and antonio jose de sucre at the battle of ayacucho dated december 9 , 1824 , there wa a strong desire by some peruvian to resurrect the inca empire and to include bolivia and ecuador . one of these peruvian general wa the ecuadorian-born jos de la mar , who became one of peru 's president after bolivar resigned a dictator of peru and returned to colombia . gran colombia had always protested peru for the return of jaen and tumbes for almost a decade , then finally bolivar after long and futile discussion over the return of jaen , tumbes , and part of mainas , declared war . president and general jos de la mar , who wa born in ecuador , believing his opportunity had come to annex the district of ecuador to peru , personally , with a peruvian force , invaded and occupied guayaquil and a few city in the loja region of southern ecuador on november 28 , 1828.
the war ended when a triumphant heavily outnumbered southern gran colombian army at battle of tarqui dated february 27 , 1829 , led by antonio jos de sucre , defeated the peruvian invasion force led by president la mar . this defeat led to the signing of the treaty of guayaquil dated september 22 , 1829 , whereby peru and it congress recognized gran colombian right over tumbes , jaen , and maynas . through protocolized meeting between representative of peru and gran colombia , the border wa set a tumbes river in the west and in the east the maranon and amazon river were to be followed toward brazil a the most natural border between them . however , what wa pending wa whether the new border around the jaen region should follow the chinchipe river or the huancabamba river . according to the peace negotiation peru agreed to return guayaquil , tumbez , and jan ; despite this , peru returned guayaquil , but failed to return tumbes and jan , alleging that it wa not obligated to follow the agreement , since the gran colombia ceased to exist when it divided itself into three different nation - ecuador , colombia , and venezuela .
<section_title_start> the dissolution of gran colombia <section_title_end>
the central district of the gran colombia , known a cundinamarca or new granada ( modern colombia ) with it capital in bogota , did not recognize the separation of the southern district of the gran colombia , with it capital in quito , from the gran colombian federation on may 13 , 1830 . after ecuador 's separation , the department of cauca voluntarily decided to unite itself with ecuador due to instability in the central government of bogota . the venezuelan born president of ecuador , the general juan jos flores , with the approval of the ecuadorian congress annexed the department of cauca on december 20 , 1830 , since the government of cauca had called for union with the district of the south a far back a april 1830 . moreover , the cauca region , throughout it long history , had very strong economic and cultural tie with the people of ecuador . also , the cauca region , which included such city a pasto , colombia , popayn , and buenaventura , valle del cauca , had always been dependent on the presidencia or audiencia of quito .
fruitless negotiation continued between the government of bogot and quito , where the government of bogot did not recognize the separation of ecuador or that of cauca from the gran colombia until war broke out in may 1832 . in five month , new granada defeated ecuador due to the fact that the majority of the ecuadorian armed force were composed of rebellious angry unpaid veteran from venezuela and colombia that did not want to fight against their fellow countryman . seeing that his officer were rebelling , mutinying , and changing side , president flores had no option but to reluctantly make peace with new granada . the treaty of pasto of 1832 wa signed by which the department of cauca wa turned over to new granada ( modern colombia ) , the government of bogot recognized ecuador a an independent country and the border wa to follow the ley de divisin territorial de la repblica de colombia ( law of the division of territory of the gran colombia ) passed on june 25 , 1824 . this law set the border at the river carchi and the eastern border that stretched to brazil at the caquet river . later , ecuador contended that the republic of colombia , while reorganizing it government , unlawfully made it eastern border provisional and that colombia extended it claim south to the napo river because it said that the government of popayn extended it control all the way to the napo river .
<section_title_start> struggle for possession of the amazon basin <section_title_end>
when ecuador seceded from the gran colombia , peru decided not to follow the treaty of guayaquil of 1829 or the protocoled agreement made . peru contested ecuador 's claim with the newly discovered real cedula of 1802 , by which peru claim the king of spain had transferred these land from the viceroyalty of new granada to the viceroyalty of peru . during colonial time this wa to halt the ever-expanding portuguese settlement into spanish domain , which were left vacant and in disorder after the expulsion of jesuit missionary from their base along the amazon basin . ecuador countered by labeling the cedula of 1802 an ecclesiastical instrument , which had nothing to do with political border . peru began it de facto occupation of disputed amazonian territory , after it signed a secret 1851 peace treaty in favor of brazil . this treaty disregarded spanish right that were confirmed during colonial time by a spanish-portuguese treaty over the amazon regarding territory held by illegal portuguese settler .
peru began occupying the defenseless missionary village in the mainas or maynas region , which it began calling loreto , with it capital in iquitos . during it negotiation with brazil , peru stated that based on the royal cedula of 1802 , it claimed amazonian basin territory up to caqueta river in the north and toward the andes mountain range , depriving ecuador and colombia of all their claim to the amazon basin . colombia protested stating that it claim extended south toward the napo and amazon river . ecuador protested that it claimed the amazon basin between the caqueta river and the maraon-amazon river . peru ignored these protest and created the department of loreto in 1853 with it capital in iquitos which it had recently invaded and systematically began to occupy using the river system in all the territory claimed by both colombia and ecuador . peru briefly occupied guayaquil again in 1860 , since peru thought that ecuador wa selling some of the disputed land for development to british bond holder , but returned guayaquil after a few month . the border dispute wa then submitted to spain for arbitration from 1880 to 1910 , but to no avail .
in the early part of the 20th century , ecuador made an effort to peacefully define it eastern amazonian border with it neighbour through negotiation . on may 6 , 1904 , ecuador signed the tobar-rio branco treaty recognizing brazil 's claim to the amazon in recognition of ecuador 's claim to be an amazonian country to counter peru 's earlier treaty with brazil back on october 23 , 1851 . then after a few meeting with the colombian government 's representative an agreement wa reached and the muoz vernaza-suarez treaty wa signed july 15 , 1916 , in which colombian right to the putumayo river were recognized a well a ecuador 's right to the napo river and the new border wa a line that ran midpoint between those two river . in this way , ecuador gave up the claim it had to the amazonian territory between the caquet river and napo river to colombia , thus cutting itself off from brazil . later , a brief war erupted between colombia and peru , over peru 's claim to the caquet region , which ended with peru reluctantly signing the salomon-lozano treaty on march 24 , 1922 . ecuador protested this secret treaty , since colombia gave away ecuadorian claimed land to peru that ecuador had given to colombia in 1916.
on july 21 , 1924 , the ponce-castro oyanguren protocol wa signed between ecuador and peru where both agreed to hold direct negotiation and to resolve the dispute in an equitable manner and to submit the differing point of the dispute to the united state for arbitration . negotiation between the ecuadorian and peruvian representative began in washington on september 30 , 1935 . these negotiation were long and tiresome . both side logically presented their case , but no one seemed to give up their claim . then on february 6 , 1937 , ecuador presented a transactional line which peru rejected the next day . the negotiation turned into intense argument during the next 7 month and finally on september 29 , 1937 , the peruvian representative decided to break off the negotiation without submitting the dispute to arbitration because the direct negotiation were going nowhere .
four year later in 1941 , amid fast-growing tension within disputed territory around the zarumilla river , war broke out with peru . peru claimed that ecuador 's military presence in peruvian-claimed territory wa an invasion ; ecuador , for it part , claimed that peru had recently invaded ecuador around the zarumilla river and that peru since ecuador 's independence from spain ha systematically occupied tumbez , jaen , and most of the disputed territory in the amazonian basin between the putomayo and maraon river . in july 1941 , troop were mobilized in both country . peru had an army of 11,681 troop who faced a poorly supplied and inadequately armed ecuadorian force of 2,300 , of which only 1,300 were deployed in the southern province . hostility erupted on july 5 , 1941 , when peruvian force crossed the zarumilla river at several location , testing the strength and resolve of the ecuadorian border troop . finally , on july 23 , 1941 , the peruvian launched a major invasion , crossing the zarumilla river in force and advancing into the ecuadorian province of el oro province .
during the course of the ecuadorianperuvian war , peru gained control over part of the disputed territory and some part of the province of el oro , and some part of the loja province , demanding that the ecuadorian government give up it territorial claim . the peruvian navy blocked the port of guayaquil , almost cutting all supply to the ecuadorian troop . after a few week of war and under pressure by the united state and several latin american nation , all fighting came to a stop . ecuador and peru came to an accord formalized in the rio protocol , signed on january 29 , 1942 , in favor of hemispheric unity against the axis power in world war ii favouring peru with the territory they occupied at the time the war came to an end .
the 1944 glorious may revolution followed a military-civilian rebellion and a subsequent civic strike which successfully removed carlos arroyo del ro a a dictator from ecuador 's government . however , a post-second world war recession and popular unrest led to a return to populist politics and domestic military intervention in the 1960s , while foreign company developed oil resource in the ecuadorian amazon . in 1972 , construction of the andean pipeline wa completed . the pipeline brought oil from the east side of the andes to the coast , making ecuador south america 's second largest oil exporter . the pipeline in southern ecuador did nothing to resolve tension between ecuador and peru , however .
the rio protocol failed to precisely resolve the border along a little river in the remote cordillera del cndor region in southern ecuador . this caused a long-simmering dispute between ecuador and peru , which ultimately led to fighting between the two country ; first a border skirmish in januaryfebruary 1981 known a the paquisha incident , and ultimately full-scale warfare in january 1995 where the ecuadorian military shot down peruvian aircraft and helicopter and peruvian infantry marched into southern ecuador . each country blamed the other for the onset of hostility , known a the cenepa war . sixto durn balln , the ecuadorian president , famously declared that he would not give up a single centimeter of ecuador . popular sentiment in ecuador became strongly nationalism against peru : graffiti could be seen on the wall of quito referring to peru a the `` cain de latinoamrica '' , a reference to the murder of abel by his brother cain in the book of genesis .
ecuador and peru signed the brasilia presidential act peace agreement on october 26 , 1998 , which ended hostility , and effectively put an end to the western hemisphere 's longest running territorial dispute . the guarantor of the rio protocol ( argentina , brazil , chile , and the united state of america ) ruled that the border of the undelineated zone wa to be set at the line of the cordillera del cndor . while ecuador had to give up it decades-old territorial claim to the eastern slope of the cordillera , a well a to the entire western area of cenepa headwater , peru wa compelled to give to ecuador , in perpetual lease but without sovereignty , of it territory , in the area where the ecuadorian base of tiwinza  focal point of the war  had been located within peruvian soil and which the ecuadorian army held during the conflict . the final border demarcation came into effect on may 13 , 1999 and the multi-national momep ( military observer mission for ecuador and peru ) troop deployment withdrew on june 17 , 1999.

in 1972 , a `` revolutionary and nationalist '' military military dictatorship overthrew the government of velasco ibarra . the coup d'tat wa led by general guillermo rodrguez ( politician ) and executed by navy commander jorge queirolo g. the new president exiled jos mara velasco to argentina . he remained in power until 1976 , when he wa removed by another military government . that military junta wa led by admiral alfredo poveda , who wa declared chairman of the supreme council . the supreme council included two other member : general guillermo durn arcentales and general luis leoro franco . the civil society more and more insistently called for democratic election . colonel richelieu levoyer , government minister , proposed and implemented a plan to return to the constitutional system through universal election . this plan enabled the new democratically elected president to assume the duty of the executive office .
<section_title_start> return to democracy <section_title_end>
election were held on april 29 , 1979 , under a new constitution . jaime rolds aguilera wa elected president , garnering over one million vote , the most in ecuadorian history . he took office on august 10 , a the first constitutionally elected president after nearly a decade of civilian and military dictatorship . in 1980 , he founded the partido pueblo , cambio y democracia ( people , change , and democracy party ) after withdrawing from the concentracin de fuerzas populares ( popular force concentration ) and governed until may 24 , 1981 , when he died along with his wife and the minister of defense , marco subia martinez , when his air force plane crashed in heavy rain near the peruvian border . many people believe that he wa assassinated by the cia , given the multiple death threat leveled against him because of his reformist agenda , death in automobile crash of two key witness before they could testify during the investigation , and the sometimes contradictory account of the incident .
roldos wa immediately succeeded by vice president osvaldo hurtado , who wa followed in 1984 by len febres cordero from the social christian party . rodrigo borja cevallos of the democratic left ( izquierda democrtica , or id ) party won the presidency in 1988 , running in the runoff election against abdal bucaram ( brother in law of jaime roldos and founder of the ecuadorian roldosist party ) . his government wa committed to improving human right protection and carried out some reform , notably an opening of ecuador to foreign trade . the borja government concluded an accord leading to the disbanding of the small terrorist group , `` alfaro vive , carajo ! '' ( `` alfaro life , dammit ! `` ) , named after eloy alfaro . however , continuing economic problem undermined the popularity of the id , and opposition party gained control of congress in 1999.
the emergence of the amerindian population a an active constituency ha added to the democratic volatility of the country in recent year . the population ha been motivated by government failure to deliver on promise of land reform , lower unemployment and provision of social service , and historical exploitation by the land-holding elite . their movement , along with the continuing destabilizing effort by both the elite and leftist movement , ha led to a deterioration of the executive office . the populace and the other branch of government give the president very little political capital , a illustrated by the most recent removal of president lucio gutirrez from office by congress in april 2005 . vice president alfredo palacio took his place and remained in office until the presidential ecuadorian general election , 2006 , in which rafael correa gained the presidency .
in december 2008 , president correa declared ecuador 's national debt illegitimate , based on the argument that it wa odious debt contracted by corrupt and despotic prior regime . he announced that the country would default on over $ 3 billion worth of bond ; he then pledged to fight creditor in international court and succeeded in reducing the price of outstanding bond by more than 60 % . he brought ecuador into the bolivarian alliance for the america in june 2009 . to date , correa 's administration ha succeeded in reducing the high level of poverty and unemployment in ecuador .
after being elected in 2017 , president lenin moreno 's government adopted economic liberalism policy : reduction of public spending , trade liberalization , flexibility of the labour code , etc . he also left the left-wing bolivarian alliance for the america in august 2018 . the productive development act enshrines an austerity policy , and reduces the development and redistribution policy of the previous mandate . in the area of tax , the authority aim to `` encourage the return of investor '' by granting amnesty to fraudsters and proposing measure to reduce corporate tax . in addition , the government waif the right to tax increase in raw material price and foreign exchange repatriation .

there 's a small east asian community mainly consisting of those of japanese and chinese descent , whose ancestor arrived a miner , farmhand and fisherman in the late 19th century .
in the early year of world war ii , ecuador still admitted a certain number of immigrant , and in 1939 , when several south american country refused to accept 165 jewish refugee from germany aboard the ship koenigstein , ecuador granted them entry permit .
in the early 1900 's there wa immigration from italian , german , portuguese people , french people , briton and greek . in the 1950 's the italian were the third largest national group in term of number of immigrant , since ecuador like mexico and the andean country did not receive a significant total number of immigrant . it can be noted that , after world war i , people from liguria , still constituted the majority of the flow , even though they then represented only one third of the total number of immigrant in ecuador . this situation came from the improvement of the economic situation in liguria . the classic paradigm of the italian immigrant today wa not that of the small trader from liguria a it had been before ; those who emigrated to ecuador were professional and technician , employee and religious people from south-central italy . it must be remembered that many immigrant , a remarkable number of italian among them , moved to the ecuadorian port from peru to escape from the peruvian war with chile . the italian government came to be more interested in the emigration phenomenon in ecuador because of the necessity of finding an outlet for the large number of immigrant who traditionally went to the united state but who could no longer enter this country because of the new measure that imposed restriction in the 1920s . most of these community and their descendant are located in the guayas province region of the country .
in recent year , ecuador ha grown in popularity among north american expatriate .
another perk that draw many expat to ecuador is it low cost of living . since everything from gas to grocery cost far le than in north america , it is a popular choice for those who are looking to make the most of their retirement budget .
<section_title_start> culture <section_title_end>
ecuador 's mainstream culture is defined by it hispanic mestizo majority , and , like their ancestry , it is traditionally of spanish heritage , influenced in different degree by amerindian tradition and in some case by african element . the first and most substantial wave of modern immigration to ecuador consisted of spanish colonist , following the arrival of european in 1499 . a lower number of other european and north american migrated to the country in the late 19th and early 20th century and , in smaller number , pole , lithuanian , english , irish , and croat during and after the second world war .
since african slavery wa not the workforce of the spanish colony in the andes mountain , given the subjugation of the amerindian people through proselytization and encomiendas , the minority population of african descent is mostly found in the coastal northern province of esmeraldas . this is largely owing to the 17th-century shipwreck of a slave-trading galleon off the northern coast of ecuador . the few african survivor swam to the shore and penetrated the then-thick jungle under the leadership of anton , the chief of the group , where they remained a free men maintaining their original culture , not influenced by the typical element found in other province of the coast or in the andean region . a little later , freed slave from colombia known a cimarrones joined them . in the small chota valley of the province of imbabura exists a small community of african among the province 's predominantly mestizo population . these black are descendant of african , who were brought over from colombia by jesuit to work their colonial sugar plantation a slave . a a general rule , small element of zambos and mulatto coexisted among the overwhelming mestizo population of coastal ecuador throughout it history a gold miner in loja , zaruma , and zamora and a shipbuilder and plantation worker around the city of guayaquil . today you can find a small community of african in the catamayo valley of the predominantly mestizo population of loja .
ecuador 's amerindian community are integrated into the mainstream culture to varying degree , but some may also practice their own native culture , particularly the more remote amerindian community of the amazon basin . spanish is spoken a the first language by more than 90 % of the population and a a first or second language by more than 98 % . part of ecuador 's population can speak amerindian language , in some case a a second language . two percent of the population speak only amerindian language .
<section_title_start> language <section_title_end>
most ecuadorian speak spanish a their first language , with it ubiquity permeating and dominating most of the country , though there are many who speak an amerindian language , such a kichwa ( also spelled quechua ) , which is one of the quechuan language and is spoken by approximately 2.5 million people in ecuador , bolivia , colombia , and peru . other amerindian language spoken in ecuador include awapit ( spoken by the aw ) , a'ingae ( spoken by the cofan ) , shuar chicham ( spoken by the shuar ) , achuar-shiwiar ( spoken by the achuar and the shiwiar ) , cha'palaachi ( spoken by the chachi ) , tsa'fiki ( spoken by the tschila ) , paicoca ( spoken by the siona and secoya ) , and wao tededeo ( spoken by the waorani ) . use of these amerindian language are , however , gradually diminishing due to spanish 's widespread use in education . though most feature of ecuadorian spanish are universal to the spanish-speaking world , there are several idiosyncrasy .
<section_title_start> music <section_title_end>

<section_title_start> health <section_title_end>
the current structure of the ecuadorian public health care system date back to 1967 . the ministry of the public health ( ministerio de salud pblica del ecuador ) is the responsible entity of the regulation and creation of the public health policy and health care plan . the minister of public health is appointed directly by the president of the republic . the current minister , or ecuadorian general surgeon , is margarita guevara .
the philosophy of the ministry of public health is the social support and service to the most vulnerable population , and it main plan of action lie around communitarian health and preventive medicine . many usa medical group often visit region away from the big city to provide medical health to poor community at their own expense . it is known a medical mission some are christian organization .
the public healthcare system allows patient to be treated without an appointment in public general hospital by general practitioner and specialist in the outpatient clinic ( consulta externa ) at no cost . this is done in the four basic specialty of pediatric , gynecology , clinic medicine , and surgery . there are also public hospital specialized to treat chronic disease , target a particular group of the population , or provide better treatment in some medical specialty . some example in this group are the gynecologic hospital , or maternity , child hospital , geriatric hospital , and oncology institute .
although well-equipped general hospital are found in the major city or capital of province , there are basic hospital in the smaller town and canton ( country subdivision ) city for family care consultation and treatment in pediatrics , gynecology , clinical medicine , and surgery .
community health care center ( centros de salud ) are found inside metropolitan area of city and in rural area . these are day hospital that provide treatment to patient whose hospitalization is under 24 hour .
the doctor assigned to rural community , where the amerindian population can be substantial , have small clinic under their responsibility for the treatment of patient in the same fashion a the day hospital in the major city . the treatment in this case respect the culture of the community .
the public healthcare system should not be confused with the ecuadorian social security healthcare service , which is dedicated to individual with formal employment and who are affiliated obligatorily through their employer . citizen with no formal employment may still contribute to the social security system voluntarily and have access to the medical service rendered by the social security system . the ecuadorian institute of social security ( y ) ha several major hospital and medical sub-centers under it administration across the nation .
ecuador currently rank 20 , in most world health organization ranking of health system , compared to 111 back in the year 2000 . ecuadorian have a life expectancy of 77.1 year . the infant mortality rate is 13 per 1,000 live birth , a major improvement from approximately 76 in the early 1980s and 140 in 1950 . 23 % of child under five are chronically malnourished . population in some rural area have no access to potable water , and it supply is provided by mean of water tanker . there are 686 malaria case per 100,000 people . basic health care , including doctor 's visit , basic surgery , and basic medication , ha been provided free since 2008 . however , some public hospital are in poor condition and often lack necessary supply to attend the high demand of patient . private hospital and clinic are well equipped but still expensive for the majority of the population .
between 2008 and 2016 , new public hospital have been built , the number of civil servant ha increased significantly and salary have been increased . in 2008 , the government introduced universal and compulsory social security coverage . in 2015 , corruption remains a problem . overbilling is recorded in 20 % of public establishment and in 80 % of private establishment .
<section_title_start> education <section_title_end>
the ecuadorian constitution requires that all child attend school until they achieve a `` basic level of education '' , which is estimated at nine school year . in 1996 , the net primary enrollment rate wa 96.9 % , and 71.8 % of child stayed in school until the fifth grade / age 10 . the cost of primary and secondary education is borne by the government , but family often face significant additional expense such a fee and transportation cost .
provision of public school fall far below the level needed , and class size are often very large , and family of limited mean often find it necessary to pay for education . in rural area , only 10 % of the child go on to high school . the ministry of education state that the mean number of year completed is 6.7.
ecuador ha 61 university , many of which still confer terminal degree according to the traditional spanish education system , honoring a long tradition of having some of the oldest university in the america : university of san fulgencio , founded in 1586 by the augustine ; san gregorio magno university , founded in 1651 by the jesuit ; and university of santo tom of aquino , founded in 1681 by the dominican order .
among the traditional conferred terminal degree can be noted the doctorate for medicine and law school or engineering , physic , chemistry , or mathematics for polytechnic or technology institute . these terminal degree , a in the case of the phd in other country , were the main requirement for an individual to be accepted in academia a a professor or researcher . in the professional realm , a terminal degree granted by an accredited institution automatically provides a professional license to the individual .
however , in 2004 , the national council of higher education ( conesup ) , started the reorganization of all the degree-granting scheme of the accredited university in order to pair them with foreign counterpart . the new structure of some career caused the dropping of subject , credit , or even the name of the previously conferred diploma . the terminal degree in law , previously known a jd juris doctor ( doctor en jurisprudencia ) wa replaced by the one of abogado ( attorney ) with the exception of the modification of the number of credit to equate it to an undergraduate degree . in the same fashion for medical school , the required time of education wa considerably reduced from nine year ( the minimum needed to obtain the title of md in medicine and surgery ) to almost five , with the provision that the diploma is not terminal anymore , and it is given with the title of mdico ( medic ) . therefore , an md or phd in medicine is only to be obtained overseas until the university adjust themselves to granting scheme and curriculum a in foreign counterpart . nonetheless , a `` mdico '' can start a career a family practitioner or general medicine physician .
this new reorganization , although very ambitious , lacked the proper path to the homologation of diploma for highly educated professional graduated in the country or even for the one graduated in foreign institution . one of the point of conflict wa the imposition of obtaining foreign degree to current academician . a today , a master 's degree is a requirement to keep an academic position and at least a foreign phd to attain or retain the status of rector ( president of a university ) or dcano ( dean ) . for ecuadorian researcher and many academician trained in the country , these regulation sounded illogical , disappointing , and unlawful since it appeared a question of a title name conflict rather than specialization or science advancement .
a debate to modify this and other reform , especially the one which granted control of the higher education system by the government , wa practically passed with consensus by the multi-partisan national assembly on august 4 , 2010 , but vetoed by president rafael correa , who wanted to keep the law strictly a it wa originally redacted by his political party and senplades ( national secretary of planning and development ) . due to this change , there are many highly educated professional and academician under the old structure but estimated that only 87 % of the faculty in public university have already obtained a master 's degree , and fewer than 5 % have a phd ( although many of them already have ecuadorian-granted doctorate degree ) .
about 300 institute of higher education offer two to three year of post-secondary vocational or technical training .

ivory coast , also known a cte d'ivoire , officially the republic of cte d'ivoire , is a country located on the south coast of west africa . ivory coast 's political capital is yamoussoukro in the center of the country , while it economic capital and largest city is the port city of abidjan . it border guinea to guineaivory coast border , liberia to ivory coastliberia border , mali to ivory coastmali border , burkina faso to burkina fasoivory coast border , ghana to ghanaivory coast border , and the gulf of guinea ( atlantic ocean ) to the south . the official language of the republic is french language , with local indigenous language also being widely used that include baoul language , dyula language , dan language , anyin language , and senari language . in total , there are around 78 different language of ivory coast . the country ha large population of adherent of christianity in ivory coast , islam in ivory coast and religion in ivory coast .
before it colonization by european , ivory coast wa home to several state , including gyaaman , the kong empire and baoul people . the area became a protectorate of france in 1843 and wa consolidated a a list of french possession and colony in 1893 amid the european scramble for africa . it achieved independence in 1960 , led by flix houphout-boigny , who ruled the country until 1993 . relatively stable by regional standard , ivory coast established close political and economic tie with it west african neighbor while at the same time maintaining close relation to western bloc , franafrique . ivory coast experienced a 1999 ivorian coup d'tat coup d'tat in 1999 and two civil war , first first ivorian civil war and again second ivorian civil war during 20102011 . in 2000 , the country adopted a new constitution .
ivory coast is a republic with strong executive power vested in it list of head of state of ivory coast . through the production of coffee bean and cocoa bean , the country wa an economic powerhouse in west africa during the 1960s and 1970s , though it went through an economic crisis in the 1980s , contributing to a period of political and social turmoil . it wa not until around 2014 that the gross domestic product again reached the level of it peak in the 1970s . in the 21st century , the ivorian economy ha been largely market-based , and it still relies heavily on agriculture , with smallholding cash-crop production being predominant .
<section_title_start>  etymology  <section_title_end>
originally , portuguese and french merchant-explorers in the 15th and 16th century divided the west coast of africa , very roughly , into four `` coast '' reflecting local economy . the coast that the french named the cte d'ivoire and the portuguese named the costa do marfim both , literally , mean `` coast of ivory ''  lay between what wa known a the guin de cabo verde , so-called `` upper guinea '' at cap-vert , and lower guinea . there wa also a pepper coast , also known a the `` pepper coast '' ( present-day liberia ) , a `` gold coast ( region ) '' ( ghana ) , and a `` slave coast of west africa '' ( togo , benin and nigeria ) . like those , the name `` ivory coast '' reflected the major trade that occurred on that particular stretch of the coast : the export of ivory .
other name included the cte de dent , literally `` coast of teeth '' , again reflecting the trade in ivory ; the cte de quaqua , after the people whom the dutch named the quaqua ( alternatively kwa kwa ) ; the coast of the five and six stripe , after a type of cotton fabric also traded there ; and the cte du vent , the windward coast , after perennial local off-shore weather condition . one can find the name cote de ( s ) dent regularly used in older work . it wa used in duckett 's dictionnaire and by nicolas villault de bellefond , for example , although abb prvost used cte d'ivoire . in the 19th century , usage switched to cte d'ivoire .
the coastline of the modern state is not quite coterminous with what the 15th- and 16th-century merchant knew a the `` teeth '' or `` ivory '' coast , which wa considered to stretch from cape palmas to cape three point and which is thus now divided between the modern state of ghana and ivory coast ( with a minute portion of liberia ) . it retained the name through french rule and independence in 1960 . the name had long since been translated literally into other language , which the post-independence government considered increasingly troublesome whenever it international dealing extended beyond the francophone sphere . therefore , in april 1986 , the government declared that cte d'ivoire ( or , more fully , rpublique de cte d'ivoire ) would be it formal name for the purpose of diplomatic protocol , and since then officially refuse to recognize or accept any translation from french to another language in it international dealing .
despite the ivorian government 's request , the english translation `` ivory coast '' ( often `` the ivory coast '' ) is still frequently used in english by various medium outlet and publication .

the first human presence in ivory coast ha been difficult to determine because human remains have not been well preserved in the country 's humid climate . however , newly found weapon and tool fragment ( specifically , polished ax cut through shale and remnant of cooking and fishing ) have been interpreted a a possible indication of a large human presence during the upper paleolithic period ( 15,000 to 10,000 bc ) , or at the minimum , the neolithic period .
the earliest known inhabitant of ivory coast have left trace scattered throughout the territory . historian believe that they were all either displaced or absorbed by the ancestor of the present indigenous inhabitant , who migrated south into the area before the 16th century . such group included the ehotil ( aboisso ) , kotrowou ( fresco ) , zhiri ( grand lahou ) , ega and dis ( divo , ivory coast ) .
<section_title_start> pre-islamic and islamic periods <section_title_end>
the first recorded history appears in the chronicle of north african ( berber people ) trader , who , from early roman time , conducted a caravan ( traveller ) trade across the sahara in salt , slave , gold , and other good . the southern terminal of the trans-saharan trade route were located on the edge of the desert , and from there supplemental trade extended a far south a the edge of the rain forest . the most important terminalsdjenn , gao , and timbuctugrew into major commercial centre around which the great sudanic empire developed .
by controlling the trade route with their powerful military force , these empire were able to dominate neighbouring state . the sudanic empire also became centre of islamic study . islam had been introduced in the sudan ( region ) by muslim berber trader from north africa ; it spread rapidly after the conversion of many important ruler . from the 11th century , by which time the ruler of the sudanic empire had embraced islam , it spread south into the northern area of contemporary ivory coast .
the ghana empire , the earliest of the sudanic empire , flourished in the region encompassing present-day southeast mauritania and southern mali between the 4th and 13th century . at the peak of it power in the 11th century , it realm extended from the atlantic ocean to timbuktu . after the decline of ghana , the mali empire grew into a powerful muslim state , which reached it apogee in the early part of the 14th century . the territory of the mali empire in ivory coast wa limited to the north-west corner around odienn .
it slow decline starting at the end of the 14th century followed internal discord and revolt by vassal state , one of which , songhai empire , flourished a an empire between the 14th and 16th century . songhai wa also weakened by internal discord , which led to factional warfare . this discord spurred most of the human migration southward toward the forest belt . the dense rain forest covering the southern half of the country , created barrier to the large-scale political organization that had arisen in the north . inhabitant lived in village or cluster of village ; their contact with the outside world were filtered through long-distance trader . villager subsisted on subsistence agriculture and hunting .
<section_title_start> pre-european modern period <section_title_end>
five important state flourished in ivory coast during the pre-european early modern period . the muslim kong empire wa established by the jola people in the early 18th century in the north-central region inhabited by the snoufo , who had fled islamization under the mali empire . although kong became a prosperous center of agriculture , trade , and craft , ethnic diversity and religious discord gradually weakened the kingdom . in 1895 the city of kong would be sacked and conquered by samori ture of the wassoulou empire .
the abron tribe kingdom of gyaaman wa established in the 15th century by an akan people group , the abron , who had fled the developing ashanti people confederation of asanteman in what is present-day ghana . from their settlement south of bondoukou , the abron gradually extended their hegemony over the dyula people in bondoukou , who were recent arrival from the market city of begho . bondoukou developed into a major center of commerce and islam . the kingdom 's quranic scholar attracted student from all part of west africa . in the mid-17th century in east-central ivory coast , other akan group fleeing the asante established a baoul people kingdom at sakasso and two anyi people kingdom , indni-djuablin and sanwi .
the baoul , like the ashanti , developed a highly centralized political and administrative structure under three successive ruler . it finally split into smaller chiefdoms . despite the breakup of their kingdom , the baoul strongly resisted french subjugation . the descendant of the ruler of the agni kingdom tried to retain their separate identity long after ivory coast 's independence ; a late a 1969 , the sanwi attempted to break away from ivory coast and form an independent kingdom . the current king of sanwi is amon n'douffou v ( since 2005 ) .
<section_title_start> establishment of french rule <section_title_end>
compared to neighboring ghana , ivory coast , though practicing slavery and slave raiding , suffered little from the slave trade . european slave and merchant ship preferred other area along the coast . the earliest recorded european voyage to west africa wa made by the portuguese in 1482 . the first west african french settlement , saint louis , senegal , wa founded in the mid-17th century in senegal , while at about the same time , the dutch ceded to the french a settlement at gore , off dakar . a french missionary wa established in 1637 at assinie near the border with the gold coast ( british colony ) ( now ghana ) . the european suppressed the local practice of slavery at this time and forbade the trade to their merchant .
assinie 's survival wa precarious , however ; the french were not firmly established in ivory coast until the mid-19th century . in 18434 , french admiral louis edouard bout-willaumez signed treaty with the king of the grand bassam and assinie region , making their territory a french protectorate . french exploration , missionary , trading company , and soldier gradually extended the area under french control inland from the lagoon region . pacification wa not accomplished until 1915.
activity along the coast stimulated european interest in the interior , especially along the two great river , the senegal river and the niger river . concerted french exploration of west africa began in the mid-19th century , but moved slowly , based more on individual initiative than on government policy . in the 1840s , the french concluded a series of treaty with local west african chief that enabled the french to build fortified post along the gulf of guinea to serve a permanent trading centre .
the first post in ivory coast included one at assinie and another at grand bassam , which became the colony 's first capital . the treaty provided for french sovereignty within the post , and for trading privilege in exchange for fee or coutumes paid annually to the local chief for the use of the land . the arrangement wa not entirely satisfactory to the french , because trade wa limited and misunderstanding over treaty obligation often arose . nevertheless , the french government maintained the treaty , hoping to expand trade .
france also wanted to maintain a presence in the region to stem the increasing influence of the british along the gulf of guinea coast . the french built naval base to keep out non-french trader and began a systematic pacification of the interior to stop raid on their settlement . they accomplished this only after a long war in the 1890s against mandinka people tribesman , mostly from the gambia . however , raid by the baoul and other eastern tribe continued until 1917.
the defeat of france in the franco-prussian war in 1871 and the subsequent annexation by germany of the french province of alsace-lorraine caused the french government to abandon it colonial ambition and withdraw it military garrison from it west african trading post , leaving them in the care of resident merchant . the trading post at grand bassam in ivory coast wa left in the care of a shipper from marseille , arthur verdier , who in 1878 wa named resident ( title ) of the establishment of ivory coast .
in 1886 , to support it claim of effective occupation , france again assumed direct control of it west african coastal trading post and embarked on an accelerated program of exploration in the interior . in 1887 , lieutenant louis gustave binger began a two-year journey that traversed part of ivory coast 's interior . by the end of the journey , he had concluded four treaty establishing french protectorate in ivory coast . also in 1887 , verdier 's agent , marcel treich-laplne , negotiated five additional agreement that extended french influence from the headwater of the niger river basin through ivory coast .
<section_title_start> french colonial era <section_title_end>
by the end of the 1880s , france had established control over the coastal region of ivory coast , and in 1889 britain recognized french sovereignty in the area . that same year , france named treich-laplne titular governor of the territory . in 1893 , ivory coast became a french colony , and captain binger wa appointed governor . agreement with liberia in 1892 and with britain in 1893 determined the eastern and western boundary of the colony , but the northern boundary wa not fixed until 1947 because of effort by the french government to attach part of upper volta ( present-day burkina faso ) and french sudan ( present-day mali ) to ivory coast for economic and administrative reason .
france 's main goal wa to stimulate the production of export . coffee , cocoa , and palm oil crop were soon planted along the coast . ivory coast stood out a the only west african country with a sizeable population of settler ; elsewhere in west and central africa , the french and british were largely bureaucrat . a a result , french citizen owned one-third of the cocoa , coffee , and banana plantation and adopted the local forced-labor system .
throughout the early year of french rule , french military contingent were sent inland to establish new post . some of the native population and former slave-owning class resisted french settler . among those offering greatest resistance wa samori ture , who in the 1880s and 1890s wa conquering his neighbor , re-establishing slavery and founding the wassoulou empire , which extended over large part of present-day guinea , mali , burkina faso , and ivory coast . samori ture 's large , well-equipped army , which could manufacture and repair it own firearm , attracted some support throughout the region from chief who sought to play the two side off against each other . the french responded to samori ture 's expansion and conquest with military pressure . french campaign against samori ture , which were met with greater resistance than usual in tribal warfare , intensified in the mid-1890s until he wa captured in 1898 and his empire dissolved .
france 's imposition of a tax per head in 1900 to support the colony 's public work program provoked unexpected protest . many ivoirians saw the tax a a violation of the protectorate treaty because they felt that france wa demanding the equivalent of a coutume from the local king , rather than the reverse . many , especially in the interior , also considered the tax a humiliating symbol of submission . in 1905 , the french officially abolished african slave trade in most of french west africa . from 1904 to 1958 , ivory coast wa part of the federation of french west africa . it wa a colony and an overseas territory under the french third republic . in world war i , france organized regiment from ivory coast to fight in france , and colony resource were rationed from 1917 to 1919 . until the period following world war ii , governmental affair in french west africa were administered from paris . france 's policy in west africa wa reflected mainly in it philosophy of `` association '' , meaning that all african in ivory coast were officially french `` subject '' , but without right to representation in africa or france .
french colonial empire # second french colonial empire incorporated concept of cultural assimilation and association . based on the assumed superiority of french culture , in practice the assimilation policy meant the extension of french language , institution , law , and custom to the colony . the policy of association also affirmed the superiority of the french in the colony , but it entailed different institution and system of law for the colonizer and the colonized . under this policy , the african in ivory coast were allowed to preserve their own custom insofar a they were compatible with french interest , such a the recent abolition of the slave trade .
an indigenous elite trained in french administrative practice formed an intermediary group between french and african . after 1930 , a small number of westernized ivoirians were granted the right to apply for french citizenship . most ivoirians , however , were classified a french subject and were governed under the principle of association . a subject of france , native outside the above-mentioned civilized elite had no political right . they were drafted for work in mine , on plantation , a porter , and on public project a part of their tax responsibility . they were expected to serve in the military and were subject to the indignat , a separate system of law .
in world war ii , the vichy regime remained in control until 1942 , when british troop invaded without much resistance . winston churchill gave power back to member of general charles de gaulle 's provisional government . by 1943 , the ally had returned french west africa to the french . the brazzaville conference of 1944 , the first constituent assembly of the french fourth republic in 1946 , and france 's gratitude for african loyalty during world war ii , led to far-reaching governmental reform in 1946 . french citizenship wa granted to all african `` subject '' , the right to organize politically wa recognized , and various form of forced labor were abolished . between the year 19441946 many national conference and constituent assembly took place between france 's vichy regime and provisional government in ivory coast . governmental reform were established by late 1946 , which granted french citizenship to all african `` subject '' under the colonial control of the french .
until 1958 , governor appointed in paris administered the colony of ivory coast , using a system of direct , centralized administration that left little room for ivoirian participation in policy-making . while british colonial administration adopted divide-and-rule policy elsewhere , applying idea of assimilation only to the educated elite , the french were interested in ensuring that the small but influential elite wa sufficiently satisfied with the status quo to refrain from anti-french sentiment . although strongly opposed to the practice of association , educated ivoirians believed that they would achieve equality with their french peer through assimilation rather than through complete independence from france . after the assimilation doctrine wa implemented through the postwar reform , though , ivoirian leader realized that even assimilation implied the superiority of the french over the ivoirians . some of them thought that discrimination and political inequality would end only with independence ; others thought the problem of the division between the tribal culture and modernity would continue .
<section_title_start> independence <section_title_end>
flix houphout-boigny , the son of a baoul people , became ivory coast 's father of independence . in 1944 , he formed the country 's first agricultural trade union for african cocoa farmer like himself . angered that colonial policy favoured french plantation owner , the union member united to recruit migrant worker for their own farm . houphout-boigny soon rose to prominence and within a year wa elected to the french parliament in paris . a year later , the french abolished forced labour . houphout-boigny established a strong relationship with the french government , expressing a belief that ivory coast would benefit from the relationship , which it did for many year . france appointed him a a minister , the first african to become a minister in a european government .
a turning point in relation with france wa reached with the 1956 loi-cadre defferre ( loi cadre ) , which transferred a number of power from paris to elected territorial government in french west africa and also removed the remaining voting inequity . on 4 december 1958 , ivory coast became an autonomous member of the french community , which had replaced the french union .
at independence ( 1960 ) , the country wa easily french west africa 's most prosperous , contributing over 40 % of the region 's total export . when houphout-boigny became the first president , his government gave farmer good price for their product to further stimulate production , which wa further boosted by a significant immigration of worker from surrounding country . coffee production increased significantly , catapulting ivory coast into third place in world output , behind brazil and colombia . by 1979 , the country wa the world 's leading producer of cocoa . it also became africa 's leading exporter of pineapple and palm oil . french technician contributed to the `` ivoirian miracle '' . in other african nation , the people drove out the european following independence , but in ivory coast , they poured in . the french community grew from only 30,000 prior to independence to 60,000 in 1980 , most of them teacher , manager , and advisor . for 20 year , the economy maintained an annual growth rate of nearly 10 % the highest of africa 's non-oil-exporting country .
<section_title_start> houphout-boigny administration <section_title_end>
houphout-boigny 's one-party rule wa not amenable to political competition . laurent gbagbo , who would become the president of ivory coast in 2000 , had to flee the country in the 1980s , after he incurred the ire of houphout-boigny by founding the ivoirian popular front . houphout-boigny banked on his broad appeal to the population , who continued to elect him . he wa criticized for his emphasis on developing large-scale project .
many felt the million of dollar spent transforming his home village , yamoussoukro , into the new political capital were wasted ; others supported his vision to develop a centre for peace , education , and religion in the heart of the country . in the early 1980s , the world recession and a local drought sent shock wave through the ivoirian economy . due to the overcutting of timber and collapsing sugar price , the country 's external debt increased three-fold . crime rose dramatically in abidjan a an influx of villager exacerbated unemployment caused by the recession .
in 1990 , hundred of civil servant went on strike , joined by student protesting institutional corruption . the unrest forced the government to support multiparty democracy . houphout-boigny became increasingly feeble , and died in 1993 . he favoured henri konan bdi a his successor .
<section_title_start> bdi administration <section_title_end>
in october 1995 , bdi overwhelmingly won re-election against a fragmented and disorganised opposition . he tightened his hold over political life , jailing several hundred opposition supporter . in contrast , the economic outlook improved , at least superficially , with decreasing inflation and an attempt to remove foreign debt .
unlike houphout-boigny , who wa very careful to avoid any ethnic conflict and left access to administrative position open to immigrant from neighbouring country , bedi emphasized the concept of ivoirit to exclude his rival alassane ouattara , who had two northern ivorian parent , from running for future presidential election . a people originating from foreign country are a large part of the ivoirian population , this policy excluded many people from ivoirian nationality , and the relationship between various ethnic group became strained , which resulted in two civil war in the following decade .
<section_title_start> 1999 military coup <section_title_end>
similarly , bedi excluded many potential opponent from the army . in late 1999 , a group of dissatisfied officer staged a 1999 ivorian coup d'tat , putting general robert gu in power . bedi fled into exile in france . the new leadership reduced crime and corruption , and the general pressed for austerity and campaigned in the street for a le wasteful society .
<section_title_start> gbagbo administration <section_title_end>
a presidential election wa held in october 2000 in which laurent gbagbo vied with gu , but it wa not peaceful . the lead-up to the election wa marked by military and civil unrest . following a public uprising that resulted in around 180 death , gu wa swiftly replaced by gbagbo . alassane ouattara wa disqualified by the country 's supreme court , due to his alleged burkina faso nationality . the existing and later reformed constitution [ under gu ] did not allow noncitizen to run for the presidency . this sparked violent protest in which his supporter , mainly from the country 's north , battled riot police in the capital , yamoussoukro .
<section_title_start> ivorian civil war <section_title_end>
in the early hour of 19 september 2002 , while the president wa in italy , an armed uprising occurred . troop who were to be demobilised mutinied , launching attack in several city . the battle for the main gendarmerie barrack in abidjan lasted until mid-morning , but by lunchtime , the government force had secured abidjan . they had lost control of the north of the country , and rebel force made their stronghold in the northern city of bouak .
the rebel threatened to move on abidjan again , and france deployed troop from it base in the country to stop their advance . the french said they were protecting their own citizen from danger , but their deployment also helped government force . that the french were helping either side wa not established a a fact , but each side accused the french of supporting the opposite side . whether french action improved or worsened the situation in the long term is disputed . what exactly happened that night is also disputed . the government claimed that former president robert gu led a coup attempt , and state tv showed picture of his dead body in the street ; counter-claims stated that he and 15 others had been murdered at his home , and his body had been moved to the street to incriminate him . alassane ouattara took refuge in the german embassy ; his home had been burned down . president gbagbo cut short his trip to italy and on his return stated , in a television address , that some of the rebel were hiding in the shanty town where foreign migrant worker lived . gendarme and vigilante bulldozed and burned home by the thousand , attacking resident .
an early ceasefire with the rebel , which had the backing of much of the northern populace , proved short-lived , and fighting over the prime cocoa-growing area resumed . france sent in troop to maintain the cease-fire boundary , and militia , including warlord and fighter from liberia and sierra leone , took advantage of the crisis to seize part of the west .
<section_title_start> 2002 unity government <section_title_end>
in january 2003 , gbagbo and rebel leader signed accord creating a `` government of national unity '' . curfew were lifted , and french troop patrolled the western border of the country . the unity government wa unstable , and central problem remained , with neither side achieving it goal . in march 2004 , 120 people were killed at an opposition rally , and subsequent mob violence led to the evacuation of foreign national . a later report concluded the killing were planned . though un peacekeeper were deployed to maintain a `` zone of confidence '' , relation between gbagbo and the opposition continued to deteriorate .
early in november 2004 , after the peace agreement had effectively collapsed because the rebel refused to disarm , gbagbo ordered airstrikes against the rebel . during 2004 frenchivorian clash in bouak , on 6 november 2004 , french soldier were hit , and nine were killed ; the ivorian government said it wa a mistake , but the french claimed it wa deliberate . they responded by destroying most ivoirian military aircraft ( two su-25 plane and five helicopter ) , and violent retaliatory riot against the french broke out in abidjan .
gbagbo 's original term a president expired on 30 october 2005 , but due to the lack of disarmament , an election wa deemed impossible , so his term in office wa extended for a maximum of one year , according to a plan worked out by the african union and endorsed by the united nation security council . with the late-october deadline approaching in 2006 , the election wa regarded a very unlikely to be held by that point , and the opposition and the rebel rejected the possibility of another term extension for gbagbo . the un security council endorsed another one-year extension of gbagbo 's term on 1 november 2006 ; however , the resolution provided for strengthening of prime minister charles konan banny 's power . gbagbo said the next day that element of the resolution deemed to be constitutional violation would not be applied .
a peace accord between the government and the rebel , or force nouvelles de cte d'ivoire , wa signed on 4 march 2007 , and subsequently guillaume soro , leader of the new force , became prime minister . these event were seen by some observer a substantially strengthening gbagbo 's position .
according to unicef , at the end of the civil war , water and sanitation infrastructure had been greatly damaged . community across the country required repair to their water supply .
<section_title_start> 2010 election <section_title_end>
the presidential election that should have been organized in 2005 were postponed until november 2010 . the preliminary result announced independently by the president of the electoral commission from the headquarters of ouattara due to concern about fraud in that commission . they showed a loss for gbagbo in favour of former prime minister alassane ouattara .
the ruling fpi contested the result before the constitutional council ( ivory coast ) , charging massive fraud in the northern department controlled by the rebel of the new force . these charge were contradicted by united nation observer ( unlike african union observer ) . the report of the result led to severe tension and violent incident . the constitutional council , which consisted of gbagbo supporter , declared the result of seven northern department unlawful and that gbagbo had won the election with 51 % of the vote  instead of ouattara winning with 54 % , a reported by the electoral commission . after the inauguration of gbagbo , ouattarawho wa recognized a the winner by most country and the united nationsorganized an alternative inauguration . these event raised fear of a resurgence of the civil war ; thousand of refugee fled the country .
the african union sent thabo mbeki , former president of south africa , to mediate the conflict . the united nation security council adopted a resolution recognising alassane ouattara a winner of the election , based on the position of the economic community of west african state , which suspended ivory coast from all it decision-making body while the african union also suspended the country 's membership .
in 2010 , a colonel of ivory coast armed force , nguessan yao , wa arrested in new york in a year-long u.s. immigration and custom enforcement operation charged with procuring and illegal export of weapon and munition : 4,000 9 mm handgun , 200,000 round of ammunition , and 50,000 tear-gas grenade , in violation of a un embargo . several other ivory coast officer were released because they had diplomatic passport . his accomplice , michael barry shor , an international trader , wa located in virginia .
<section_title_start> 2011 civil war <section_title_end>
the 2010 presidential election led to the 20102011 ivorian crisis and the second ivorian civil war . international organization reported numerous human-rights violation by both side . in the city of dukou , hundred of people were killed . in nearby blolquin , dozen were killed . un and french force took military action against gbagbo . gbagbo wa taken into custody after a raid into his residence on 11 april 2011 . the country wa severely damaged by the war , and it wa observed that ouattara had inherited a formidable challenge to rebuild the economy and reunite ivorians . gbagbo wa taken to the international criminal court in the hague in january 2016 . he wa declared acquitted by the court but given a conditional release in january 2019 . belgium ha been designated a a host country .

<section_title_start>  name and etymology  <section_title_end>
the english language name of `` singapore '' is an anglicisation of the native malay language name for the country , wikt : singapura # malay , which wa in turn derived from the sanskrit word for `` lion city '' ( international alphabet of sanskrit transliteration romanised : wikt :  # sanskrit ; brahmi script :  ; literally `` lion city '' ; wikt :  # sanskrit mean `` lion '' , wikt :  # sanskrit mean `` city '' or `` fortress '' ) . a chinese account from the third century referred to a place a pulau ujong ( ) , which sound like malay language for `` island at the end of malay peninsula '' . early reference to the name temasek ( or tumasik ) are found in the nagarakretagama , a java ( island ) epic poem written in 1365 , and a vietnamese source from the same time period . the name possibly mean `` sea town '' , being derived from the malay language tasek , meaning `` sea '' or `` lake '' . the chinese people traveller wang dayuan visited a place around 1330 named danmaxi ( ) or tam ma siak , depending on pronunciation . danmaxi may be a transcription of temasek temasek ( tumasik ) , alternatively , it may be a combination of the malay language tanah meaning `` land '' , and chinese language xi meaning `` tin '' , which wa traded on the island .
variation of the name sihapura were used for a number of city throughout the region prior to the establishment of the kingdom of singapura . in hindu-buddhist culture , lion were associated with power and protection , which may explain the attraction of such a name . the name singapura supplanted temasek sometime before the 15th century , after the establishment of the kingdom of singapura on the island by a fleeing srivijayan raja ( prince ) from palembang . however , the precise time and reason for the name change is unknown . the semi-historical malay annals state that temasek wa christened singapura by sang nila utama , a 13th-century srivijayan raja from palembang . malay annals state that sang nila utama encountered a strange beast on the island that he took to be a lion . seeing this a an omen , he established the town of singapura where he encountered the beast . the second hypothesis , drawn from tom pires # the suma oriental , postulate that this mythical story is based on the real life parameswara ( king ) of palembang . parameswara ( king ) declared independence from majapahit and mounted a lion throne , thus claiming the srivijaya empire . after then being driven into exile by the javanese people , he usurped control over temasek . it is possible that he rechristened the area a singapura , recalling the throne he had been driven from .
under japanese occupation , singapore wa renamed , meaning `` light of the south '' . singapore is sometimes referred to by the nickname the `` garden city '' , in reference to it park and tree-lined street . another name , the `` little red dot '' , wa adopted after an article publication in the the wall street journal asia of 4 august 1998 regarded the third indonesian president b. j. habibie by referring to singapore a a red dot on a map .

<section_title_start>  ancient singapore  <section_title_end>
in 1299 , according to the malay annals , the kingdom of singapura wa founded on the island by sang nila utama . although the historicity of the account a given in the malay annals is the subject of academic debate , it is nevertheless known from various document that singapore in the 14th century , then known a temasek , wa a trading port under the influence of both the majapahit empire and the ayutthaya kingdom kingdom , and wa a part of the indosphere . these indianised kingdom were characterised by surprising resilience , political integrity and administrative stability . historical source also indicate that around the end of the 14th century , it ruler parameswara ( king ) wa attacked by either the majapahit or the siamese , forcing him to move to malacca where he founded the sultanate of malacca . archaeological evidence suggests that the main settlement on fort canning wa abandoned around this time , although a small trading settlement continued in singapore for some time afterwards . in 1613 , portuguese people raider burned down the settlement , and the island faded into obscurity for the next two century . by then singapore wa nominally part of the johor sultanate . the wider maritime region and much trade wa under dutch control for the following period after the dutch conquest of malacca .
<section_title_start>  british colonisation  <section_title_end>
the british governor stamford raffle arrived in singapore on 28 january 1819 and soon recognised the island a a natural choice for the new port . the island wa then nominally ruled by abdul rahman muazzam shah of johor , the sultan of johor , who wa controlled by the dutch and the bugis . however , the sultanate wa weakened by factional division : the temenggong ( chief minister ) of tengku abdul rahman , a well a his official , were loyal to the sultan 's elder brother hussein shah of johor , who wa living in exile in riau island . with the temenggong 's help , raffle managed to smuggle tengku long back into singapore . raffle offered to recognise tengku long a the rightful sultan of johor , under the title of sultan hussein , a well a provide him with a yearly payment of $ 5000 and another $ 3000 to the temenggong ; in return , sultan hussein would grant the british the right to establish a trading post on singapore . a formal treaty wa signed on 6 february 1819.
in 1824 , a further treaty with the sultan led to the entire island becoming a british possession . in 1826 , singapore became part of the strait settlement , then under the jurisdiction of british india . singapore became the regional capital in 1836 . prior to raffle ' arrival , there were only about a thousand people living on the island , mostly indigenous malay along with a handful of chinese . by 1860 the population had swelled to over 80,000 , more than half being chinese . many of these early immigrant came to work on the pepper and uncaria gambir plantation . in 1867 , the strait settlement were separated from british india , coming under the direct control of britain . later , in the 1890s , when the rubber industry became established in singapore in malaysia and singapore , the island became a global centre for rubber sorting and export .
singapore wa not greatly affected by the first world war ( 191418 ) , a the conflict did not spread to southeast asia . the only significant event during the war wa the 1915 singapore mutiny by muslim sepoys from british india , who were garrisoned in singapore . after hearing rumour that they were to be sent to fight the ottoman empire , a muslim state , the soldier rebelled , killing their officer and several british civilian before the mutiny wa suppressed by non-muslim troop arriving from johore and burma .
after the first world war , the british built the large singapore naval base a part of the defensive singapore strategy . originally announced in 1921 , the construction of the base proceeded at a slow pace until the japanese invasion of manchuria in 1931 . costing $ 60 ; million and not fully completed in 1938 , it wa nonetheless the largest dry dock in the world , the third-largest floating dock ( jetty ) , and had enough fuel tank to support the entire british navy for six month . the base wa defended by heavy 15-inch naval gun stationed at fort siloso , fort canning and labrador , a well a a royal air force airfield at tengah air base . winston churchill touted it a the `` gibraltar of the east '' , and military discussion often referred to the base a simply `` east of suez '' . however , the british home fleet wa stationed in europe , and the british could not afford to build a second fleet to protect their interest in asia . the plan wa for the home fleet to sail quickly to singapore in the event of an emergency . a a consequence , after world war ii broke out in 1939 , the fleet wa fully occupied with defending britain , leaving singapore vulnerable to japanese invasion .
<section_title_start>  world war ii  <section_title_end>
during the pacific war , the japanese malayan campaign culminated in the battle of singapore . when the british force of 60,000 troop surrendered on 15 february 1942 , british prime minister winston churchill called the defeat `` the worst disaster and largest capitulation in british history . british and empire loss during the fighting for singapore were heavy , with a total of nearly 85,000 personnel captured . about 5,000 were killed or wounded , of which australian made up the majority . japanese casualty during the fighting in singapore amounted to 1,714 killed and 3,378 wounded . the occupation wa to become a major turning point in the history of several nation , including those of japan , britain , and singapore . japanese newspaper triumphantly declared the victory a deciding the general situation of the war . between 5,000 and 25,000 ethnic chinese people were killed in the subsequent sook ching massacre . british force had operation tiderace in 1945 ; however , the war ended before these operation could be carried out .
<section_title_start>  post-war period  <section_title_end>
after the surrender of japan to the ally on 15 august 1945 , singapore fell into a brief state of violence and disorder ; looting and revenge-killing were widespread . british , australian , and indian troop led by lord louis mountbatten operation tiderace to receive the formal surrender of japanese force in the region from general itagaki seishiro on behalf of general hisaichi terauchi on 12 september 1945 . meanwhile , tomoyuki yamashita wa tried by a u military commission for war crime , but not for crime committed by his troop in malaya or singapore . he wa convicted and hanged in the philippine on 23 february 1946.
much of singapore 's infrastructure had been destroyed during the war , including those needed to supply utility . a shortage of food led to malnutrition , disease , and rampant crime and violence . a series of strike in 1947 caused massive stoppage in public transport and other service . however , by late 1947 the economy began to recover , facilitated by a growing international demand for tin and rubber . the failure of britain to successfully defend it colony against the japanese changed it image in the eye of singaporean . british military administration ( malaya ) ended on 1 april 1946 , with singapore becoming a separate crown colony . in july 1947 , separate executive and legislative council were established and the election of six member of the legislative council wa scheduled in the following year .
during the 1950s , chinese communist with strong tie to the trade union and chinese school waged a guerrilla war against the government , leading to the malayan emergency . the 1954 national service riot , hock lee bus riot , and chinese middle school riot in singapore were all linked to these event . david marshall ( singaporean politician ) , pro-independence leader of the labour front , won singapore 's first general election in 1955 . he led a delegation to london , but britain rejected his demand for complete self-rule . he resigned and wa replaced by lim yew hock in 1956 , and after further negotiation britain to grant singapore full internal self-governance of singapore self-government for all matter except defence and foreign affair . during the subsequent 1959 singaporean general election , the people 's action party ( pap ) won a landslide victory . governor of singapore sir william allmond codrington goode served a the first yang di-pertuan negara ( head of state ) .
<section_title_start>  within malaysia  <section_title_end>
pap leader believed that singapore 's future lay with malaya , due to strong tie between the two . it wa thought that reuniting with malaya would benefit the economy by creating a common market , alleviating ongoing unemployment woe in singapore . however , a sizeable pro-communist wing of the pap wa strongly opposed to the merger , fearing a loss of influence , and hence formed the barisan sosialis , splitting from the pap . the ruling party of malaya , united malay national organisation ( umno ) , wa staunchly anti-communist , and it wa suspected umno would support the non-communist faction of pap . umno , initially sceptical of the idea of a merger due to distrust of the pap government and concern that the large ethnic chinese population in singapore would alter the racial balance in malaya on which their political power base depended , became supportive of the idea of the merger due to joint fear of a communist takeover .
on 27 may 1961 , malaya 's prime minister , tunku abdul rahman , made a surprise proposal for a new federation called malaysia , which would unite the current and former british possession in the region : the federation of malaya , singapore , brunei , north borneo ( british crown colony ) , and sarawak ( british crown colony ) . umno leader believed that the additional malay population in the bornean territory would balance singapore 's chinese population . the british government , for it part , believed that the merger would prevent singapore from becoming a haven for communism . to obtain a mandate for a merger , the pap held a 1962 merger referendum of singapore . this referendum included a choice of different term for a merger with malaysia but had no option for avoiding merger altogether . on 16 september 1963 , singapore joined with malaya , the north borneo , and sarawak to form the new federation of malaysia under the term of the malaysia agreement . under this agreement , singapore had a relatively high level of autonomy compared to the other state of malaysia .
indonesia opposed the formation of malaysia due to it own claim over borneo and launched indonesiamalaysia confrontation ( confrontation in indonesian ) in response to the formation of malaysia . on 10 march 1965 , a bomb planted by indonesian saboteur on a mezzanine floor of macdonald house exploded , killing three people and injuring 33 others . it wa the deadliest of at least 42 bomb incident which occurred during the confrontation . two member of the indonesian marine corp , osman bin haji mohamed ali and harun bin said , were eventually convicted and executed for the crime . the explosion caused u $ 250,000 ( ) in damage to macdonald house .
even after the merger , the people 's action partyunited malay national organisation relation on many political and economic issue . despite an agreement to establish a common market , singapore continued to face restriction when trading with the rest of malaysia . in retaliation , singapore did not extend to sabah and sarawak the full extent of the loan agreed to for economic development of the two eastern state . talk soon broke down , and abusive speech and writing became rife on both side . this led to communal strife in singapore , culminating in the 1964 race riot in singapore . on 7 august 1965 , malaysian prime minister tunku abdul rahman , seeing no alternative to avoid further bloodshed , advised the parliament of malaysia that it should vote to expel singapore from malaysia . on 9 august 1965 , member of the dewan rakyat , 2nd malaysian parliament voted 126 to 0 to move a bill to amend the constitution , expelling singapore from malaysia , which left singapore a a newly independent country .

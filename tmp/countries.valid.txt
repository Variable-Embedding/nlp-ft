Canada is a country in the northern part of North America . Its Provinces and territories of Canada extend from the Atlantic Ocean to the Pacific Ocean and northward into the Arctic Ocean , covering , making it the world 's List of countries and dependencies by area second-largest country by total area . Its southern and western CanadaUnited States border , stretching , is the world 's longest bi-national land border . Canada 's capital is Ottawa , and its three List of census metropolitan areas and agglomerations in Canada are Toronto , Montreal , and Vancouver .
Various Indigenous peoples in Canada for thousands of years before European colonization . Beginning in the 16th century , British colonization of the Americas and French colonization of the Americas expeditions explored and later settled along the Atlantic coast . As a consequence of Military history of Canada , France ceded nearly all of New France in 1763 . In 1867 , with the union of three British North American colonies through Canadian Confederation , Canada was formed as a Federalism dominion of four provinces . This began an Territorial evolution of Canada and a process of increasing autonomy from the United Kingdom . This widening autonomy was highlighted by the Statute of Westminster 1931 and culminated in the Canada Act 1982 , which severed the vestiges of legal dependence on the Parliament of the United Kingdom .
Canada is a parliamentary democracy and a constitutional monarchy in the Westminster system , with a Monarchy of Canada as [ of state ] and a Prime Minister of Canada who serves as the chair of the Cabinet of Canada and Government of Canada . The country is a Commonwealth realm and is Official bilingualism in Canada at the federal level . It International rankings of Canada in international measurements of government transparency , civil liberties , quality of life , economic freedom , and education . It is one of the world 's most ethnically diverse and Multiculturalism in Canada nations , the product of Immigration to Canada large-scale immigration from many other countries . Canada 's CanadaUnited States relations has had a significant impact on Economy of Canada and Culture of Canada .
As a highly developed country , Canada has the List of countries by GDP ( nominal ) per capita seventeenth-highest nominal per-capita income globally as well as the List of countries by Human Development Index thirteenth-highest ranking in the Human Development Index . Its advanced economy is the List of countries by GDP ( nominal ) tenth-largest in the world , relying chiefly upon its abundant natural resources and well-developed international trade networks . Canada is part of several major international and intergovernmental institutions or groupings including the United Nations , NATO , the Group of Seven , the Group of Ten ( economics ) , the G20 , the United StatesMexicoCanada Agreement , the Commonwealth of Nations , the Organisation internationale de la Francophonie , and the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation forum .
==Etymology==
While a variety of theories have been postulated for the etymological origins of Canada , the name is now accepted as coming from the St. Lawrence Iroquoians St. Lawrence Iroquoian word kanata , meaning `` village '' or `` settlement '' . In 1535 , Indigenous inhabitants of the present-day Quebec City region used the word to direct French explorer Jacques Cartier to the village of Stadacona . Cartier later used the word Canada to refer not only to that particular village but to the entire area subject to Donnacona ( the chief at Stadacona ) ; by 1545 , European books and maps had begun referring to this small region along the Saint Lawrence River as Canada .
From the 16th to the early 18th century `` Canada ( New France ) '' referred to the part of New France that lay along the Saint Lawrence River . In 1791 , the area became two British colonies called Upper Canada and Lower Canada collectively named the Canadas ; until their union as the British Province of Canada in 1841 . Upon Confederation in 1867 , Canada was adopted as the legal name for the new country at the London Conference of 1866 , and the word Dominion was conferred as the country 's title . By the 1950s , the term Dominion of Canada was no longer used by the United Kingdom , which considered Canada a `` Realm of the Commonwealth '' . The government of Louis St. Laurent ended the practice of using Dominion in the statutes of Canada in 1951.
In 1982 , the passage of the Canada Act , bringing the Constitution of Canada fully under Canadian control , referred only to Canada , while later that year the name of the national holiday was Canada Day # History . The term Dominion was used to distinguish the federal government from the provinces , though after the Military history of Canada during World War II the term federal had replaced dominion .
==History==
===Indigenous peoples===
Indigenous peoples in Canada Indigenous peoples in present-day Canada include the First Nations , Inuit , and Mtis people ( Canada ) , the last being a mixed-blood people who originated in the mid-17th century when First Nations people married European settlers and subsequently developed their own identity .
The Prehistoric migration and settlement of the Americas from Asia are generally hypothesized to have migrated from Siberia by way of the Beringia and arrived at least 14,000 years ago . The Paleo-Indian archeological sites at Old Crow Flats and Bluefish Caves are two of the oldest sites of human habitation in Canada . The Technological and industrial history of Canada # The Stone Age : Fire ( 14,000 BC  AD 1600 ) included permanent settlements , agriculture , complex societal hierarchies , and trading networks . Some of these cultures had collapsed by the time European explorers arrived in the late 15th and early 16th centuries and have only been discovered through archeological investigations .
The Population history of indigenous peoples of the Americas at the time of the first European settlements is estimated to have been between 200,000 and two million , with a figure of 500,000 accepted by Canada 's Royal Commission on Aboriginal Peoples . As a consequence of European colonization , the Indigenous population declined by forty to eighty percent , and several First Nations , such as the Beothuk , disappeared . The decline is attributed to several causes , including the Columbian Exchange , such as influenza , measles , and smallpox to which they had no natural immunity , conflicts over the fur trade , conflicts with the colonial authorities and settlers , and the loss of Indigenous lands to settlers and the subsequent collapse of several nations ' self-sufficiency .
Although not without conflict , Euro-Canadian ' early interactions with First Nations and Inuit populations were relatively peaceful . First Nations and Mtis peoples played a critical part in the development of Former colonies and territories in Canada , particularly for their role in assisting European coureur des bois and voyageurs in the exploration of the continent during the North American fur trade . The Canadian Crown and Aboriginal peoples began Timeline of colonization of North America during the European colonization period , though the Inuit , in general , had more limited interaction with European settlers . However , from the late 18th century , European Canadians encouraged Indigenous peoples to assimilate into their own culture . These attempts reached a climax in the late 19th and early 20th centuries with Canadian Indian residential school system and High Arctic relocation . A period of redress is underway , which started with the appointment of the Truth and Reconciliation Commission of Canada by the Government of Canada in 2008.
===European colonization===
It is believed that the first European to explore the east coast of Canada was Vikings explorer Leif Erikson . In approximately 1000 AD , the Norse built a small encampment that only lasted a few years at L'Anse aux Meadows on the northern tip of Newfoundland . No further European exploration occurred until 1497 , when Italian seafarer John Cabot explored and claimed Canada 's Atlantic Canada in the name of King Henry VII of England . In 1534 , French explorer Jacques Cartier explored the Gulf of Saint Lawrence where , on July 24 , he planted a cross bearing the words `` Long Live the King of France '' and took possession of the territory New France in the name of Francis I of France . The early 16th century saw European mariners with navigational techniques pioneered by the Basque people and Portuguese discoveries establish seasonal whaling and fishing outposts along the Atlantic coast . In general , early settlements during the Age of Discovery appear to have been Population of Canada # Ephemeral European settlements short-lived due to a combination of the harsh climate , problems with navigating trade routes and competing outputs in Scandinavia .
In 1583 , Sir Humphrey Gilbert , by the royal prerogative of Elizabeth I of England , founded St. John 's , Newfoundland and Labrador St. John 's , Newfoundland , as the first North American English overseas possessions . In 1600 , the French established their first seasonal trading post at Tadoussac along the Saint Lawrence . French explorer Samuel de Champlain arrived in 1603 and established the first permanent year-round European settlements at Port Royal , Annapolis County , Nova Scotia ( in 1605 ) and Quebec City ( in 1608 ) . Among the French colonization of the Americas of New France , French Canadian extensively settled the Saint Lawrence River valley and Acadians settled the present-day The Maritimes , while fur traders and Catholic Church and the Age of Discovery explored the Great Lakes , Hudson Bay , and the Mississippi watershed to Louisiana ( New France ) . The Beaver Wars broke out in the mid-17th century over control of the North American fur trade .
The English established additional settlements in Newfoundland ( island ) , beginning in 1610 and the Thirteen Colonies to the south were founded soon after . A series of French and Indian Wars erupted in colonial North America between 1689 and 1763 ; the later wars of the period constituted the North American theatre of the Seven Years ' War . Mainland Nova Scotia came under British rule with the 1713 Treaty of Utrecht , and Canada and most of New France came under British rule in 1763 after the Seven Years ' War .
===British North America===
The Royal Proclamation of 1763 established First Nation treaty rights , created the Province of Quebec ( 17631791 ) out of New France , and annexed Cape Breton Island to Nova Scotia . St. John 's Island ( now Prince Edward Island ) became a separate colony in 1769 . To avert conflict in Quebec , the British Parliament passed the Quebec Act , expanding Quebec 's territory to the Great Lakes and Ohio River . More importantly , the Quebec Act afforded Quebec special autonomy and rights of self-administration at a time when the Thirteen Colonies were increasingly agitating against British rule . It re-established the French language in Canada , Catholicism in Canada , and Law of France there , staving off the growth of an independence movement in contrast to the Thirteen Colonies . The Proclamation and the Quebec Act in turn angered many residents of the Thirteen Colonies , further fuelling anti-British sentiment in the years prior to the American Revolution .
After the successful American War of Independence , the Treaty of Paris ( 1783 ) recognized the independence of the newly formed United States and set the terms of peace , ceding British North American territories south of the Great Lakes and east of the Mississippi River to the new country . The American war of independence also caused a large out-migration of Loyalists , the settlers who had fought against American independence . Many moved to Canada , particularly Atlantic Canada , where their arrival changed the demographic distribution of the existing territories . New Brunswick was in turn split from Nova Scotia as part of a reorganization of Loyalist settlements in the Maritimes which led to the incorporation of Saint John , New Brunswick to become Canada 's first city . To accommodate the influx of English-speaking Loyalists in Central Canada , the Constitutional Act 1791 of 1791 divided the province of Canada into French-speaking Lower Canada ( later Quebec # Canadian Confederation ) and English-speaking Upper Canada ( later Ontario # Canada West ) , granting each its own elected legislative assembly .
The Canadas were the main front in the War of 1812 between the United States and the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland . Peace came in 1815 ; no boundaries were changed . Immigration resumed at a higher level , with over 960,000 arrivals from Britain between 1815 and 1850 . New arrivals included refugees escaping the Great Irish Famine as well as Scottish Gaelic-speaking Scots displaced by the Highland Clearances . Infectious diseases killed between 25 and 33 percent of Europeans who immigrated to Canada before 1891.
The desire for responsible government resulted in the abortive Rebellions of 1837 . The Report on the Affairs of British North America subsequently recommended responsible government and the assimilation of French Canadians into English culture . The Act of Union 1840 merged the Canadas into a united Province of Canada and responsible government was established for all provinces of British North America by 1849 . The signing of the Oregon Treaty by Britain and Mexican Cession ended the Oregon boundary dispute , extending the border westward along the 49th parallel north . This paved the way for British colonies on Colony of Vancouver Island Vancouver Island ( 1849 ) and in Colony of British Columbia ( 18581866 ) British Columbia ( 1858 ) . The Alaska Purchase of 1867 by the United States established the border along the Pacific coast , although there would continue to be some disputes about the exact demarcation of the AlaskaYukon and AlaskaBC border for years to come .
===Confederation and expansion===
Following several constitutional conferences , the Constitution Act , 1867 officially proclaimed Canadian Confederation on July 1 , 1867 , initially with four provinces : Ontario , Quebec , Nova Scotia , and New Brunswick . Canada assumed control of Rupert 's Land and the North-Western Territory to form the Northwest Territories , where the Mtis ' grievances ignited the Red River Rebellion and the creation of the province of Manitoba in July 1870 . British Columbia and Vancouver Island ( which United Colonies of Vancouver Island and British Columbia in 1866 ) joined the confederation in 1871 , while Prince Edward Island joined in 1873 . In 1898 , during the Klondike Gold Rush in the Northwest Territories , parliament created the Yukon Territory . Alberta and Saskatchewan became provinces in 1905 . Between 1871 and 1896 , almost one quarter of the Canadian population emigrated southwards , to the U.S.
To open Western Canada and encourage European immigration , Parliament approved sponsoring the construction of three transcontinental railways ( including the Canadian Pacific Railway ) , opening the prairies to settlement with the Dominion Lands Act , and establishing the North-West Mounted Police to assert its authority over this territory . This Post-Confederation Canada ( 18671914 ) # Expansion and National Policy resulted in the displacement of many Plains Indians to `` Indian reserves '' , clearing the way for ethnic European block settlements . This caused the collapse of the History of bison conservation in Canada # Plains bison and the introduction of European Agriculture in Canada dominating the land . The Indigenous peoples saw widespread famine and disease due to the loss of the bison and their traditional hunting lands The federal government did provide emergency relief , on condition of the Indigenous peoples moving to the reserves . During this time , Canada introduced the Indian Act extending its control over the First Nations to education , government and legal rights .
===Early 20th century===
Because Britain still maintained control of Canada 's foreign affairs under the British North America Act , 1867 , its declaration of war in 1914 automatically brought Military history of Canada during World War I . Volunteers sent to the Western Front ( World War I ) later became part of the Canadian Corps , which played a substantial role in the Battle of Vimy Ridge and other major engagements of the war . Out of approximately 625,000 Canadians who served in World War I , some 60,000 were killed and another 172,000 were wounded . The Conscription Crisis of 1917 erupted when the Unionist Party ( Canada ) Cabinet 's proposal to augment the military 's dwindling number of active members with conscription was met with vehement objections from French-speaking Quebecers . The Military Service Act brought in compulsory military service , though it , coupled with disputes over French language schools outside Quebec , deeply alienated Francophone Canadians and temporarily split the Liberal Party . In 1919 , Canada joined the League of Nations independently of Britain , and the Statute of Westminster 1931 affirmed Canada 's independence .
The Great Depression in Canada during the early 1930s saw an economic downturn , leading to hardship across the country . In response to the downturn , the Co-operative Commonwealth Federation ( CCF ) in Saskatchewan introduced many elements of a welfare state ( as pioneered by Tommy Douglas ) in the 1940s and 1950s . On the advice of Prime Minister William Lyon Mackenzie King , Declaration of war by Canada # Nazi Germany effective September 10 , 1939 , by King George VI , seven days after the United Kingdom . The delay underscored Canada 's independence .
The first Canadian Army units arrived in Britain in December 1939 . In all , over a million Canadians served in the armed forces during World War II and approximately 42,000 were killed and another 55,000 were wounded . Canadian troops played important roles in many key battles of the war , including the failed 1942 Dieppe Raid , the Allied invasion of Italy , the Normandy landings , the Operation Overlord , and the Battle of the Scheldt in 1944 . Canada provided asylum for the Dutch monarchy while that country was Reichskommissariat Niederlande and is credited by the Netherlands for major contributions to Liberation Day ( Netherlands ) from Nazi Germany .
The Canadian economy boomed during the war as its industries manufactured military materiel for Canada , Britain , Republic of China ( 191249 ) , and the Soviet Union . Despite another Conscription Crisis of 1944 in Quebec in 1944 , Canada finished the war with a large army and strong economy .
===Contemporary era===
The financial crisis of the Great Depression had led the Dominion of Newfoundland to relinquish responsible government in 1934 and become a crown colony ruled by a British governor . After two 1948 Newfoundland referendums , Newfoundlanders voted to join Canada in 1949 as a province .
Canada 's post-war economic growth , combined with the policies of successive Liberal governments , led to the emergence of a new Canadian identity , marked by the adoption of the Flag of Canada in 1965 , the implementation of official bilingualism ( English and French ) in 1969 , and the institution of Multiculturalism # Canada in 1971 . Social democracy programs were also instituted , such as Medicare ( Canada ) , the Canada Pension Plan , and Student loans in Canada , though provincial governments , particularly Quebec and Alberta , opposed many of these as incursions into their jurisdictions .
Finally , another series of constitutional conferences resulted in the UK 's Canada Act 1982 , the patriation of Canada 's constitution from the United Kingdom , concurrent with the creation of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms . Canada had established complete sovereignty as an independent country , although the Queen retained her role as monarch of Canada . In 1999 , Nunavut became Canada 's third territory after a series of negotiations with the federal government .
At the same time , Quebec underwent profound social and economic changes through the Quiet Revolution of the 1960s , giving birth to a secular Quebec nationalism movement . The radical Front de libration du Qubec ( FLQ ) ignited the October Crisis with a series of bombings and kidnappings in 1970 and the Quebec sovereignty movement Parti Qubcois was elected in 1976 , organizing an 1980 Quebec referendum on sovereignty-association in 1980 . Attempts to accommodate Quebec nationalism constitutionally through the Meech Lake Accord failed in 1990 . This led to the formation of the Bloc Qubcois in Quebec and the invigoration of the Reform Party of Canada in the West . A 1995 Quebec referendum followed in 1995 , in which sovereignty was rejected by a slimmer margin of 50.6 to 49.4 percent . In 1997 , the Supreme Court of Canada ruled Reference re Secession of Quebec by a province would be unconstitutional and the Clarity Act was passed by parliament , outlining the terms of a negotiated departure from Confederation .
In addition to the issues of Quebec sovereignty , a number of crises shook Canadian society in the late 1980s and early 1990s . These included the explosion of Air India Flight 182 in 1985 , the largest mass murder in Canadian history ; the cole Polytechnique massacre in 1989 , a school shooting targeting female students ; and the Oka Crisis of 1990 , the first of a number of violent confrontations between the government and Indigenous groups . Canada also joined the Gulf War in 1990 as part of a United Statesled coalition force and was active in several peacekeeping missions in the 1990s , including the UNPROFOR mission in the Yugoslav wars .
Canada sent Canada in the War in Afghanistan , but declined to join the United Statesled 2003 Invasion of Iraq . In 2011 , Canadian forces participated in the NATO-led intervention into the Libyan Civil War ( 2011 ) , and also became involved in battling the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant insurgency in Iraq in the mid-2010s . The COVID-19 pandemic in Canada began on January 27 , 2020 with wide social and economic disruption .
==Geography==
By total area ( including its waters ) , Canada is the List of countries and outlying territories by total area second-largest country in the world , after Russia . By land area alone , however , Canada List of countries and outlying territories by land area , due to having the world 's largest proportion of List of lakes of Canada . Stretching from the Atlantic Ocean in the east , along the Arctic Ocean to the north , and to the Pacific Ocean in the west , the country encompasses of territory . Canada also has vast maritime terrain , with the world 's longest coastline of . In addition to sharing the CanadaUnited States border world 's largest land border with the United Statesspanning Canada shares a maritime boundary with Greenland to the northeast and with the France 's overseas collectivity of Saint Pierre and Miquelon to the southeast . Canada is also home to the world 's northernmost settlement , CFS Alert , on the northern tip of Ellesmere Islandlatitude 82.5Nwhich lies from the North Pole .
The Geography of Canada # Physical geography is widely varied . Taiga prevail throughout the country , ice is prominent in Northern Canada and through the Rocky Mountains , and the relatively flat Canadian Prairies in the southwest facilitate Agriculture in Canada . The Great Lakes feed the St. Lawrence River ( in the southeast ) where the lowlands host much of Canada 's economic output . Canada has over 2,000,000 lakes563 of which are greater than containing much of the world 's fresh water . There are also fresh-water glaciers in the Canadian Rockies , the Coast Mountains and the Arctic Cordillera . Geology of Canada active , having List of earthquakes in Canada and Volcanism of Canada , notably Mount Meager massif , Mount Garibaldi , Mount Cayley massif , and the Mount Edziza volcanic complex .
===Biodiversity===
Canada is divided into Ecozones of Canada . These ecozones encompass over 80,000 classified species of Wildlife of Canada , with an equal number yet to be formally recognized or discovered . Due to human activities , invasive species and Environmental issues in Canada , there are currently more than List of Wildlife Species at Risk ( Canada ) .
Over half of Canada 's landscape is intact and relatively free of human development . The boreal forest of Canada is considered to be the largest intact forest landscape on Earth , with approximately undisturbed by roads , cities or industry . Since the end of the last glacial period , Canada has consisted of Forests of Canada # Regions , with 42 percent of its land area covered by forests ( approximately 8 percent of the world 's forested land ) .
Approximately 12.1 percent of the nation 's landmass and freshwater are National Wildlife Area , including 11.4 percent designated as Protected areas of Canada . Approximately 13.8 percent of its territorial waters are conserved , including 8.9 percent designated as protected areas . Canada 's first National Parks of Canada , Banff National Park established in 1885 , spans of mountainous terrain , with many glaciers and ice fields , dense pinophyta forest , and alpine landscapes . Canada 's oldest provincial park , Algonquin Provincial Park established in 1893 , covers an area of is dominated by old-growth forest with over 2,400 lakes and 1,200 kilometers of streams and rivers . Lake Superior National Marine Conservation Area is the world 's largest freshwater protected area spanning roughly of lakebed , its overlaying freshwater , and associated shoreline on of islands and mainland 's . Canada 's largest national wildlife region is the Scott Islands Marine National Wildlife Area , which spans , protects critical breeding and nesting habitat for over 40 percent of British Columbia 's seabirds .
===Climate===
Average winter and summer high Temperature in Canada vary from region to region . Winters can be harsh in many parts of the country , particularly in the interior and Prairie provinces , which experience a continental climate , where daily average temperatures are near , but can drop below with severe wind chills . In non-coastal regions , snow can cover the ground for almost six months of the year , while in parts of the north snow can persist year-round . Coastal British Columbia has a temperate climate , with a mild and rainy winter . On the east and west coasts , average high temperatures are generally in the low 20s C ( 70s F ) , while between the coasts , the average summer high temperature ranges from , with temperatures in some interior locations occasionally exceeding .
Much of Northern Canada is covered by ice and permafrost ; however , the future of the permafrost is uncertain because the Arctic has been warming at three times the global average as a result of climate change in Canada . Canada 's annual average temperature over land has warmed by , with changes ranging from in various regions , since 1948 . The rate of warming has been higher across the North and in the Prairies . In the southern regions of Canada , Air pollution in Canada from both Canada and the United Statescaused by metal smelting , burning coal to power utilities , and vehicle emissionshas resulted in acid rain , which has severely impacted waterways , forest growth and agricultural productivity in Canada .
==Government and politics==
Canada is described as a `` Democracy Index # Classification definitions '' , with a tradition of liberalism , and an egalitarian , moderate political ideology . An emphasis on social justice has been a distinguishing element of Canada 's political culture . Peace , order , and good government , alongside an implied bill of rights are founding principles of the Canadian government .
At the federal level , Canada has been dominated by two relatively centrist parties practicing `` brokerage politics '' , the centre-left leaning Liberal Party of Canada and the centre-right leaning Conservative Party of Canada ( or its Conservative Party of Canada # Predecessors ) . The historically predominant Liberal Party position themselves at the centre of the Canadian political spectrum , with the Conservative Party positioned on the right and the New Democratic Party occupying the left-wing . Far-right and far-left politics have never been a prominent force in Canadian society . Five parties had representatives elected to the federal parliament in the 2019 Canadian federal electionthe Liberal Party , who currently form a minority government ; the Conservative Party , who are the Official Opposition ( Canada ) ; the New Democratic Party ; the Bloc Qubcois ; and the Green Party of Canada .
Canada has a parliamentary system within the context of a constitutional monarchythe monarchy of Canada being the foundation of the executive , legislative , and judicial branches . The reigning monarch is Queen Elizabeth II , who is also monarch of 15 other Commonwealth countries and each of Canada 's 10 provinces . The person who is the Canadian monarch is the same as the British monarch , although the two institutions are separate . The monarch appoints a representative , the Governor General of Canada , to carry out most of her federal royal duties in Canada .
While the monarchy is theoretically the source of authority in Canada , in practice its position is mainly symbolic . In practice , the use of the executive powers is directed by the Cabinet of Canada , a committee of Minister of the Crown responsible to the elected House of Commons of Canada and chosen and headed by the Prime Minister of Canada ( at present Justin Trudeau ) , the [ of government ] . The governor general or monarch may , though , in certain crisis situations exercise their power without ministerial advice ( constitutional ) . To ensure the stability of government , the governor general will usually appoint as prime minister the individual who is the current leader of the political party that can obtain the confidence of a plurality ( voting ) in the House of Commons . The Office of the Prime Minister ( Canada ) Prime Minister 's Office ( PMO ) is thus one of the most powerful institutions in government , initiating most legislation for parliamentary approval and selecting for appointment by the Crown , besides the aforementioned , the governor general , Lieutenant governor ( Canada ) , senators , federal court judges , and heads of Crown corporations of Canada and government agencies . The leader of the party with the second-most seats usually becomes the Leader of the Official Opposition ( Canada ) leader of Her Majesty 's Loyal Opposition and is part of an adversarial parliamentary system intended to keep the government in check .
Each of the 338 members of parliament in the House of Commons is elected by simple plurality in an Canadian electoral district or riding . Elections in Canada must be called by the governor general , either on the advice of the prime minister or if the government loses a confidence vote in the House . Constitutionally , an election may be held no more than five years after the preceding election , although the Canada Elections Act limits this to four years with a fixed election date in October . The 105 members of the Senate , whose seats are apportioned on a regional basis , serve until age 75.
Canada 's federal structure divides government responsibilities between the federal government and the ten provinces . Legislative assemblies of Canadian provinces and territories are unicameral and operate in parliamentary fashion similar to the House of Commons . Canada 's three territories also have legislatures , but these are not sovereign and have fewer constitutional responsibilities than the provinces . The territorial legislatures also differ structurally from their provincial counterparts .
The Bank of Canada is the central bank of the country . In addition , the Minister of Finance ( Canada ) and Minister of Industry ( Canada ) utilize the Statistics Canada agency for financial planning and economic policy development . The Bank of Canada is the sole authority authorized to issue currency in the form of Banknotes of the Canadian dollar . The bank does not issue Coins of the Canadian dollar ; they are issued by the Royal Canadian Mint .
===Law===
The Constitution of Canada is the supreme law of the country , and consists of written text and unwritten conventions . The Constitution Act , 1867 ( known as the British North America Acts prior to 1982 ) , affirmed governance based on parliamentary precedent and divided powers between the federal and provincial governments . The Statute of Westminster 1931 granted full autonomy and the Constitution Act , 1982 , ended all legislative ties to Britain , as well as adding a constitutional amending formula and the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms . The Charter guarantees basic rights and freedoms that usually can not be over-ridden by any governmentthough a Section Thirty-three of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms allows the federal parliament and provincial legislatures to override certain sections of the Charter for a period of five years .
Court system of Canada Canada 's judiciary plays an important role in interpreting laws and has the power to strike down Acts of Parliament that violate the constitution . The Supreme Court of Canada is the highest court and final arbiter and has been led since December 18 , 2017 by Chief Justice Richard Wagner ( judge ) . Its nine members are appointed by the governor general on the advice of the prime minister and minister of justice . All judges at the superior and appellate levels are appointed after consultation with non-governmental legal bodies . The federal Cabinet also appoints justices to superior courts in the provincial and territorial jurisdictions .
Common law prevails everywhere except in Quebec , where civil law ( legal system ) predominates . Criminal law of Canada is solely a federal responsibility and is uniform throughout Canada . Law enforcement , including criminal courts , is officially a provincial responsibility , conducted by provincial and municipal police forces . However , in most rural areas and some urban areas , policing responsibilities are contracted to the federal Royal Canadian Mounted Police .
Canadian Aboriginal law provides certain Aboriginal land title in Canada and traditional practices for Indigenous groups in Canada . Various treaties and case laws were established to mediate relations between Europeans and many Indigenous peoples . Most notably , a series of eleven treaties known as the Numbered Treaties were signed between the Indigenous peoples and the reigning monarch of Canada between 1871 and 1921 . These treaties are agreements between the Canadian Queen-in-Council Crown-in-Council with the duty to consult and accommodate . The role of Aboriginal law and the rights they support were reaffirmed by Section 35 of the Constitution Act , 1982 Section 35 of the Constitution Act , 1982 . These rights may include provision of services , such as health care through the Indian Health Transfer Policy , and exemption from taxation .
===Foreign relations and military===
Canada is recognized as a middle power for its role in international affairs with a tendency to pursue multilateralism solutions . Canada 's foreign policy based on international peacekeeping and security is carried out through coalitions and international organizations , and through the work of numerous federal institutions . Canadian peacekeeping Canada 's peacekeeping role during the 20th century has played a major role in its global image . The strategy of the Foreign relations of Canada # Foreign aid Canadian government 's foreign aid policy reflects an emphasis to meet the Millennium Development Goals , while also providing assistance in response to foreign humanitarian crises .
Canada was a founding member of the United Nations and has membership in the World Trade Organization , the G20 and the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development ( OECD ) . Canada is also a member of various other international and regional organizations and forums for economic and cultural affairs . Canada acceded to the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights in 1976 . Canada joined the Organization of American States ( OAS ) in 1990 and hosted the OAS General Assembly in 2000 and the 3rd Summit of the Americas in 2001 . Canada seeks to expand its ties to Pacific Rim economies through membership in the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation forum ( APEC ) .
CanadaUnited States relations share the world 's longest undefended border , co-operate on military campaigns and exercises , and are each other 's CanadaUnited States trade relations . Canada nevertheless has an independent foreign policy , most notably maintaining full CanadaCuba relations , and declining to officially participate in the 2003 invasion of Iraq . Canada also maintains historic ties to the CanadaUnited Kingdom relations and CanadaFrance relations and to other former British and French colonies through Canada 's membership in the Commonwealth of Nations and the Organisation internationale de la Francophonie . Canada is noted for having a positive CanadaNetherlands relations , owing , in part , to its contribution to the Netherlands in World War II # Liberation .
Canada 's strong attachment to the British Empire and Commonwealth led to major participation in British military efforts in the Second Boer War , World War I and World War II . Since then , Canada has been an advocate for multilateralism , making efforts to resolve global issues in collaboration with other nations . During the Canada in the Cold War , Canada was a major contributor to UN forces in the Korean War and founded the North American Aerospace Defense Command ( NORAD ) in cooperation with the United States to defend against potential aerial attacks from the Soviet Union .
During the Suez Crisis of 1956 , future Prime Minister Lester B. Pearson eased tensions by proposing the inception of the United Nations peacekeeping , for which he was awarded the 1957 Nobel Peace Prize .

Persistent socioeconomic inequality and civil unrest culminated in the devastating Salvadoran Civil War from 1979 to 1992 , fought between the military-led government and a coalition of left-wing Guerrilla warfare groups . The conflict ended with the Chapultepec Peace Accords . This negotiated settlement established a multiparty constitutional republic , which remains in place to this day .
While this Civil War was going on in the country large numbers of Salvadorans immigrated to the United States , resulting in an immigrant population comparable to that of China 's . Although China 's territory is 500 times larger and the population is 200 times larger , by 2008 there were nearly as many Salvadoran immigrants to the United States as Chinese immigrants to the United States .
El Salvador 's economy has historically been dominated by agriculture , beginning with the Spanish taking control of the indigenous cacao crop in the 16th century , with production centered in Izalco , and the use of balsam from the ranges of La Libertad Department ( El Salvador ) and Ahuachapn Department . This was followed by a boom in use of the Indigofera ( ail in Spanish ) in the 19th century , mainly for its use as a dye . Thereafter the focus shifted to coffee , which by the early 20th century accounted for 90 % of export earnings . El Salvador has since reduced its dependence on coffee and embarked on diversifying its economy by opening up trade and financial links and expanding the manufacturing sector . The Salvadoran coln , the currency of El Salvador since 1892 , was replaced by the United States dollar in 2001 , by Francisco Flores .
El Salvador ranks 14th among Latin American countries in terms of the Human Development Index and third in Central America ( behind Panama and Costa Rica ) partly because of ongoing rapid industrialization . However , the country continues to struggle with high rates of poverty , inequality , and gang-related violent crime .
== Etymology ==
Conquistador Pedro de Alvarado named the new province after Jesus Christ  San Salvador ( lit . `` Saint Savior '' ) . The territory 's name , including the province of San Miguel , El Salvador , was later extended to the Provincia De Nuestro Seor Jesus Cristo , El Salvador Del Mundo ( ) , shortened to the Republic of El Salvador , or Salvador , during the post-Federal Republic period and subsequently settled on as El Salvador .
==History==
===Prehistoric===
Tomayate is a palaeontological site located on the banks of the river of the same name in the municipality of Apopa . The site has produced abundant Salvadoran megafauna fossils belonging to the Pleistocene . The palaeontological site was discovered accidentally in 2000 , and in the following year , an excavation by the Museum of Natural History of El Salvador revealed several remnants of Cuvieronius and 18 other species of vertebrates including giant tortoises , Megatherium , Glyptodon , Toxodon , extinct horses , paleo-llamas . The site stands out from most Central American Pleistocene deposits , being more ancient and much richer , which provides valuable information of the Great American Interchange , in which the Central American isthmus land bridge was paramount . At the same time , it is considered the richest vertebrate site in Central America and one of the largest accumulations of proboscideans in the Americas .
===Pre-Columbian===
Sophisticated civilization in El Salvador dates to its settlement by the indigenous Lenca people ; theirs was the first and the oldest indigenous civilization to settle in there . They were a union of Central American tribes that oversaw most of the isthmus from southern Guatemala to northern Panama , which they called Managuara . The Lenca of eastern El Salvador trace their origins to specific caves with ancient pictographs dating back to at least 600 AD and some sources say as far back as 7000 BC . There was also a presence of Olmecs , although their role is unclear . Their influence remains recorded in the form of stone monuments and artefacts preserved in western El Salvador , as well as the national museum . A Mayan population settled there in the Formative stage period , but their numbers were greatly diminished when the Lake Ilopango supervolcano eruption caused a massive exodus .
Centuries later the area 's occupants were displaced by the Pipil people , Nahuan languages speaking groups who migrated from Anahuac ( Aztec ) beginning around 800 AD and occupied the central and western regions of El Salvador . The Nahua Pipil were the last indigenous people to arrive in El Salvador . They called their territory Kuskatan , a Nawat language word meaning `` The Place of Precious Jewels , '' back-formation back-formed into Classical Nahuatl Czcatln , and Hispanicized as Cuzcatln . It was the largest domain in Salvadoran territory up until European contact . The term Cuzcatleco is commonly used to identify someone of Salvadoran heritage , although the majority of the eastern population has indigenous heritage of Lenca origin , as do their place names such as Intipuc , Chirilagua , and Lolotique .
Most of the archaeological sites in western El Salvador such as Lake Gija and Joya de Cern indicate a pre-Columbian Mayan culture . Cihuatn shows signs of material trade with northern Nahua culture , eastern Mayan and Lenca culture , and southern Nicaraguan and Costa Rican indigenous culture . Tazumal 's smaller B1-2 structure shows a Talud-tablero-Talud-tablero style of architecture that is associated with Nahua culture and corresponds with their migration history from Anahuac . In eastern El Salvador , the Lenca site of Quelepa is highlighted as a major pre-Columbian cultural center and demonstrates links to the Mayan site of Copn in western Honduras as well as the previously mentioned sites in Chalchuapa , and Cara Sucia ( Mesoamerican site ) in western El Salvador . An investigation of the site of La Laguna in Usulutn has also produced Copador items which link it to the Lenca-Maya trade route .
=== European arrival ( 1522 ) ===
By 1521 , the indigenous population of the Mesoamerican area had been drastically reduced by the History of smallpox that was spreading throughout the territory , although it had not yet reached pandemic levels in Cuzcatln or the northern portion Managuara . The first known visit by Spaniards to what is now Salvadoran territory was made by the admiral Andrs Nio , who led an expedition to Central America . He disembarked in the Gulf of Fonseca on 31 May 1522 , at Meanguera del Golfo , naming it Petronila , and then traversed to Jiquilisco Bay on the mouth of Lempa River . The first indigenous people to have contact with the Spanish were the Lenca of eastern El Salvador .
====Conquest of Cuzcatln and Managuara====
In 1524 , after participating in the Spanish conquest of the Aztec Empire , Pedro de Alvarado , his brother Gonzalo , and their men crossed the Paz River southward into Cuzcatlec territory . The Spaniards were disappointed to discover that the Pipil had no gold or jewels like those they had found in Guatemala or Mexico , but they recognized the richness of the land 's volcanic soil .
Pedro Alvarado led the first incursion to extend their dominion to the domain of Cuzcatlan in June 1524 . When he arrived at the borders of the kingdom , he saw that civilians had been evacuated . Cuzcatlec warriors moved to the coastal city of Acajutla and waited for Alvarado and his forces . Alvarado approached , confident that the result would be similar to what occurred in Mexico and Guatemala . He thought he would easily deal this new indigenous force since the Mexican allies on his side and the Pipil spoke a similar language .
Alvarado described the Cuzcatlec soldiers as having shields decorated with colourful exotic feathers , a vest-like armour made of three inch cotton which arrows could not penetrate , and long spears . Both armies suffered many casualties , with a wounded Alvarado retreating and losing a lot of his men , especially among the Mexican Indian auxiliaries . Once his army had regrouped , Alvarado decided to head to the Cuzcatlan capital and again faced armed Cuzcatlec . Wounded , unable to fight and hiding in the cliffs , Alvarado sent his Spanish men on their horses to approach the Cuzcatlec to see if they would fear the horses , but they did not retreat , Alvarado recalls in his letters to Hernn Corts .
The Cuzcatlec attacked again , and on this occasion stole Spanish weaponry . Alvarado retreated and sent Mexican messengers to demand that the Cuzcatlec warriors return the stolen weapons and surrender to their opponent 's king . The Cuzcatlec responded with the famous response , `` If you want your weapons , come get them '' . As days passed , Alvarado , fearing an ambush , sent more Mexican messengers to negotiate , but these messengers never came back and were presumably executed .
The Spanish efforts were firmly resisted by Pipil and their Mayan-speaking neighbours . They defeated the Spaniards and what was left of their Tlaxcalan allies , forcing them to withdraw to Guatemala . After being wounded , Alvarado abandoned the war and appointed his brother , Gonzalo de Alvarado , to continue the task . Two subsequent expeditions ( the first in 1525 , followed by a smaller group in 1528 ) brought the Pipil under Spanish control , since the Pipil also were weakened by a regional epidemic of smallpox . In 1525 , the conquest of Cuzcatln was completed and the city of San Salvador was established . The Spanish faced much resistance from the Pipil and were not able to reach eastern El Salvador , the area of the Lencas .
In 1526 the Spanish founded the garrison town of San Miguel , El Salvador in northern Managuaraterritory of the Lenca , headed by another explorer and conquistador , Luis de Moscoso Alvarado , nephew of Pedro Alvarado . Oral history holds that a Maya-Lenca crown princess , Antu Silan Ulap I , organized resistance to the conquistadors . The kingdom of the Lenca was alarmed by de Moscoso 's invasion , and Antu Silan travelled from village to village , uniting all the Lenca towns in present-day El Salvador and Honduras against the Spaniards . Through surprise attacks and overwhelming numbers , they were able to drive the Spanish out of San Miguel and destroy the garrison .
For ten years the Lencas prevented the Spanish from building a permanent settlement . Then the Spanish returned with more soldiers , including about 2,000 forced conscripts from indigenous communities in Guatemala . They pursued the Lenca leaders further up into the mountains of Intibuc Department .
Antu Silan Ulap eventually handed over control of the Lenca resistance to Lempira ( Lenca ruler ) ( also called Empira ) . Lempira was noteworthy among indigenous leaders in that he mocked the Spanish by wearing their clothes after capturing them and using their weapons captured in battle . Lempira fought in command of thousands of Lenca forces for six more years in Managuara until he was killed in battle . The remaining Lenca forces retreated into the hills . The Spanish were then able to rebuild their garrison town of San Miguel in 1537.
=== Colonial period ( 15251821 ) ===
During the colonial period , San Salvador and San Miguel were part of the Captaincy General of Guatemala , also known as the Kingdom of Guatemala ( Reino de Guatemala ) , created in 1609 as an administrative division of New Spain . The Salvadoran territory was administered by the Mayor of Sonsonate , with San Salvador being established as an Intendancy of San Salvador in 1786.
In 1811 , a combination of internal and external factors motivated Central American elites to attempt to gain independence from the Spanish Crown . The most important internal factors were the desire of local elites to control the country 's affairs free of involvement from Spanish authorities , and the long-standing Creole aspiration for independence . The main external factors motivating the independence movement were the success of the French Revolution and American Revolution revolutions in the 18th century , and the weakening of the Spanish Crown 's military power as a result of the Napoleonic Wars , with the resulting inability to control its colonies effectively .
In November 1811 Salvadoran priest Jos Matas Delgado rang the bells of Iglesia La Merced in San Salvador , calling for insurrection and launching the 1811 Independence Movement . This insurrection was suppressed , and many of its leaders were arrested and served sentences in jail . Another insurrection was launched in 1814 , which was also suppressed .
=== Independence ( 1821 ) ===
In 1821 in light of unrest in Guatemala , Spanish authorities capitulated and signed the Act of Independence of Central America , which released all of the Captaincy of Guatemala ( comprising current territories of Guatemala , El Salvador , Honduras , Nicaragua and Costa Rica and the Mexican state of Chiapas ) from Spanish rule and declared its independence . In 1821 , El Salvador joined Costa Rica , Guatemala , Honduras and Nicaragua in a union named the Federal Republic of Central America .
In early 1822 , the authorities of the newly independent Central American provinces , meeting in Guatemala City , voted to join the newly constituted First Mexican Empire under Agustn de Iturbide . El Salvador resisted , insisting on autonomy for the Central American countries . A Mexican military detachment marched to San Salvador and suppressed dissent , but with the fall of Iturbide on 19 March 1823 , the army decamped back to Mexico . Shortly thereafter , the authorities of the provinces revoked the vote to join Mexico , deciding instead to form a federal union of the five remaining provinces . ( Chiapas permanently joined Mexico at this juncture . ) When the Federal Republic of Central America dissolved in 1841 , El Salvador maintained its own government until it joined Honduras and Nicaragua in 1896 to form the Greater Republic of Central America , which dissolved in 1898.
After the mid-19th century , the economy was based on coffee growing . As the world market for indigo withered away , the economy prospered or suffered as the world coffee price fluctuated . The enormous profits that coffee yielded as a monoculture export served as an impetus for the concentration of land into the hands of an oligarchy of just a few families . Throughout the last half of the 19th century , a succession of presidents from the ranks of the Salvadoran oligarchy , nominally both conservative and liberal , generally agreed on the promotion of coffee as the predominant cash crop , the development of infrastructure ( railroads and port facilities ) primarily in support of the coffee trade , the elimination of communal landholdings to facilitate further coffee production , the passage of anti-vagrancy laws to ensure that displaced Peasant and other rural residents provided sufficient labour for the coffee fincas ( plantations ) , and the suppression of rural discontent . In 1912 , the national guard was created as a rural police force .
===20th century===
In 1898 , General Toms Regalado ( Salvadoran politician ) gained power by force , deposing Rafael Antonio Gutirrez and ruling as president until 1903 . Once in office he revived the practice of presidents designating their successors . After serving his term , he remained active in the Army of El Salvador and was killed 11 July 1906 , at El Jicaro during a Totoposte Wars . Until 1913 El Salvador was politically stable , with undercurrents of popular discontent . When President Manuel Enrique Araujo was killed in 1913 , many hypotheses were advanced for the political motive of his murder .
Araujo 's administration was followed by the Melendez-Quinonez dynasty that lasted from 1913 to 1927 . Po Romero Bosque , ex-Minister of the Government and a trusted collaborator of the dynasty , succeeded President Jorge Melndez and in 1930 announced free elections , in which Arturo Araujo came to power on 1 March 1931 in what was considered the country 's first freely contested election . His government lasted only nine months before it was overthrown by junior military officers who accused his Labor Party of lacking political and governmental experience and of using its government offices inefficiently . President Araujo faced general popular discontent , as the people had expected economic reforms and the redistribution of land . There were demonstrations in front of the National Palace from the first week of his administration . His vice president and minister of war was General Maximiliano Hernndez Martnez .
In December 1931 , a 1931 Salvadoran coup d'tat coup d'tat was organized by junior officers and led by Martnez . Only the First Regiment of Cavalry and the National Police defended the presidency ( the National Police had been on its payroll ) , but later that night , after hours of fighting , the badly outnumbered defenders surrendered to rebel forces . The Directorate , composed of officers , hid behind a shadowy figure , a rich anti-Communist banker called Rodolfo Duke , and later installed the ardent fascist Martnez as president . The revolt was probably caused by the army 's discontent at not having been paid by President Araujo for some months . Araujo left the National Palace and unsuccessfully tried to organize forces to defeat the revolt .
The U.S. Minister in El Salvador met with the Directorate and later recognized the government of Martnez , which agreed to hold presidential elections . He resigned six months prior to running for re-election , winning back the presidency as the only candidate on the ballot . He ruled from 1935 to 1939 , then from 1939 to 1943 . He began a fourth term in 1944 but resigned in May after a general strike . Martnez had said he was going to respect the constitution , which stipulated he could not be re-elected , but he refused to keep his promise .
==== La Matanza ====
From December 1931 , the year of the coup that brought Martnez to power , there was brutal suppression of rural resistance . The most notable event was the February La Matanza , originally led by Farabundo Mart and Abel Cuenca , and university students Alfonso Luna and Mario Zapata , but these leaders were captured before the planned insurrection . Only Cuenca survived ; the other insurgents were killed by the government . After the capture of the movement leaders , the insurrection erupted in a disorganized and mob-controlled fashion , resulting in government repression that was later referred to as La Matanza ( The Massacre ) , because tens of thousands of citizens died in the ensuing chaos on the orders of President Martinez .
In the unstable political climate of the previous few years , the social activist and revolutionary leader Farabundo Mart helped found the Communist Party of Central America , and led a Communist alternative to the Red Cross called International Red Aid , serving as one of its representatives . Their goal was to help poor and underprivileged Salvadorans through the use of MarxismLeninism Marxist-Leninist ideology ( strongly rejecting Stalinism ) . In December 1930 , at the height of the country 's economic and social depression , Mart was once again exiled because of his popularity among the nation 's poor and rumours of his upcoming nomination for president the following year . Once Arturo Araujo was elected president in 1931 , Mart returned to El Salvador , and along with Alfonso Luna and Mario Zapata began the movement that was later truncated by the military .
They helped start a guerrilla revolt of indigenous farmers . The government responded by killing over 30,000 people at what was to have been a `` peaceful meeting '' in 1932 . The peasant uprising against Martnez was crushed by the Salvadoran military ten days after it had begun . The Communist-led rebellion , fomented by collapsing coffee prices , enjoyed some initial success , but was soon drowned in a bloodbath . President Martnez , who had toppled an elected government only weeks earlier , ordered the defeated Mart shot after a perfunctory hearing .
Historically , the high Salvadoran population density has contributed to tensions with neighbouring Honduras , as land-poor Salvadorans emigrated to less densely populated Honduras and established themselves as squatters on unused or underused land . This phenomenon was a major cause of the Football War between the two countries . As many as 130,000 Salvadorans were forcibly expelled or fled from Honduras .
The Christian Democratic Party ( El Salvador ) ( PDC ) and the National Coalition Party ( El Salvador ) ( PCN ) were active in Salvadoran politics from 1960 until 2011 , when they were disbanded by the Supreme Court because they had failed to win enough votes in the 2004 presidential election ; Both parties have since reconstituted . They share common ideals , but one represents the middle class and the latter the interests of the Salvadoran military .
PDC leader Jos Napolen Duarte was the mayor of San Salvador from 1964 to 1970 , winning three elections during the regime of PCN President Julio Adalberto Rivera Carballo , who allowed free elections for mayors and the National Assembly . Duarte later ran for president with a political grouping called the National Opposition Union ( UNO ) but was defeated in the 1972 presidential elections . He lost to the ex-Minister of Interior , Col. Arturo Armando Molina , in an election that was widely viewed as fraudulent ; Molina was declared the winner even though Duarte was said to have received a majority of the votes . Duarte , at some army officers ' request , supported a revolt to protest the election fraud , but was captured , tortured and later exiled . Duarte returned to the country in 1979 to enter politics after working on projects in Venezuela as an engineer .
=== Salvadoran Civil War ( 19791992 ) ===
On 15 October 1979 , a 1979 Salvadoran coup d'tat coup d'tat brought the Revolutionary Government Junta of El Salvador to power . It nationalized many private companies and took over much privately owned land . The purpose of this new junta was to stop the revolutionary movement already underway in response to Duarte 's stolen election . Nevertheless , the oligarchy opposed agrarian reform , and a junta formed with young liberal elements from the army such as Adolfo Arnoldo Majano Gen. Majano and Jaime Abdul Gutirrez Gen. Gutierrez , as well as with progressives such as Guillermo Ungo and Alvarez .
Pressure from the oligarchy soon dissolved the junta because of its inability to control the army in its repression of the people fighting for unionization rights , agrarian reform , better wages , accessible health care and freedom of expression . In the meantime , the guerrilla movement was spreading to all sectors of Salvadoran society . Middle and high school students were organized in MERS ( Movimiento Estudiantil Revolucionario de Secundaria , Revolutionary Movement of Secondary Students ) ; college students were involved with AGEUS ( Asociacion de Estudiantes Universitarios Salvadorenos ; Association of Salvadoran College Students ) ; and workers were organized in BPR ( Bloque Popular Revolucionario , Popular Revolutionary Block ) . In October 1980 , several other major guerrilla groups of the Salvadoran left had formed the Farabundo Mart National Liberation Front , or FMLN . By the end of the 1970s , government-contracted death squads were killing about 10 people each day . Meanwhile , the FMLN had 6,000  8,000 active guerrillas and hundreds of thousands of part-time militia , supporters , and sympathizers .
The U.S. supported and financed the creation of a second junta to change the political environment and stop the spread of a leftist insurrection . Napolen Duarte was recalled from his exile in Venezuela to head this new junta . However , a revolution was already underway and his new role as head of the junta was seen by the general population as opportunistic . He was unable to influence the outcome of the insurrection . scar Romero , the Roman Catholic Archbishop of San Salvador , denounced injustices and massacres committed against civilians by government forces . He was considered `` the voice of the voiceless '' , but he was assassinated by a death squad while saying Mass on 24 March 1980 . Some consider this to be the beginning of the full Salvadoran Civil War , which lasted from 1980 to 1992 . An unknown number of people `` disappeared '' during the conflict , and the UN reports that more than 75,000 were killed . The Salvadoran Army 's US-trained Atlacatl Battalion was responsible for the El Mozote massacre where more than 800 civilians were murdered , over half of them children , the El Calabozo massacre , and the murder of UCA scholars .
On 16 January 1992 , the government of El Salvador , represented by president Alfredo Cristiani , and the FMLN , represented by the commanders of the five guerrilla groups  Shafik Handal , Joaqun Villalobos , Salvador Snchez Cern , Francisco Jovel and Fermn Cienfuegos , all signed peace agreements brokered by the United Nations ending the 12-year civil war . This event , held at Chapultepec Castle in Mexico , was attended by U.N. dignitaries and other representatives of the international community . After signing the armistice , the president stood up and shook hands with all the now ex-guerrilla commanders , an action which was widely admired .
=== Post-war ( 1992present ) ===
The so-called Chapultepec Peace Accords mandated reductions in the size of the army , and the dissolution of the National Police , the Treasury Police , the National Guard and the Civilian Defence , a paramilitary group . A new Civil Police was to be organized . Judicial immunity for crimes committed by the armed forces ended ; the government agreed to submit to the recommendations of a Commission on the Truth for El Salvador ( Comisin de la Verdad Para El Salvador ) , which would `` investigate serious acts of violence occurring since 1980 , and the nature and effects of the violence , and ... recommend methods of promoting national reconciliation '' . In 1993 the Commission delivered its findings reporting human rights violations on both sides of the conflict . Five days later the El Salvadoran legislature passed an amnesty law for all acts of violence during the period .
From 1989 until 2004 , Salvadorans favoured the Nationalist Republican Alliance ( ARENA ) party , voting in ARENA presidents in every election ( Alfredo Cristiani , Armando Caldern Sol , Francisco Flores Prez , Antonio Saca ) until 2009 . The unsuccessful attempts of the left-wing party to win presidential elections led to its selection of a journalist rather than a former guerrilla leader as a candidate . On 15 March 2009 , Mauricio Funes , a television figure , became the first president from the Farabundo Mart National Liberation Front ( FMLN ) party . He was inaugurated on 1 June 2009 . One focus of the Funes government has been revealing the alleged corruption from the past government .
ARENA formally expelled Saca from the party in December 2009 . With 12 loyalists in the National Assembly , Saca established his own party , GANA ( Gran Alianza por la Unidad Nacional or Grand Alliance for National Unity ) , and entered into a tactical legislative alliance with the FMLN . After three years in office , with Saca 's GANA party providing the FMLN with a legislative majority , Funes had not taken action to either investigate or to bring corrupt former officials to justice .
Economic reforms since the early 1990s brought major benefits in terms of improved social conditions , diversification of the export sector , and access to international financial markets at investment grade level . Crime remains a major problem for the investment climate.Early in the new millennium , El Salvador 's government created the Ministerio de Medio Ambiente y Recursos Naturales ;  the Ministry of Environment and Natural Resources ( MARN ) ;  in response to climate change concerns .
==Geography==
El Salvador lies in the isthmus of Central America between latitudes 13th parallel north 13 and 15th parallel north 15N , and longitudes 87th meridian west 87 and 91st meridian west 91W . It stretches from west-northwest to east-southeast and north to south , with a total area of . As the smallest country in continental America , El Salvador is affectionately called Pulgarcito de America ( the `` Tom Thumb of the Americas '' ) . El Salvador shares borders with Guatemala and Honduras , the total national boundary length is : with Guatemala and with Honduras . It is the only Central American country that has no Caribbean coastline . The coastline on the Pacific is long .
El Salvador has over 300 rivers , the most important of which is the Lempa River . Originating in Guatemala , the Rio Lempa cuts across the northern range of mountains , flows along much of the central plateau , and cuts through the southern volcanic range to empty into the Pacific . It is El Salvador 's only navigable river . It and its tributaries drain about half of the country 's area . Other rivers are generally short and drain the Pacific lowlands or flow from the central plateau through gaps in the southern mountain range to the Pacific . These include the Goascorn River , Jiboa River , Torola River , Paz River and the Ro Grande de San Miguel .
There are several lakes enclosed by volcanic craters in El Salvador , the most important of which are Lake Ilopango ( ) and Lake Coatepeque ( ) . Lake Gija is El Salvador 's largest natural lake ( ) . Several artificial lakes were created by the damming of the Lempa , the largest of which is Cerrn Grande Hydroelectric Dam ( ) . There are a total of water within El Salvador 's borders .
The highest point in El Salvador is Cerro El Pital , at , on the border with Honduras . Two parallel mountain ranges cross El Salvador to the west with a central plateau between them and a narrow coastal plain hugging the Pacific . These physical features divide the country into two physiographic regions . The mountain ranges and central plateau , covering 85 % of the land , comprise the interior highlands . The remaining coastal plains are referred to as the Pacific lowlands .
===Climate===
El Salvador has a tropical climate with pronounced wet and dry seasons . Temperatures vary primarily with elevation and show little seasonal change . The Pacific lowlands are uniformly hot ; the central plateau and mountain areas are more moderate . The rainy season extends from May to October ; this time of year is referred to as invierno or winter . Almost all the annual rainfall occurs during this period ; yearly totals , particularly on southern-facing mountain slopes , can be as high as 2170 ; mm . Protected areas and the central plateau receive less , although still significant , amounts . Rainfall during this season generally comes from low pressure systems formed over the Pacific and usually falls in heavy afternoon thunderstorms .
From November through April , the northeast trade winds control weather patterns ; this time of year is referred to as verano , or summer . During these months , air flowing from the Caribbean has lost most of its precipitation while passing over the mountains in Honduras . By the time this air reaches El Salvador , it is dry , hot , and hazy , and the country experiences hot weather , excluding the northern higher mountain ranges , where temperatures are generally cooler .
===Natural disasters===
====Extreme weather events====
El Salvador 's position on the Pacific Ocean also makes it subject to severe weather conditions , including heavy rainstorms and severe droughts , both of which may be made more extreme by the El Nio and La Nia effects . Hurricanes occasionally form in the Pacific with the notable exception of Hurricane Mitch , which formed in the Atlantic and crossed Central America .
In the summer of 2001 a severe drought destroyed 80 % of El Salvador 's crops , causing famine in the countryside . On 4 October 2005 , severe rains resulted in dangerous flooding and landslides , which caused at least 50 deaths .
====Earthquakes and volcanic activity====
El Salvador lies along the Pacific Ring of Fire and is thus subject to significant tectonic activity , including frequent earthquakes and volcano activity . The capital San Salvador was destroyed in 1756 and 1854 , and it suffered heavy damage in the 1919 , 1982 , and 1986 tremors . Recent examples include the earthquake on 13 January 2001 that measured 7.7 on the Richter magnitude scale and caused a landslide that killed more than 800 people ; and another earthquake only a month later , on 13 February 2001 , that killed 255 people and damaged about 20 % of the nation 's housing . A Moment magnitude scale 5.7 Mw earthquake in 1986 resulted in 1,500 deaths , 10,000 injuries , and 100,000 people left homeless .
El Salvador has over twenty volcanoes ; two of them , San Miguel and Izalco ( volcano ) , have been active in recent years . From the early 19th century to the mid-1950s , Izalco erupted with a regularity that earned it the name `` Lighthouse of the Pacific '' . Its brilliant flares were clearly visible for great distances at sea , and at night its glowing lava turned it into a brilliant luminous cone . The most recent destructive volcanic eruption took place on 1 October 2005 , when the Santa Ana Volcano spewed a cloud of ash , hot mud and rocks that fell on nearby villages and caused two deaths . The most severe volcanic eruption in this area occurred in the 5th century AD when the Lake Ilopango volcano erupted with a Volcanic Explosivity Index strength of 6 , producing widespread pyroclastic flows and devastating Maya civilization .
===Flora and fauna===
It is estimated that there are 500 species of birds , 1,000 species of butterflies , 400 species of orchids , 800 species of trees , and 800 species of marine fish in El Salvador .
There are eight species of sea turtles in the world ; six of them nest on the coasts of Central America , and four make their home on the Salvadoran coast : the Leatherback sea turtle , the Hawksbill sea turtle , the green sea turtle , and the olive ridley sea turtle . The hawksbill is critically endangered .
Recent conservation efforts provide hope for the future of the country 's biological diversity . In 1997 , the government established the Ministry of the Environment and Natural Resources . A general environmental framework law was approved by the National Assembly in 1999 . Several non-governmental organizations are doing work to safeguard some of the country 's most important forested areas . Foremost among these is SalvaNatura , which manages El Impossible , the country 's largest national park under an agreement with El Salvador 's environmental authorities .
El Salvador is home to six terrestrial ecosystems : Central American montane forests , Sierra Madre de Chiapas moist forests , Central American dry forests , Central American pine-oak forests , Gulf of Fonseca mangroves , and Northern Dry Pacific Coast mangroves . It had a 2018 Forest Landscape Integrity Index mean score of 4.05/10 , ranking it 136th globally out of 172 countries .
==Government and politics==
The 1983 constitution is the highest legal authority in the country . El Salvador has a democratic and representative government , whose three bodies are :
# The Executive Branch , headed by the President of the Republic , who is elected by direct vote and remains in office for five years with no re-election but he can be elected after sitting out one electoral period . The president has a Cabinet of Ministers whom he appoints , and is also the Commander-in-Chief of the Armed Forces .
# The Legislative Branch , called El Salvador 's Legislative Assembly ( unicameral ) , consisting of 84 deputies .
# The Judiciary , headed by the Supreme Court , which is composed of 15 judges , one of them being elected as President of the Judiciary .
The political framework of El Salvador is a presidential system representative democracy republic with a multiform , multi-party system . The President of El Salvador , currently Nayib Bukele , is both [ of state ] and [ of government ] . Executive ( government ) is exercised by the government . Legislature is vested in both the government and the Legislative Assembly of El Salvador . The country also has an independent judiciary and Supreme Court of El Salvador .
===Politics===
El Salvador has a multi-party system . Two political parties , the Nationalist Republican Alliance ( ARENA ) and the Farabundo Mart National Liberation Front ( FMLN ) have tended to dominate elections . ARENA candidates won four consecutive presidential elections until the election of Mauricio Funes of the FMLN in March 2009 . The FMLN Party is leftist in ideology , and is split between the dominant Marxist-Leninist faction in the legislature , and the Social liberalism wing led by President Funes . However , the two-party dominance was broken after Nayib Bukele , a candidate from GANA won the 2019 Salvadoran presidential election .
Geographically , Departments of El Salvador of the Central region , especially the capital and the coastal regions , known as departamentos rojos , or red departments , are relatively Leftist . The departamentos azules , or blue departments in the east , western and highland regions are relatively conservative . The winner of the Salvadoran presidential election , 2014 , Salvador Snchez Cern belongs to the FMLN party . In the 2015 elections for mayors and members of the National Assembly , ARENA appeared to be the winner with tight control of the National Assembly .
=== Foreign relations ===
El Salvador is a member of the United Nations and several of its specialized agencies , including the Organization of American States , the Central American Parliament , and the Central American Integration System . It actively participates in the Central American Security Commission , which seeks to promote regional arms control . El Salvador is a member of the World Trade Organization and is pursuing regional free trade agreements . An active participant in the Summits of the Americas process , El Salvador chairs a working group on market access under the Free Trade Area of the Americas initiative .
In November , 1950 El Salvador helped the newly empowered 14th Dalai Lama by supporting his Tibetan Government cabinet minister 's telegram requesting an appeal before the United Nations General Assembly to stop the Communist China 's People 's Liberation Army 's invasion of Tibet . `` Only the tiny country of El Salvador agreed to sponsor Tibet 's plea . `` `` At the UN , no one was willing to stand up beside El Salvador . The other nations had overriding self-interests , which made it impossible for them to support San Salvador 's attempt to bring the invasion before the General Assembly . '' With no other countries in support , `` the UN unanimously dropped the Tibetan plea from its agenda . ''
El Salvador has an army , air force , and modest navy . There are around 17,000 personnel in the armed forces in total . In 2017 , El Salvador signed the UN treaty on the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons .
===Human rights===
Amnesty International has drawn attention to several arrests of police officers for unlawful police killings . Other issues to gain Amnesty International 's attention include missing children , failure of law enforcement to properly investigate and prosecute crimes against women , and rendering labor unions illegal . Discrimination against LGBT rights in El Salvador in El Salvador is very widespread . According to 2013 survey by the Pew Research Center , 62 % of Salvadorans believe that [ should not be accepted by society .
===Administrative divisions===
El Salvador is Departments of El Salvador ( departamentos ) , which in turn are subdivided into 262 Municipalities of El Salvador ( municipios ) .
Department names and capitals for the 14 Salvadoran Departments :
==Economy==
El Salvador 's economy has been hampered at times by natural disasters such as earthquakes and hurricanes , by government policies that mandate large economic subsidies , and by official corruption . Subsidies became such a problem that in April 2012 , the International Monetary Fund suspended a $ 750 ; million loan to the central government . President Funes ' chief of cabinet , Alex Segovia , acknowledged that the economy was at the `` point of collapse '' .
Gross domestic product ( Gross domestic product ) in purchasing power parity in 2008 was estimated at US $ 25.895 ; billion . The service sector is the largest component of GDP at 64.1 % , followed by the industrial sector at 24.7 % ( 2008 est. ) . Agriculture represents 11.2 % of GDP ( 2010 est . ) The GDP grew after 1996 at an annual rate that averaged 3.2 % real growth . The government committed to free market initiatives , and the 2007 GDP 's real growth rate was 4.7 % .
In December 1999 , net international reserves equalled US $ 1.8 ; billion or roughly five months of imports . Having this hard currency buffer to work with , the Salvadoran government undertook a monetary integration plan beginning in January 2001 by which the U.S. dollar became legal tender alongside the Salvadoran coln , and all formal accounting was done in U.S. dollars . Thus , the government has formally limited the implementing of open market monetary policies to influence short-term variables in the economy . With the adoption of the U.S. dollar , El Salvador lost control over monetary policy . Any counter-cyclical policy response to the downturn must be through fiscal policy , which is constrained by legislative requirements for a two-thirds majority to approve any international financing . As of September 2007 , net Foreign exchange reserves stood at $ 2.42 ; billion .
It has long been a challenge in El Salvador to develop new growth sectors for a more diversified economy . In the past , the country produced gold and silver , but recent attempts to reopen the mining sector , which were expected to add hundreds of millions of dollars to the local economy , collapsed after President Saca shut down the operations of Pacific Rim Mining Corporation . Nevertheless , according to the Central American Institute for Fiscal Studies ( Instituto Centroamericano for Estudios Fiscales ) , the contribution of metallic mining was a minuscule 0.3 % of the country 's GDP between 2010 and 2015 . Saca 's decision although not lacking political motives , had strong support from local residents and grassroots movements in the country . President Funes later rejected a company 's application for a further permit based on the risk of cyanide contamination on one of the country 's main rivers .
As with other former colonies , El Salvador was considered a mono-export economy ( an economy that depended heavily on one type of export ) for many years . During colonial times , El Salvador was a thriving exporter of Indigo dye , but after the invention of synthetic dyes in the 19th century , the newly created modern state turned to coffee as the main export .
The government has sought to improve the collection of its current revenues , with a focus on indirect taxes . A 10 % value-added tax ( IVA in Spanish ) , implemented in September 1992 , was raised to 13 % in July 1995 . Inflation has been steady and among the lowest in the region . Since 1997 inflation has averaged 3 % , with recent years increasing to nearly 5 % . As a result of the free trade agreements , from 2000 to 2006 , total exports have grown 19 % from $ 2.94 ; billion to $ 3.51 ; billion , and total imports have risen 54 % from $ 4.95 ; billion to $ 7.63 ; billion . This has resulted in a 102 % increase in the trade deficit , from $ 2.01 ; billion to $ 4.12 ; billion .
El Salvador has promoted an open trade and investment environment and has embarked on a wave of privatization extending to telecommunications , electricity distribution , banking , and pension funds . In late 2006 , the government and the Millennium Challenge Corporation signed a five-year , $ 461 ; million compact to stimulate economic growth and reduce poverty in the country 's northern region , the primary conflict zone during the civil war , through investments in education , public services , enterprise development , and transportation infrastructure .
In 2006 , El Salvador was the first country to ratify the Central America-Dominican Republic Free Trade Agreement ( CAFTA )  negotiated by the five countries of Central America and the Dominican Republic  with the United States . CAFTA requires that the Salvadoran government adopt policies that foster free trade . CAFTA has bolstered exports of processed foods , sugar , and ethanol , and supported investment in the apparel sector , which faced Asian competition with the expiration of the Multi Fibre Arrangement in 2005 . In anticipation of the declines in the apparel sector 's competitiveness , the previous administration sought to diversify the economy by promoting the country as a regional distribution and logistics hub , and by promoting tourism investment through tax incentives .
===Remittances from abroad===
El Salvador leads the region in remittances per capita , with inflows equivalent to nearly all export income ; about a third of all households receive these financial inflows . Remittances from Salvadorans living and working in the United States , sent to family members in El Salvador , are a major source of foreign income and offset the substantial trade deficit of $ 4.12 ; billion . Remittances have increased steadily in the last decade , and reached an all-time high of $ 3.32 ; billion in 2006 ( an increase of 17 % over the previous year ) . approximately 16.2 % of GDP .
Remittances have had positive and negative effects on El Salvador . In 2005 , the number of people living in extreme poverty in El Salvador was 20 % , according to a United Nations Development Program report . Without remittances , the number of Salvadorans living in extreme poverty would rise to 37 % . While Salvadoran education levels have gone up , wage expectations have risen faster than either skills or productivity . For example , some Salvadorans are no longer willing to take jobs that pay them less than what they receive monthly from family members abroad . This has led to an influx of Hondurans and Nicaraguans who are willing to work for the prevailing wage . Also , the local propensity for consumption over investment has increased .
Money from remittances has increased prices for certain commodities such as real estate . With much higher wages , many Salvadorans abroad can afford higher prices for houses in El Salvador than local Salvadorans , and thus push up the prices that all Salvadorans must pay .
===Official corruption and foreign investment===
In an analysis of ARENA 's electoral defeat in 2009 , the U.S. Embassy in San Salvador pointed to official corruption under the Saca administration as a significant reason for public rejection of continued ARENA government . According to a secret diplomatic cable made public by WikiLeaks , `` While the Salvadoran public may be inured to self-serving behaviour by politicians , many in ARENA believe that the brazen manner in which Saca and his people are widely perceived to have used their positions for personal enrichment went beyond the pale . ARENA deputy Roberto d'Aubuisson , son of ARENA founder Roberto d'Aubuisson , told [ a U.S. diplomat ] that Saca 'deliberately ignored ' his Public Works Minister 's government contract kickbacks scheme , even after the case was revealed in the press . Furthermore , considerable evidence exists , including from U.S. business sources , that the Saca administration pushed laws and selectively enforced regulations with the specific intent to benefit Saca family business interests . ''
Subsequent policies under Funes administrations improved El Salvador to foreign investment , and the World Bank in 2014 rated El Salvador 109 , a little better than Belize ( 118 ) and Nicaragua ( 119 ) in the World Bank 's annual `` Ease of doing business index '' index .
As per Santander Trade , a Spanish think tank in foreign investment , `` Foreign investment into El Salvador has been steadily growing during the last few years . In 2013 , the influx of FDI increased . Nevertheless , El Salvador receives less FDI than other countries of Central America . The government has made little progress in terms of improving the business climate . In addition to this , the limited size of its domestic market , weak infrastructures and institutions , as well as the high level of criminality have been real obstacles to investors . However , El Salvador is the second most `` business friendly '' country in South America in terms of business taxation . It also has a young and skilled labour force and a strategic geographical position . The country 's membership in the DR-CAFTA , as well as its reinforced integration to the C4 countries ( producers of cotton ) should lead to an increase of FDI . ''
Foreign companies have lately resorted to arbitration in international trade tribunals in total disagreement with Salvadoran government policies . In 2008 , El Salvador sought international arbitration against Italy 's Enel Green Power , on behalf of Salvadoran state-owned electric companies for a geothermal project Enel had invested in . Four years later , Enel indicated it would seek arbitration against El Salvador , blaming the government for technical problems that prevent it from completing its investment . The government came to its defence claiming that Art 109 of the constitution does not allow any government ( regardless of the party they belong ) , to privatize the resources of the national soil ( in this case geothermic energy ) . The dispute came to an end in December 2014 when both parties came to a settlement , from which no details have been released . The small country had yielded to pressure from the Washington based powerful International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes . The U.S. Embassy warned in 2009 that the Salvadoran government 's populist policies of mandating artificially low electricity prices were damaging private sector profitability , including the interests of American investors in the energy sector . The U.S. Embassy noted the corruption of El Salvador 's judicial system and quietly urged American businesses to include `` arbitration clauses , preferably with a foreign venue '' , when doing business in the country .
A 2008 report by the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development indicates that one third of the generation of electricity in El Salvador was publicly owned while two thirds was in American hands and other foreign ownership . It is only natural for a small , under-developed country like El Salvador to subsidize some of the resources for the vast majority of its poor population . In terms of how people perceived the levels of public corruption in 2014 , El Salvador ranks 80 out of 175 countries as per the Corruption Perception Index . El Salvador 's rating compares relatively well with Panama ( 94 of 175 ) and Costa Rica ( 47 of 175 ) .
===Tourism===
It was estimated that 1,394,000 international tourists visited El Salvador in 2014.Tourism contributed US $ 2970.1 ; million to El Salvador 's GDP in 2019 . This represented 11 % of total GDP . Tourism directly supported 80,500 jobs in 2013 . This represented 3.1 % of total employment in El Salvador . In 2019 , tourism indirectly supported 317,200 jobs , representing 11.6 % of total employment in El Salvador .
Most North American and European tourists seek out El Salvador 's beaches and nightlife . El Salvador 's tourism landscape is slightly different from those of other Central American countries . Because of its geographic size and urbanization there are not many nature-themed tourist destinations such as ecotours or archaeological sites open to the public . According to the El Salvadoran newspaper El Diario De Hoy , the top 10 attractions are : the coastal beaches , La Libertad , La Libertad , Ruta Las Flores , Suchitoto , Playa Las Flores in San Miguel , El Salvador , La Palma , Santa Ana Volcano ( location of the country 's highest volcano ) , Nahuizalco , Apaneca , Juayua , and San Ignacio , Chalatenango .
Surfing is a natural tourism sector that has gained popularity in recent years as Salvadoran beaches have become increasingly popular . Surfers visit many beaches on the coast of La Libertad and the east end of El Salvador . The use of the U.S. dollar as Salvadoran currency and direct flights of 4 to 6 hours from most cities in the United States are factors that attract American tourists . Urbanization and Americanization of Salvadoran culture has led to the abundance of American-style malls , stores , and restaurants in the three main urban areas , especially greater San Salvador .
==Infrastructure==
The level of access Water supply and sanitation in El Salvador has been increased significantly . A 2015 conducted study by the University of North Carolina called El Salvador the country that has achieved the greatest progress in the world in terms of increased access to water supply and sanitation and the reduction of inequity in access between urban and rural areas . However , water resources are seriously polluted and a large part of the wastewater discharged into the environment without any treatment . Institutionally a single public institution is both de facto in charge of setting sector policy and of being the main service provider . Attempts at reforming and modernizing the sector through new laws have not borne fruit over the past 20 years .
The airport serving international flights in El Salvador is Monseor scar Arnulfo Romero International Airport . This airport is located about southeast of San Salvador .

The capital city of San Salvador has a population of about 2.1 ; million people . An estimated 42 % of El Salvador 's population live in rural areas . Urbanization has expanded at a phenomenal rate in El Salvador since the 1960s , with millions moving to the cities and creating associated problems for urban planning and services .
There are up to 100,000 Nicaraguans living in El Salvador .
===Ethnic groups===
El Salvador 's population is composed of mixed races as well as people of indigenous , European , or Afro-descendant ancestry among smaller diasporas of Middle and Far Eastern groups . Eighty-six per cent of Salvadorans identify with mestizo ancestry . 12.7 % of Salvadorans report as White Latin American # El Salvador , mostly of ethnically Spaniards , while there are also Salvadorans of French people , Germans , Swiss people , English people , Irish people , and Italians descent . Most Central European immigrants in El Salvador arrived during World War II as refugees from the Czech Republic , Germany , Hungary , Poland , and Switzerland . There are also small communities of Jews , Palestinian Christians , and Arab Muslims ( in particular Palestinian Salvadoran ) .
0.23 % of the population report as fully indigenous . The ethnic groups are Kakawira which represents 0.07 % of the total country 's population , Pipil people ( 0.06 % ) , Lenca people ( 0.04 % ) and other minor groups ( 0.06 % ) . Very few Amerindians have retained their customs and traditions , having over time assimilated into the dominant mestizo culture . There is a small Afro-Salvadorans Afro-Salvadoran group that is 0.13 % of the total population , with Blacks , among other races , having been prevented from immigrating via government policies in the early 20th century . The descendants of enslaved Africans , however , had already integrated into the Salvadoran population and culture well before , during the colonial and post-colonial period .
Among the immigrant groups in El Salvador , Palestinian Christians stand out . Though few in number , their descendants have attained great economic and political power in the country , as evidenced by the election of President Antonio Saca , whose opponent in the 2004 election , Schafik Handal , was also of Palestinian descent , and the flourishing commercial , industrial , and construction firms owned by this ethnic group .
, there were approximately 3.2 ; million Salvadorans living outside El Salvador , with the United States traditionally being the destination of choice for Salvadoran economic migrants . By 2012 , there were about 2.0 ; million Salvadoran immigrants and Salvadoran Americans in the U.S. , making them the sixth largest immigrant group in the country . The second destination of Salvadorans living outside is Guatemala , with more than 111,000 persons , mainly in Guatemala City . Salvadorans also live in other nearby countries such as Belize , Honduras and Nicaragua . Other countries with notable Salvadoran communities include Canada , Mexico , the United Kingdom ( including the Cayman Islands ) , Sweden , Brazil , Italy , Colombia , and Australia .
===Languages===
Castillian , also known as Spanish , is the official language and is spoken by virtually all inhabitants , although some indigenous people speak also their native tongues , such as Pipil language and Poqomam language . Q'eqchi ' language Q'eqchi ' is spoken by immigrants of Guatemalan and Belizean indigenous people living in El Salvador .
Like other regions of Central and South America , Salvadoran use voseo . This refers to the use of `` vos '' as the second person pronoun , instead of `` t '' .The local Spanish vernacular is called Salvadoran Spanish , which is considered informal .
===Largest cities===
===Religion===
The majority of the population in El Salvador is Christians . Catholic Church ( 47 % ) and Protestantism ( 33 % ) are the two major religious groups in the country , with the Catholic Church the largest denomination . Those not affiliated with any religious group amount to 17 % of the population . The remainder of the population ( 3 % ) is made up of Jehovah 's Witnesses , Hare Krishnas , Muslims , Jews , Buddhists , Latter-day Saints , and those adhering to indigenous religious beliefs . The number of evangelicals in the country is growing rapidly . scar Romero , the first Salvadoran saint , was canonized by Pope Francis on 14 October 2018.
==Education==
The public education system in El Salvador is severely lacking in resources . Class sizes in public schools can be as large as 50 children per classroom . Salvadorans who can afford the cost often choose to send their children to private schools , which are regarded as being better-quality than public schools . Most private schools follow American , European or other advanced systems . Lower-income families are forced to rely on public education .
Education in El Salvador is free through high school . After nine years of basic education ( elementarymiddle school ) , students have the option of a two-year high school or a three-year high school . A two-year high school prepares the student for transfer to a university . A three-year high school allows the student to graduate and enter the workforce in a vocational career , or to transfer to a university to further their education in their chosen field .
List of universities in El Salvador include a central public institution , the Universidad de El Salvador , and many other specialized private universities .
==Crime==
Since the early twenty-first century , El Salvador has experienced high crime rates , including gang-related crimes and juvenile delinquency . El Salvador had the highest murder rate in the world in 2012 but experienced a sharp decline in 2019 with a new centrist government in power . It is also considered an epicentre of a gang crisis , along with Guatemala and Honduras . In response to this , the government has set up countless programs to try to guide the youth away from gang membership ; so far its efforts have not produced any quick results . One of the government programs was a gang reform called `` La Mano Dura '' ( Super Firm Hand ) . Super Mano Dura had little success and was highly criticized by the United Nations . It experienced temporary success in 2004 but there was a rise in crime after 2005 . In 2004 , there were 41 intentional homicides per 100,000 citizens , with 60 % of the homicides committed being gang-related . In 2012 , the homicide rate had increased to 66 per 100,000 inhabitants , more than triple the rate in Mexico . There are an estimated 25,000 gang members at large in El Salvador with another 9,000 in prison . The most well-known gangs , called `` mara ( gang ) '' in colloquial Spanish , are MS-13 and their rivals 18th Street gang . Maras are hunted by death squads including Sombra Negra . New rivals also include the rising mara , The Rebels 13.
, El Salvador has seen a 40 % drop in crime due to what the Salvadoran government called a gang truce ; however , extortion affecting small businesses are not taken into account . In early 2012 , there were an average of 16 killings per day ; in late March of that year that number dropped to fewer than 5 per day . On 14 April 2012 for the first time in over 3 years there were no killings in El Salvador . Overall , there were 411 killings in January 2012 , and in March the number was 188 , more than a 40 % reduction , while crime in neighbouring Honduras had risen to an all-time high . In 2014 , crime rose 56 % in El Salvador , with the government attributing the rise to a break in the truce between the two major gangs in El Salvador , which began having turf wars .
Presently , the Alto al Crimen or Crime Stoppers program is in operation and provides financial rewards for information leading to the capture of gang leadership . The reward often ranges between US $ 100 and $ 500 per call .
==Culture==
Pulling from indigenous , colonial Spanish and African influences , a composite population was formed as a result of intermarrying between the natives , European settlers , and enslaved Africans . The Catholic Church plays an important role in the Salvadoran culture . Archbishop scar Romero is a national hero for his role in resisting human rights violations that were occurring in the lead-up to the Salvadoran Civil War . Significant foreign personalities in El Salvador were the Jesuit priests and professors Ignacio Ellacura , Ignacio Martn-Bar , and Segundo Montes , who were murdered in 1989 by the Salvadoran Army during the height of the civil war .
Painting , ceramics and textiles are the principal manual artistic mediums . Writers Francisco Gavidia , Salarru ( Salvador Salazar Arru ) , Claudia Lars , Alfredo Espino , Pedro Geoffroy Rivas , Manlio Argueta , Jos Roberto Cea , and poet Roque Dalton are important writers from El Salvador . Notable 20th-century personages include the late filmmaker Baltasar Polio , female film director Patricia Chica , artist Fernando Llort , and caricaturist Too Salazar .
Among the more renowned representatives of the graphic arts are the painters Augusto Crespin , Noe Canjura , Carlos Caas , Giovanni Gil , Julia Daz , Mauricio Mejia , Maria Elena Palomo de Mejia , Camilo Minero , Ricardo Carbonell , Roberto Huezo , Miguel Angel Cerna , ( the painter and writer better known as MACLo ) , Esael Araujo , and many others .
===Public holidays===
===Cuisine===
One of El Salvador 's notable dishes is the pupusa . Pupusas are handmade corn tortillas ( made of masa or masa de arroz , a maize or rice flour dough used in Latin American cuisine ) stuffed with one or more of the following : cheese ( usually a soft Salvadoran cheese such as quesillo , similar to mozzarella ) , chicharrn , or refried beans . Sometimes the filling is queso con loroco ( cheese combined with loroco , a vine flower bud native to Central America ) . Pupusas revueltas are pupusas filled with beans , cheese and pork . There are also vegetarian options . Some adventurous restaurants even offer pupusas stuffed with shrimp or spinach . The name pupusa comes from the Pipil-Nahuatl word , pupushahua . The origins of the pupusa are debated , although its presence in El Salvador is known to predate the arrival of the Spaniards .
Two other typical Salvadoran dishes are yuca frita and panes con pollo . Yuca frita is deep fried cassava root served with curtido ( a pickled cabbage , onion and carrot topping ) and pork rinds with pescaditas ( fried baby sardines ) . Yuca is sometimes served boiled instead of fried . Pan con pollo/pavo ( bread with chicken/turkey ) are warm turkey or chicken-filled submarine sandwiches . The bird is marinated and then roasted with spices and hand-pulled . This sandwich is traditionally served with tomato and watercress along with cucumber , onion , lettuce , mayonnaise , and mustard .
One of El Salvador 's typical breakfasts is fried plantain , usually served with cream . It is common in Salvadoran restaurants and homes , including those of immigrants to the United States . Alguashte , a condiment made from dried , ground pepitas , is commonly incorporated into savoury and sweet Salvadoran dishes . `` Maria Luisa '' is a dessert commonly found in El Salvador . It is a layered cake that is soaked in orange marmalade and sprinkled with powdered sugar . One of the most popular desserts is the cake Pastel de tres leches ( Cake of three milks ) , consisting of three types of milk : evaporated milk , condensed milk , and cream .
A popular drink that Salvadorans enjoy is [ Horchata is most commonly made of the morro seed ] ground into a powder and added to milk or water , and sugar . Horchata is drank year-round , and can be drank at any time of day . It mostly is accompanied by a plate of pupusas or fried yuca . Horchata from El Salvador has a very distinct taste and is not to be confused with Mexican horchata , which is rice-based . Coffee is also a common morning beverage . Other popular drinks in El Salvador include ensalada , a drink made of chopped fruit swimming in fruit juice , and Kolachampan , a sugar cane-flavoured carbonated beverage .
===Music===
Traditional Salvadoran music is a mixture of indigenous , Spanish , and African influences . It includes religious songs ( mostly used to celebrate Christmas and other holidays , especially feast days of the saints ) . Other musical repertoire consists of danza , pasillo , marcha and cancione which are composed of parading bands , street performances , or onstage dances , either in groups or paired . Satirical and rural lyrical themes are common . Traditional instruments used are the [ [ marimba , tepehuaste , flutes , drums , Giro and gourds , as well as guitars among others . El Salvador 's well known folk dance is known as Xuc which originated in Cojutepeque , Cuscatlan . Caribbean , Colombian , and Mexican music has become customary listening radio and party in the country , especially boleros , cumbia , merengue , Latin pop , salsa , bachata , and reggaeton .
===Sport===
association football is the most popular sport in El Salvador . The El Salvador national football team qualified for the FIFA World Cup in 1970 FIFA World Cup and 1982 FIFA World Cup . Their qualification for the 1970 tournament was marred by the Football War , a war against Honduras , whose team El Salvador 's had defeated . The national football team play at the Estadio Cuscatln in San Salvador . It opened in 1976 and seats 53,400 , making it the largest stadium in Central America and the Caribbean .

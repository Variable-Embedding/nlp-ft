==Etymology==
`` Romania '' derives from Latin wikt : romanus , meaning `` Roman people '' or `` of Ancient Rome '' . The first known use of the appellation was attested to in the 16th ; century by Italians humanists travelling in Transylvania , Moldavia , and Wallachia .
The oldest known surviving document written in Romanian language , a 1521 letter known as the `` Neacu 's letter '' , is notable for including the first documented occurrence of the country 's name : Wallachia is mentioned as eara Rumneasc ( old spelling for `` The Romanian Land '' ; eara from the Latin terra , `` land '' ; current spelling : ara Romneasc ) .
Two spelling forms : romn and rumn were used interchangeably until sociolinguistic developments in the late 17th ; century led to semantic differentiation of the two forms : rumn came to mean `` indentured servant '' , while romn retained the original ethnolinguistic meaning . After the abolition of serfdom in 1746 , the word rumn gradually fell out of use and the spelling stabilised to the form romn . Tudor Vladimirescu , a revolutionary leader of the early 19th ; century , used the term Rumnia to refer exclusively to the principality of Wallachia .
The use of the name Romania to refer to the common homeland of all Romaniansits modern-day meaningwas first documented in the early 19th ; century.On the [ of Gheorghe Lazr ] in [ [ Avrig ( built in 1823 ) there is the inscription : `` Precum Hristos pe Lazr din mori a nviat/Aa tu Romnia din somn ai deteptat . ''
In English , the name of the country was formerly spelt Rumania or Roumania . Romania became the predominant spelling around 1975 . Romania is also the official English-language spelling used by the Romanian government . A handful of other languages ( including Italian , Hungarian , Portuguese , and Norwegian ) have also switched to `` o '' like English , but most languages continue to prefer forms with u , e.g . French Roumanie , German and Swedish Rumnien , Spanish Rumania ( the archaic form Rumana is still in use in Spain ) , Polish Rumunia , Russian  ( Rumyniya ) , and Japanese ( Rmania ) .

==History==
===Prehistory===
Human remains found in Petera cu Oase ( `` Cave with Bones '' ) , radiocarbon dated as being from circa 40,000 years ago , represent the oldest known Homo sapiens in Europe . Neolithic techniques and agriculture spread after the arrival of a mixed group of people from Thessaly in the 6th ; millennium BC . Excavations near a salt spring at Vntori-Neam yielded the earliest evidence for salt exploitation in Europe ; here salt production began between 5th millennium BC and 4th BC . The first permanent settlements also appeared in the Neolithic . Some of them developed into `` proto-cities '' , which were larger than . The CucuteniTrypillia culturethe best known archaeological culture of Old Europe ( archaeology ) flourished in Muntenia , southeastern Transylvania and northeastern Moldavia in the 3rd ; millennium ; BC .
The first fortified settlements appeared around 1800 ; BC , showing the militant character of Bronze Age societies .
===Antiquity===
Greek colonies established on the Black Sea coast in the 7th ; century ; BC became important centres of commerce with the local tribes . Among the native peoples , Herodotus listed the Getae of the Lower Danube region , the Agathyrsi of Transylvania and the Syginnae of the plains along the river Tisza at the beginning of the 5th ; century ; BC . Centuries later , Strabo associated the Getae with the Dacians who dominated the lands along the southern Carpathian Mountains in the 1st ; century ; BC . Burebista was the first Dacian ruler to unite the local tribes . He also conquered the Greek colonies in Dobruja and the neighbouring peoples as far as the Middle Danube and the Balkan Mountains between around 55 ; and ; 44 BC . After Burebista was murdered in 44 ; BC , his empire collapsed .
The Romans reached Dacia during Burebista 's reign and conquered Dobruja in 46 ; AD . Dacia was again united under Decebalus around 85 ; AD . He resisted the Romans for decades , but the Roman army defeated his troops in 106 ; AD . Emperor Trajan transformed Banat , Oltenia and the greater part of Transylvania into the new Roman province of Roman Dacia , but Dacian , Germanic peoples and Sarmatians tribes continued to dominate the lands along the Roman frontiers . The Romans pursued an organised colonisation policy , and the provincials enjoyed a long period of peace and prosperity in the 2nd ; century . Scholars accepting the Daco-Roman continuity theoryone of the main theories about the origin of the Romanianssay that the cohabitation of the native Dacians and the Roman colonists in Roman Dacia was the first phase of the Romanians ' ethnogenesis .
The Carpians , Goths and other neighbouring tribes made regular raids against Dacia from the ; 210s . The Romans could not resist , and Emperor Aurelian ordered the evacuation of the province Dacia Trajana in ; 271 . Scholars supporting the continuity theory are convinced that most Latin-speaking commoners stayed behind when the army and civil administration was withdrawn . The Romans did not abandon their fortresses along the northern banks of the Lower Danube for decades , and Dobruja ( known as Scythia Minor ) remained an integral part of the Roman Empire until the early 7th ; century .
===Middle Ages===
The Goths were expanding towards the Lower Danube from the ; 230s , forcing the native peoples to flee to the Roman Empire or to accept their suzerainty . The Goths ' rule ended abruptly when the Huns invaded their territory in ; 376 , causing new waves of migrations . The Huns forced the remnants of the local population into submission , but their empire collapsed in ; 454 . The Gepids took possession of the former Dacia province . The nomadic Pannonian Avars defeated the Gepids and established a powerful empire around ; 570 . The Bulgars , who also came from the Eurasian steppes , occupied the Lower Danube region in ; 680.
Place names that are of Slavic languages origin abound in Romania , indicating that a significant Slavic-speaking population used to live in the territory . The first Early Slavs groups settled in Moldavia and Wallachia in the 6th ; century , in Transylvania around ; 600 . After the Avar Khaganate collapsed in the ; 790s , Bulgaria became the dominant power of the region , occupying lands as far as the river Tisa . The Council of Preslav declared Old Church Slavonic the language of liturgy in the First Bulgarian Empire in ; 893 . The Romanians also adopted Old Church Slavonic as their liturgical language .
The Magyars ( or Hungarians ) took control of the steppes north of the Lower Danube in the ; 830s , but the Bulgarians and the Pechenegs jointly forced them to abandon this region for the Great Hungarian Plain around ; 894 . Centuries later , the Gesta Hungarorum wrote of the invading Magyars ' wars against three dukesGlad ( duke ) , Menumorut and the Vlach Geloufor Banat , Criana and Transylvania . The Gesta also listed many peoplesSlavs , Bulgarians , Vlachs , Khazars , and Szkelysinhabiting the same regions . The reliability of the Gesta is debated . Some scholars regard it as a basically accurate account , others describe it as a literary work filled with invented details . The Pechenegs seized the lowlands abandoned by the Hungarians to the east of the Carpathians .
Byzantine Empire missionaries proselytised in the lands east of the Tisa from the ; 940s and Byzantine troops occupied Dobruja in the ; 970s . The first king of Hungary , Stephen I of Hungary Stephen ; I , who supported Western European missionaries , defeated the local chieftains and established Catholic Church in Romania ( office of a bishop ) in Transylvania and Banat in the early 11th ; century . Significant Pecheneg groups fled to the Byzantine Empire in the ; 1040s ; the Oghuz Turks followed them , and the nomadic Cumans became the dominant power of the steppes in the ; 1060s . Cooperation between the Cumans and the Vlachs against the Byzantine Empire is well documented from the end of the 11th ; century . Scholars who reject the Daco-Roman continuity theory say that the first Vlach groups left their Balkan Peninsula homeland for the mountain pastures of the eastern and southern Carpathians in the 11th ; century , establishing the Romanians ' presence in the lands to the north of the Lower Danube .
Exposed to nomadic incursions , Transylvania developed into an important border province of the Kingdom of Hungary . The Szkelysa community of free warriorssettled in central Transylvania around ; 1100 and moved to the easternmost regions around ; 1200 . Colonists from the Holy Roman Empirethe Transylvanian Saxons ' ancestorscame to the province in the ; 1150s . A high-ranking royal official , styled Voivode of Transylvania , ruled the Transylvanian Counties of Hungary ( before 1920 ) from the ; 1170s , but the Szkely and Saxon Seat ( territorial administrative unit ) ( or districts ) were not subject to the voivodes ' authority . Royal charters wrote of the `` Vlachs ' land '' in southern Transylvania in the early 13th ; century , indicating the existence of Romanian district . Papal correspondence mentions the activities of Orthodox prelates among the Romanians in Muntenia in the ; 1230s . Also in the 13th ; century , during one of its greatest periods of expansion , the Republic of Genoa started establishing many Genoese colonies and commercial and military ports on the Black Sea , in the current territory of Romania . The largest Genoese colonies in present-day Romania were Calafat ( still known as such ) , Constana ( Costanza ) , Galai ( Caladda ) , Giurgiu ( San Giorgio ) , Licostomo and Vicina ( town ) ( unknown modern location ) . These would last until the 15th ; century .
The Mongols destroyed large territories during Mongol invasion of Europe in ; 1241 and ; 1242 . The Mongols ' Golden Horde emerged as the dominant power of Eastern Europe , but Bla ; IV of Hungary 's land grant to the Knights Hospitallers in Oltenia and Muntenia shows that the local Vlach rulers were subject to the king 's authority in ; 1247 . Basarab ; I of Wallachia united the Romanian polities between the southern Carpathians and the Lower Danube in the ; 1310s . He defeated the Hungarian royal army in the Battle of Posada and secured the independence of Principality of Wallachia in ; 1330 . The second Romanian principality , Principality of Moldavia , achieved full autonomy during the reign of Bogdan I of Moldavia Bogdan ; I around ; 1360 . A local dynasty ruled the Despotate of Dobruja in the second half of the 14th ; century , but the Ottoman Empire took possession of the territory after ; 1388.
Princes Mircea I of Wallachia Mircea ; I and Vlad the Impaler Vlad ; III of Wallachia , and Stephen the Great Stephen ; III of Moldavia defended their countries ' independence against the Ottomans . Most Wallachian and Moldavian princes paid a regular tribute to the Ottoman sultans from ; 1417 and ; 1456 , respectively . A military commander of Romanian origin , John Hunyadi , organised the defence of the Kingdom of Hungary until his death in ; 1456 . Increasing taxes outraged the Transylvanian peasants , and Transylvanian peasant revolt in ; 1437 , but the Hungarian nobles and the heads of the Saxon and Szkely communities jointly suppressed their revolt . The formal alliance of the Hungarian , Saxon , and Szkely leaders , known as the Unio Trium Nationum , became an important element of the self-government of Transylvania . The Orthodox Romanian Knez ( Vlach leader ) ( `` chiefs '' ) were excluded from the Union .
===Early Modern Times and national awakening===
The Kingdom of Hungary collapsed , and the Ottomans occupied parts of Banat and Criana in 1541 . Transylvania and Maramure , along with the rest of Banat and Criana developed into a new state under Ottoman suzerainty , the Principality of Transylvania ( 15701711 ) . Reformation spread and four denominationsReformed Church in Romania , Evangelical Church of Augustan Confession in Romania , Unitarian Church of Transylvania , and Roman Catholicismwere officially acknowledged in 1568 . The Romanians ' Orthodox faith remained only tolerated , although they made up more than one-third of the population , according to 17th-century estimations .
The princes of Transylvania , Wallachia , and Moldavia joined the Holy League ( 1594 ) against the Ottoman Empire in 1594 . The Wallachian prince , Michael the Brave , united the three principalities under his rule in May ; 1600 . The neighboring powers forced him to abdicate in September , but he became a symbol of the unification of the Romanian lands in the 19th ; century . Although the rulers of the three principalities continued to pay tribute to the Ottomans , the most talented princesGabriel Bethlen of Transylvania , Matei Basarab of Wallachia , and Vasile Lupu of Moldaviastrengthened their autonomy .
The united armies of the Holy League ( 1684 ) expelled the Ottoman troops from Central Europe between 1684 and 1699 , and the Principality of Transylvania was integrated into the Habsburg Monarchy . The Habsburgs supported the Catholic clergy and persuaded the Orthodox Romanian prelates to accept the church union in 1699 . The Church Union strengthened the Romanian intellectuals ' devotion to their Roman heritage . The Orthodox Church was restored in Transylvania only after Orthodox monks stirred up revolts in 1744 and 1759 . The organization of the Transylvanian Military Frontier caused further disturbances , Siculicidium .
Princes Dimitrie Cantemir of Moldavia and Constantin Brncoveanu of Wallachia concluded alliances with the Habsburg Monarchy and Russia against the Ottomans , but they were dethroned in 1711 and 1714 , respectively . The sultans lost confidence in the native princes and appointed Orthodox merchants from the Fener district of Istanbul to rule Moldova and Wallachia . The Phanariotes princes pursued oppressive fiscal policies and dissolved the army . The neighboring powers took advantage of the situation : the Habsburg Monarchy annexed the northwestern part of Moldavia , or Bukovina , in 1775 , and the Russian Empire seized the eastern half of Moldavia , or Bessarabia , in 1812.
A census revealed that the Romanians were more numerous than any other ethnic group in Transylvania in 1733 , but legislation continued to use contemptuous adjectives ( such as `` tolerated '' and `` admitted '' ) when referring to them . The Romanian Greek Catholic Church , Inoceniu Micu-Klein who demanded recognition of the Romanians as the fourth privileged nation was forced into exile . Uniate and Orthodox clerics and laymen jointly signed a Supplex Libellus Valachorum plea for the Transylvanian Romanians ' emancipation in 1791 , but the monarch and the local authorities refused to grant their requests .
===Independence and monarchy===
The Treaty of Kk Kaynarca authorised the Russian ambassador in Istanbul to defend the autonomy of Moldavia and Wallachia ( known as the Danubian Principalities ) in 1774 . Taking advantage of the Greek War of Independence , a Wallachian lesser nobleman , Tudor Vladimirescu , stirred up a revolt against the Ottomans in January ; 1821 , but he was murdered in June by Phanariot Greeks . After a Russo-Turkish War ( 182829 ) new Russo-Turkish War , the Treaty of Adrianople ( 1829 ) strengthened the autonomy of the Danubian Principalities in ; 1829 , although it also acknowledged the sultan 's right to confirm the election of the princes .
Mihail Koglniceanu , Nicolae Blcescu and other leaders of the Moldavian Revolution of 1848 and Wallachian Revolution of 1848 demanded the emancipation of the peasants and the union of the two principalities , but Russian and Ottoman troops crushed their revolt . The Wallachian revolutionists were the first to adopt the blue , yellow and red Tricolour ( flag ) as the Flag of Romania . In Transylvania , most Romanians supported the imperial government against the Hungarian Revolution of 1848 after the Diet passed a law concerning the union of Transylvania and Hungary . Bishop Andrei aguna proposed the unification of the Romanians of the Habsburg Monarchy in a separate duchy , but the central government refused to change the internal borders .
The Treaty of Paris ( 1856 ) put the Danubian Principalities under the collective guardianship of the International relations of the Great Powers ( 18141919 ) in ; 1856 . After Ad hoc Divans convoked in Moldavia and Wallachia urged the unification of the two principalities , the Great Powers did not prevent the election of Alexandru Ioan Cuza as their collective domnitor ( or ruling prince ) in January 1859 . The United Principalities of Moldavia and Wallachia officially adopted the name Romania on 21 ; February 1862 . Cuza 's government carried out a series of reforms , including the secularisation of the property of monasteries and agrarian reform , but a coalition of conservative and radical politicians forced him to abdicate in February ; 1866.
Cuza 's successor , a German prince , Carol I of Romania Karl of Hohenzollern-Sigmaringen ( or Carol ; I ) , was elected in May . The parliament adopted the 1866 Constitution of Romania in the same year . The Great Powers acknowledged Romania 's full independence at the Congress of Berlin and Carol ; I was crowned king in 1881 . The Congress also granted the Danube Delta and Dobruja to Romania . Although Romanian scholars strove for the unification of all Romanians into a Greater Romania , the government did not openly support their Irredentism projects .
The Transylvanian Romanians and Saxons wanted to maintain the separate status of Transylvania in the Habsburg Monarchy , but the Austro-Hungarian Compromise of 1867 Austro-Hungarian Compromise brought about the union of the province with Hungary in ; 1867 . Ethnic Romanian politicians sharply opposed the Hungarian government 's attempts to transform Hungary into a national state , especially the laws prescribing the obligatory teaching of Hungarian . Leaders of the Romanian National Party proposed the federalisation of Austria-Hungary and the Romanian intellectuals established a cultural association to promote the use of Romanian .
===World Wars and Greater Romania===
Fearing Russian expansionism , Romania secretly joined the Triple Alliance ( 1882 ) of Germany , Austria-Hungary , and Italy in ; 1883 , but public opinion remained hostile to Austria-Hungary . Romania seized Southern Dobruja from Bulgaria in the Second Balkan War in 1913 . German and Austrian-Hungarian diplomacy supported Bulgaria during the war , bringing about a rapprochement between Romania and the Triple Entente of France , Russia and the United Kingdom . The country remained neutral when World War ; I broke out in ; 1914 , but Prime Minister Ion I. C. Brtianu started negotiations with the Entente Powers . After they promised Austrian-Hungarian territories with a majority of ethnic Romanian population to Romania in the Treaty of Bucharest ( 1916 ) , Romania entered the war against the Central Powers in 1916 . The German and Austrian-Hungarian troops defeated the Romanian army and occupied three-quarters of the country by early ; 1917 . After the October Revolution turned Russia from an ally into an enemy , Romania was forced to sign a Treaty of Bucharest ( 1918 ) with the Central Powers in May ; 1918 , but the collapse of Russia also enabled the union of Bessarabia with Romania . Ferdinand I of Romania again mobilised the Romanian army on behalf of the Entente Powers a day before Armistice of 11 November 1918 on 11 ; November 1918.
Austria-Hungary quickly disintegrated after the war . The General Congress of Bukovina proclaimed Union of Bukovina with Romania on 28 ; November 1918 , and the 1918 Romanian National Assembly election proclaimed Union of Transylvania with Romania the union of Transylvania , Banat , Criana and Maramure with the kingdom on 1 ; December . Peace treaties with Austria , Bulgaria and Hungary delineated the new borders in 1919 and 1920 , but the Soviet Union did not acknowledge the loss of Bessarabia . Romania achieved its greatest territorial extent , expanding from the pre-war . A new electoral system granted voting rights to all adult male citizens , and a series of radical agrarian reforms transformed the country into a `` nation of small landowners '' between 1918 and 1921 . Gender equality as a principle was enacted , but women could not vote or be candidates . Calypso Botez established the National Council of Romanian Women to promote feminist ideas . Romania was a multiethnic country , with ethnic minorities making up about 30 % ; of the population , but the 1923 Constitution of Romania declared it a unitary national state in 1923 . Although minorities could establish their own schools , Romanian language , history and geography could only be taught in Romanian .
Agriculture remained the principal sector of economy , but several branches of industryespecially the production of coal , oil , metals , synthetic rubber , explosives and cosmeticsdeveloped during the interwar period . With oil production of 5.8 ; million tons in 1930 , Romania ranked sixth in the world . Two parties , the National Liberal Party ( Romania , 1875 ) and the National Peasants ' Party , dominated political life , but the Great Depression brought about significant changes in the 1930s . The democratic parties were squeezed between conflicts with the fascist and anti-Semitic Iron Guard and the authoritarian tendencies of Carol II of Romania King Carol ; II . The King promulgated a 1938 Constitution of Romania and dissolved the political parties in 1938 , replacing the parliamentary system with a royal dictatorship .
The 1938 Munich Agreement convinced King Carol ; II that France and the United Kingdom could not defend Romanian interests . German preparations for a new war required the regular supply of Romanian oil and agricultural products . The two countries concluded a treaty concerning the coordination of their economic policies in 1939 , but the King could not persuade Adolf Hitler to guarantee Romania 's frontiers . Romania was forced to Soviet occupation of Bessarabia and Northern Bukovina on 26 ; June 1940 , Northern Transylvania to Hungary on 30 ; August , and Southern Dobruja to Bulgaria in September . After the territorial losses , the King was forced to abdicate in favour of his minor son , Michael I of Romania Michael ; I , on 6 ; September , and Romania was transformed into a National Legionary State national-legionary state under the leadership of General Ion Antonescu . Antonescu signed the Tripartite Pact of Germany , Italy and Japan on 23 ; November . The Iron Guard staged a coup against Antonescu , but he crushed the riot with German support and introduced a military dictatorship in early 1941.
Romania entered World War ; II soon after the Operation Barbarossa in June 1941 . The country regained Bessarabia and Northern Bukovina , and the Germans placed Transnistria Governorate ( the territory between the rivers Dniester and Dnieper ) under Romanian administration . Romanian and German troops massacred at least 160,000 local Jews in these territories ; more than 105,000 Jews and about 11,000 Gypsies died during their deportation from Bessarabia to Transnistria . Most of the Jewish population of Moldavia , Wallachia , Banat and Southern Transylvania survived , but their fundamental rights were limited . After the Operation Margarethe in March 1944 , about 132,000 Jews  mainly Hungarian-speaking  were deported to extermination camps from Northern Transylvania with the Hungarian authorities ' support .
After the Soviet victory in the Battle of Stalingrad in 1943 , Iuliu Maniu , a leader of the opposition to Antonescu , entered into secret negotiations with British diplomats who made it clear that Romania had to seek reconciliation with the Soviet Union . To facilitate the coordination of their activities against Antonescu 's regime , the National Liberal and National Peasants ' parties established the National Democratic Bloc , which also included the Romanian Social Democratic Party ( 192748 ) and Romanian Communist Party parties . After a successful Soviet offensive , the young King Michael 's Coup King Michael ; I ordered Antonescu 's arrest and appointed politicians from the National Democratic Bloc to form a new government on 23 ; August 1944 . Romania switched sides during the war , and nearly 250,000 Romanian troops joined the Red Army 's military campaign against Hungary and Germany , but Joseph Stalin regarded the country as an occupied territory within the Soviet sphere of influence . Stalin 's deputy instructed the King to make the Communists ' candidate , Petru Groza , the prime minister in March 1945 . The Romanian administration in Northern Transylvania was soon restored , and Groza 's government carried out an agrarian reform . In February 1947 , the Paris Peace Treaties , 1947 confirmed the return of Northern Transylvania to Romania , but they also legalised the presence of units of the Red Army in the country .
===Communism===
During the Soviet occupation of Romania , the Communist-dominated government called for new 1946 Romanian general election in 1946 , which they Electoral fraud , with a fabricated 70 % ; majority of the vote . Thus , they rapidly established themselves as the dominant political force . Gheorghe Gheorghiu-Dej , a Communist party leader imprisoned in 1933 , escaped in 1944 to become Romania 's first Communist leader . In February 1947 , he and others forced King Michael ; I to Abdication and leave the country and proclaimed Romania a people 's republic . Romania remained under the direct military occupation and economic control of the USSR until the late 1950s . During this period , Romania 's vast natural resources were drained continuously by mixed Soviet-Romanian companies ( SovRoms ) set up for unilateral exploitative purposes .
In 1948 , the state began to nationalization in Romania private firms and to collectivization in Romania agriculture . Until the early 1960s , the government severely curtailed political liberties and vigorously suppressed any dissent with the help of the Securitatethe Romanian secret police . During this period the regime launched several campaigns of purges during which numerous `` enemies of the state '' and `` parasite elements '' were targeted for different forms of punishment including : deportation , internal exile , internment in forced labour camps and prisonssometimes for lifeas well as extrajudicial killing . Nevertheless , Romanian anti-communist resistance movement anti-Communist resistance was one of the most long-lasting in the Eastern Bloc . A Presidential Commission for the Study of the Communist Dictatorship in Romania estimated the number of direct victims of the Communist repression at two million people .
In 1965 , Nicolae Ceauescu came to power and started to conduct the country 's foreign policy more independently from the Soviet Union . Thus , Communist Romania was the only Warsaw Pact country which refused to participate in the Soviet-led Warsaw Pact invasion of Czechoslovakia of Czechoslovakia . Ceauescu even Ceauescu 's speech of 21 August 1968 as `` a big mistake , [ and ] a serious danger to peace in Europe and to the fate of Communism in the world '' . ) It was the only Communist state to maintain diplomatic relations with Israel after 1967 's Six-Day War and established diplomatic relations with West Germany the same year . At the same time , close ties with the Arab world and the Palestine Liberation Organization ( PLO ) allowed Romania to play a key role in the IsraelEgypt and IsraelPLO peace talks .
As Romania 's foreign debt increased sharply between 1977 and 1981 ( from US $ 3 ; billion to $ 10 ; billion ) , the influence of international financial organisationssuch as the International Monetary Fund ( IMF ) and the World Bankgrew , gradually conflicting with Ceauescu 's autocracy rule . He eventually initiated a policy of total reimbursement of the foreign debt by imposing 1980s austerity policy in Romania that impoverished the population and exhausted the economy . The process succeeded in repaying all of Romania 's foreign government debt in 1989 . At the same time , Ceauescu greatly extended the authority of the Securitate secret police and imposed a severe Nicolae Ceauescu 's cult of personality , which led to a dramatic decrease in the dictator 's popularity and culminated in his overthrow and eventual execution , together with his wife , in the violent Romanian Revolution of December 1989 in which thousands were killed or injured . The charges for which they were executed were , among others , genocide by starvation .
===Contemporary period===
After the 1989 revolution , the National Salvation Front ( Romania ) ( NSF ) , led by Ion Iliescu , took partial multi-party democratic and free market measures . In April 1990 , a sit-in protest contesting the results of 1990 Romanian general election that year 's legislative elections and accusing the NSF , including Iliescu , of being made up of former Communists and members of the Securitate grew rapidly to become what was called the Golaniad . Peaceful demonstrations degenerated into violence , prompting the intervention of coal miners summoned by Iliescu . This episode has been documented widely by both local and foreign media , and is remembered as the June 1990 Mineriad .
The subsequent disintegration of the Front produced several political parties , including most notably the Social Democratic Party ( Romania ) ( PDSR then PSD ) and the Democratic Party ( Romania ) ( PD and subsequently PDL ) . The former governed Romania from 1990 until 1996 through several coalitions and governments , with Ion Iliescu as head of state . Since then , there have been several other democratic changes of government : in 1996 Emil Constantinescu was elected president , in 2000 Iliescu returned to power , while Traian Bsescu was elected in 2004 and narrowly re-elected in 2009.
In November 2014 , Sibiu ( Hermannstadt ) former Democratic Forum of Germans in Romania FDGR/DFDR mayor Klaus Iohannis was elected president , unexpectedly defeating former Prime Minister of Romania Victor Ponta , who had been previously leading in the opinion polls . This surprise victory was attributed by many analysts to the implication of the Romanian diaspora in the voting process , with almost 50 % casting ballots for Klaus Iohannis in the first round , compared to only 16 % for Ponta . In 2019 , Iohannis was re-elected president in a landslide victory over former Prime Minister Viorica Dncil .
The post1989 period is also characterised by the fact that most of the former industrial and economic enterprises which were built and operated during the Communist period were closed , mainly as a result of the policies of privatisation of the post1989 regimes .

Maldives ( , ;  translit=Dhivehi Raajje ) , officially the Republic of Maldives , is a small archipelagic state in South Asia , situated in the Arabian Sea of the Indian Ocean . It lies southwest of Sri Lanka and India , about from the Asian continent 's mainland . The chain of atolls of the Maldives stretches from Atolls of the Maldives # Ihavandhippolhu in the north to Addu Atoll in the south ( across the Equator ) . Comprising a territory spanning roughly , Maldives is one of the world 's most geographically dispersed sovereign states as well as the List of sovereign states and dependent territories in Asia by land area and , with around 557,426 inhabitants , the 2nd List of Asian countries by population . Mal is the capital and the most populated city , traditionally called the `` King 's Island '' where the ancient list of sultans of the Maldives ruled for its central location .
The Maldivian Archipelago is located on the Chagos-Laccadive Ridge , a vast submarine mountain range in the Indian Ocean ; this also forms a Ecoregion # Terrestrial , together with the Chagos Archipelago and Lakshadweep . With an average ground-level elevation of above sea level , it is the world 's lowest-lying country , with even its List of elevation extremes by country being one of the lowest in the world , at .
In the 12th century Islam reached the Maldivian Archipelago , which was consolidated as a list of sultans of the Maldives , developing strong commercial and cultural ties with Asia and Africa . From the mid-16th-century the region came under the increasing influence of European colonialism , with Maldives becoming a British protectorate in 1887 . History of the Maldives # Independence from the United Kingdom came in 1965 , and a presidential system was established in 1968 with an elected People 's Majlis . The ensuing decades have seen political instability , efforts at democratic reform , and environmental challenges posed by Global warming .
Maldives became a founding member of the South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation ( SAARC ) . It is also a member of the United Nations , the Commonwealth of Nations , the Organisation of Islamic Cooperation , and the Non-Aligned Movement . The World Bank classifies the Maldives as having an upper-Middle class economy . Fishing industry in the Maldives has historically been the dominant economic activity , and remains the largest sector by far , followed by the rapidly growing Tourism in the Maldives industry . Maldives rate `` high '' on the Human Development Index , with per-capita income significantly higher than other SAARC nations .
Maldives was a member of the Commonwealth of Nations from July 1982 until withdrawing from the organisation in October 2016 in protest at allegations by the other nations of its [ rights ] abuses and failing democracy . The Maldives rejoined the Commonwealth on 1 February 2020 after showing evidence of functioning democratic processes and popular support .
==Toponymy==
According to legends , the first settlers of Maldives were people known as Dheyvis . The first Kingdom of the Maldives was known as Dheeva Maari . In the 3rd century BC during the visit of emissaries sent by Emperor Asoka , Maldives was known as Dheeva Mahal .
During c. 1100 - 1166 , Maldives was also referred as Diva Kudha and the Laccadive archipelago which was a part of Maldives was then referred to as Diva Khanbar by the scholar and polymath al-Biruni ( 973-1048 ) .
The name Maldives may also derive from Sanskrit ml ( garland ) and dvpa ( island ) , or   Maala Divaina ( `` Necklace Islands '' ) in Sinhala language . The Maldivian people are called Dhivehin . The word Dheeb/Deeb ( archaic Dhivehi , related to Sanskrit  , dvpa ) means `` island '' , and Dhives ( Dhivehin ) means `` islanders '' ( i.e. , Maldivians ) .
The ancient Sri Lankan chronicle Mahawamsa refers to an island called Mahiladiva ( `` Island of Women '' ,  ) in Pali , which is probably a mistranslation of the same Sanskrit word meaning `` garland '' .
Jan Hogendorn , Grossman Professor of Economics , theorises that the name Maldives derives from the Sanskrit mldvpa (  ) , meaning `` garland of islands '' . In Tamil , `` Garland of Islands '' can be translated as Malai Theevu (  ) . In Malayalam , `` Garland of Islands '' can be translated as Maladweepu (  ) . In Kannada , `` Garland of Islands '' can be translated as Maaledweepa (  ) . None of these names is mentioned in any literature , but classical Sanskrit texts dating back to the Vedic period mention the `` Hundred Thousand Islands '' ( Lakshadweepa ) , a generic name which would include not only the Maldives , but also the Laccadives , Aminidivi Islands , Minicoy , and the Chagos Archipelago groups .
Some medieval travellers such as Ibn Battuta called the islands Mahal Dibiyat (   ) from the Arabic language word mahal ( `` palace '' ) , which must be how the Berber people traveller interpreted the local name , having been through Muslim North India , where Perso-Arabic words were introduced to the local vocabulary . This is the name currently inscribed on the scroll in the Emblem of Maldives . The classical Persian/Arabic name for Maldives is Dibajat . The Dutch referred to the islands as the Maldivische Eilanden ( ) , while the British anglicisation the local name for the islands first to the `` Maldive Islands '' and later to `` Maldives '' .
Garcia da Orta , in a conversational book first published in 1563 , writes as follows : `` I must tell you that I have heard it said that the natives do not call it Maldiva but Nalediva . In the Malabar language nale means four and diva island . So that in that language the word signifies `` four islands , '' while we , corrupting the name , call it Maldiva . ''
==History==
===Ancient history and settlement===
The Maldives is an old nation , well over 2,500 years old according to legends of the southern atolls .
According to the book `` Kitb fi thr Mdhu al-qdimah (      ) ( `` On the Ancient Ruins of Meedhoo ( Addu ) '' ) '' written in the 17th century in Arabic by Allama Ahmed Shihabuddine ( Allama Shihab al-Din ) of Meedhoo ( Addu ) in Addu Atoll , the first settlers of the Maldives were people known as Dheyvis . They came from the Kalibangan in India . The time of their arrival is unknown but it was before Emperor Ashoka 's kingdom in 269-232 BC . Shihabuddine 's story tallies remarkably well with the recorded history of South Asia and that of copperplate document of Maldives known as Lmfnu .
The Maapanansa , the copper plates on which was recorded the history of the first List of sultans of the Maldives from the Solar Dynasty , were lost quite early on .
A 4th-century notice written by Ammianus Marcellinus ( 362 AD ) speaks of gifts sent to the Roman emperor Julian ( emperor ) by a deputation from the nation of Divi . The name Divi is very similar to Dheyvi who were the first settlers of Maldives .
The ancient history of Maldives is told in copperplates , ancients scripts carved on coral artifacts , traditions , language and different ethnicities of Maldivians .
The first Maldivians did not leave any archaeological artifacts . Their buildings were probably built of wood , palm fronds , and other perishable materials , which would have quickly decayed in the salt and wind of the tropical climate . Moreover , chiefs or headmen did not reside in elaborate stone palaces , nor did their religion require the construction of large temples or compounds .
Comparative studies of Maldivian oral , linguistic , and cultural traditions confirm that the first settlers were people from the southern shores of the neighboring Indian subcontinent , including the Giraavaru people , mentioned in ancient legends and local folklore about the establishment of the capital and kingly rule in Mal .
A strong underlying layer of Dravidian peoples population and culture survives in Maldivian society , with a clear TamilKannada languages Tamil-Malayalam substratum in the language , which also appears in place names , kinship terms , poetry , dance , and religious beliefs . Malabar region and Pandyan seafaring culture led to the settlement of the Islands by Tamils and Malabars seafarers .
The Maldive Islands were mentioned in Ancient Sangam Tamil Literature as `` Munneer Pazhantheevam '' or `` Older Islands of Three Seas '' .
===Buddhist period===
Despite being just mentioned briefly in most history books , the 1,400-year-long Buddhist period has foundational importance in the history of the Maldives . It was during this period that the culture of the Maldives both developed and flourished , a culture which survives today . The Maldivian Dhivehi language , early Maldive Dhivehi Writing Systems , architecture , ruling institutions , customs , and manners of the Maldivians originated at the time when the Maldives were a Buddhist kingdom .
Buddhism probably spread to the Maldives in the 3rd century BC at the time of Emperor Ashoka 's expansion and became the dominant religion of the people of the Maldives until the 12th century AD . The ancient Maldivian Kings promoted Buddhism , and the first Maldive writings and artistic achievements , in the form of highly developed sculpture and architecture , originate from that period . Nearly all archaeological remains in the Maldives are from Buddhist stupas and monasteries , and all artifacts found to date display characteristic Buddhist iconography .
Buddhist ( and Hindu ) temples were Mandala shaped . They are oriented according to the four cardinal points with the main gate facing east . Local historian Hassan Ahmed Maniku counted as many as 59 islands with Buddhist archaeological sites in a provisional list he published in 1990.
===Islamic period===
The importance of the Arabs as traders in the Indian Ocean by the 12th century may partly explain why the last Buddhist king of Maldives , Dhovemi of the Maldives , converted to Islam in the year 1153 ( or 1193 ) . Adopting the Muslim title of Sultan Muhammad ibn Abdullah , he initiated a series of six Islamic dynasties that lasted until 1932 when the sultanate became elective . The formal title of the sultan up to 1965 was , Sultan of Land and Sea , Lord of the twelve-thousand islands and Sultan of the Maldives which came with the style Highness .
Somalis Muslim Abu al-Barakat Yusuf al-Barbari , also known as Aw Barkhadle , is traditionally credited for this conversion . According to the story told to Ibn Battutah , a mosque was built with the inscription : 'The Sultan Ahmad Shanurazah accepted Islam at the hand of Abu al-Barakat Yusuf al-Barbari . ' Some scholars have suggested the possibility of Ibn Battuta misreading Maldive texts , and having a bias towards the North African , Maghrebi narrative of this Shaykh , instead of the East African origins account that was known as well at the time . Even when Ibn Battuta visited the islands , the governor of the island at that time was Abd al-Aziz of Mogadishu , a Somalis
Scholars have posited another scenario where Abu al-Barakat Yusuf al-Barbari might have been a native of Berbera , a significant trading port on the northwestern coast of Somalia . Barbara or Barbaroi ( Berbers ) , as the ancestors of the Somali people were referred to by medieval Arab people and ancient Greeks geographers , respectively . This is also seen when Ibn Battuta visited Mogadishu , he mentions that the Sultan at that time , `` Abu Bakr ibn Shaikh Omar '' , was a Berber ( Somali ) . According to scholars , Abu al-Barakat Yusuf al-Barbari was Yusuf bin Ahmad al-Kawneyn , a famous native Somalis scholar known for establishing the Walashma dynasty of the Horn of Africa . After his conversion of the population of Dogor ( now known as Aw Barkhadle ) , a town in Somalia , he is also credited to have been responsible for spreading Islam in the Maldivian islands , establishing the Mal Friday Mosque , and converting the Maldivian population to Islam . Ibn Battuta states the Maldivian king was converted by Abu al-Barakat Yusuf al-Barbari ( Blessed Father of Somalia ) .
Others have it he may have been from the Persian town of Tabriz . The first reference to an Iranian origin dates to an 18th-century Persian text .
His venerated tomb now stands on the grounds of Medhu Ziyaaraiy , across the street from the Friday Mosque , or Mal Friday Mosque , in Mal . Built in 1656 , this is the oldest mosque in Maldives . Following the Islamic concept that before Islam there was the time of Jahiliya ( ignorance ) , in the history books used by Maldivians the # Introduction of Islam at the end of the 12th century is considered the cornerstone of the country 's history . Nonetheless , the cultural influence of Buddhism remains , a reality directly experienced by Ibn Battuta during his nine months there sometime between 1341 and 1345 , serving as a chief judge and marrying into the royal family of Omar I of the Maldives . For he became embroiled in local politics and left when his strict judgments in the laissez-faire island kingdom began to chafe with its rulers . In particular , he was dismayed at the local women going about with no clothing above the waista violation of Middle Eastern Islamic standards of modestyand the locals taking no notice when he complained .
Compared to the other areas of South Asia , the conversion of the Maldives to Islam happened relatively late . Arab traders had converted populations in the Malabar Coast since the 7th century , and Muhammad bin Qasim had converted large swathes of Sindh to Islam at about the same time . The Maldives remained a Buddhist kingdom for another 500 years after the conversion of Malabar Coast and Sindhperhaps as the southwesternmost Buddhist country . Arabic became the prime language of administration ( instead of Persian and Urdu ) , and the Maliki school of jurisprudence was introduced , both hinting at direct contacts with the core of the Arab world .
Middle Eastern seafarers had just begun to take over the Indian Ocean trade routes in the 10th century and found Maldives to be an important link in those routes as the first landfall for traders from Basra sailing to Southeast Asia . Trade involved mainly cowrie shellswidely used as a form of currency throughout Asia and parts of the East African coastand coir fiber . The Bengal Sultanate , where cowrie shells were used as legal tender , was one of the principal trading partners of the Maldives . The BengalMaldives cowry shell trade was the largest shell currency trade network in history .
The other essential product of the Maldives was coir , the fibre of the dried coconut [ resistant to saltwater . It stitched together and rigged the dhow ] s that plied the Indian Ocean . Maldivian coir was exported to Sindh , [ [ China , Yemen , and the Persian Gulf .
===Colonial period===
In 1558 the Portuguese established a small garrison with a Viador ( Viyazoru ) , or overseer of a factory ( trading post ) in the Maldives , which they administered from their main colony in Goa . Their attempts to impose Christianity provoked a local revolt led by Muhammad Thakurufaanu Al Auzam Muhammad Thakurufaanu al-A'uam and his two brothers , that fifteen years later drove the Portuguese out of Maldives . This event is now commemorated as National Day .
In the mid-17th century , the Dutch , who had replaced the Portuguese as the dominant power in Ceylon , established hegemony over Maldivian affairs without involving themselves directly in local matters , which were governed according to centuries-old Islamic customs .
The British expelled the Dutch from Ceylon in 1796 and included Maldives as a British Protectorate . The status of Maldives as a British protectorate was officially recorded in an 1887 agreement in which the sultan accepted British influence over Maldivian external relations and defence while retaining home rule , which continued to be regulated by Muslim traditional institutions in exchange for an Maldivian annual tribute . The status of the islands was akin to other British protectorates in the Indian Ocean region , including Zanzibar and the Trucial States .
In the British period , the Sultan 's powers were taken over by the Chief Minister , much to the chagrin of the British Governor-General who continued to deal with the ineffectual Sultan . Consequently , Britain encouraged the development of a constitutional monarchy , and the first Constitution was proclaimed in 1932 . However , the new arrangements favoured neither the aging Sultan nor the wily Chief Minister , but rather a young crop of British-educated reformists . As a result , angry mobs were instigated against the Constitution which was publicly torn up .
Maldives remained a British crown protectorate until 1953 when the sultanate was suspended and the First Republic was declared under the short-lived presidency of Muhammad Amin Didi . While serving as prime minister during the 1940s , Didi nationalized the fish export industry . As president , he is remembered as a reformer of the education system and a promoter of women 's rights . Conservatives in Mal eventually ousted his government , and during a riot over food shortages , Didi was beaten by a mob and died on a nearby island .
Beginning in the 1950s , the political history in Maldives was largely influenced by the British military presence in the islands . In 1954 the restoration of the sultanate perpetuated the rule of the past . Two years later , the United Kingdom obtained permission to reestablish its wartime RAF Gan airfield in the southernmost Addu Atoll , employing hundreds of locals . In 1957 , however , the new prime minister , Ibrahim Nasir , called for a review of the agreement . Nasir was challenged in 1959 by a local secessionist movement in the three southernmost atolls that benefited economically from the British presence on Gan ( Seenu Atoll ) . This group cut ties with the Maldives government and formed an independent state , the United Suvadive Republic with Abdullah Afif as president and Hithadhoo ( Seenu Atoll ) as capital . One year later the Suvadive republic was scrapped after Nasir sent gunboats from Mal with government police , and Abdulla Afif went into exile . Meanwhile , in 1960 the Maldives had allowed the United Kingdom to continue to use both the RAF Gan and the Hitaddu facilities for a thirty-year period , with the payment of 750,000 over the period of 1960 to 1965 for the purpose of Maldives ' economic development . The base was closed in 1976 as part of the larger British withdrawal of permanently-stationed forces 'East of Suez ' .
===Independence and republic===
When the British became increasingly unable to continue their colonial hold on Asia and were losing their colonies to the indigenous populations who wanted freedom , on 26 July 1965 an agreement was signed on behalf of the Sultan by Ibrahim Nasir Rannabandeyri Kilegefan , Prime Minister , and on behalf of the British government by Sir Michael Walker , British Ambassador-designate to the Maldive Islands , which formally ended the British authority on the defence and external affairs of the Maldives . The islands thus achieved freedom , with the ceremony taking place at the British High Commissioner 's Residence in Colombo . After this , the sultanate continued for another three years under Muhammad Fareed Didi , who declared himself King upon independence .
On 15 November 1967 , a vote was taken in parliament to decide whether the Maldives should continue as a constitutional monarchy or become a republic . Of the 44 members of parliament , 40 voted in favour of a republic . On 15 March 1968 , a national referendum was held on the question , and 93.34 % of those taking part voted in favour of establishing a republic . The republic was declared on 11 November 1968 , thus ending the 853-year-old monarchy , which was replaced by a republic under the presidency of Ibrahim Nasir . As the King had held little real power , this was seen as a cosmetic change and required few alterations in the structures of government .
Tourism in the Maldives began to be developed on the archipelago by the beginning of the 1970s . The first resort in the Maldives was Kurumba Maldives which welcomed the first guests on 3 October 1972 . The first accurate census was held in December 1977 and showed 142,832 people living in the Maldives .
Political infighting during the 1970s between Nasir 's faction and other political figures led to the 1975 arrest and exile of elected prime minister Ahmed Zaki ( politician ) to a remote atoll . Economic decline followed the closure of the Gan International Airport and the collapse of the market for dried fish , an important export . With support for his administration faltering , Nasir fled to Singapore in 1978 , with millions of dollars from the treasury .
Maumoon Abdul Gayoom began his 30-year role as president in 1978 , winning six consecutive elections without opposition . His election was seen as ushering in a period of political stability and economic development in view of Maumoon 's priority to develop the poorer islands . Tourism flourished and increased foreign contact spurred development . However , Maumoon 's rule was controversial , with some critics saying Maumoon was an autocrat who quelled dissent by limiting freedoms and political favouritism .
A series of coup attempts ( in 1980 , 1983 , and 1988 ) by Nasir supporters and business interests tried to topple the government without success . While the first two attempts met with little success , the 1988 coup attempt involved a roughly 80 strong mercenary force of the People 's Liberation Organisation of Tamil Eelam who seized the airport and caused Maumoon to flee from house to house until the intervention of 1,600 Indian Armed Forces airlifted into Mal restored order .
The November 1988 coup was headed by Muhammadu Ibrahim Lutfee , a businessman . On the night of 3 November 1988 , the Indian Air Force airlifted a Parachute Regiment ( India ) # Operation Cactus from Agra and flew them over to the Maldives . The Indian paratroopers landed at Hulhul Island and secured the airfield and restored the government rule at Mal within hours . The brief operation , labelled Operation Cactus , also involved the Indian Navy .
===Twenty-first century===
On 26 December 2004 , following the 2004 Indian Ocean earthquake , the Effect of the 2004 Indian Ocean earthquake on the Maldives by a tsunami . Only nine islands were reported to have escaped any flooding , while fifty-seven islands faced serious damage to critical infrastructure , fourteen islands had to be totally evacuated , and six islands were destroyed . A further twenty-one resort islands were forced to close because of tsunami damage . The total damage was estimated at more than US $ 400 ; million , or some 62 % of the GDP . 102 Maldivians and 6 foreigners reportedly died in the tsunami . The destructive impact of the waves on the low-lying islands was mitigated by the fact there was no continental shelf or land mass upon which the waves could gain height . The tallest waves were reported to be high .
During the later part of Maumoon 's rule , independent political movements emerged in Maldives , which challenged the then-ruling Dhivehi Rayyithunge Party ( Maldivian People 's Party , MPP ) and demanded democratic reform . The dissident journalist and activist Mohamed Nasheed founded the Maldivian Democratic Party ( MDP ) in 2003 and pressured Maumoon into allowing gradual political reforms . In 2008 a new constitution was approved and the Maldivian presidential election , 2008 occurred , which were won by Nasheed in the second round . His administration faced many challenges , including the huge debt left by the previous government , the economic downturn following the 2004 tsunami , overspending by means of overprinting of local currency ( the rufiyaa ) , unemployment , corruption , and increasing drug use . Taxation on goods was imposed for the first time in the country , and import duties were reduced in many goods and services . Social welfare benefits were given to those aged 65 years or older , single parents , and those with special needs .
Social and 201112 Maldives political crisis , following opposition campaigns in the name of protecting Islam . Nasheed controversially resigned from office after large number of police and army mutinied in February 2012 . Nasheed 's vice president , Mohammed Waheed Hassan , was sworn in as president .
Nasheed was later arrested , convicted of terrorism , and sentenced to 13 years . The trial was widely seen as flawed and political . The UN Working Group on Arbitrary Detention called for Nasheed 's immediate release .
The Maldivian presidential election , 2013 were highly contested . Former president Nasheed won the most votes in the first round , but the Supreme Court annulled it despite the positive assessment of international election observers . In the re-run vote Abdulla Yameen , half-brother of the former president Maumoon , assumed the presidency . Yameen introduced increased engagement with China , and promoted a policy of connecting Islam with anti-Western rhetoric . Yameen survived an assassination attempt in late 2015 . Vice president Ahmed Adeeb was later arrested together with 17 supporters for `` public order offences '' and the government instituted a broader crackdown against political dissent . A state of emergency was later declared ahead of a planned anti-government rally , and the people 's Majlis accelerated the removal of Adeeb .
In the 2018 elections Ibrahim Mohamed Solih won the most votes , and became President .
Adeeb was freed by courts in Male in July 2019 after his conviction on charges of terrorism and corruption was overruled , but was placed under a travel ban after the state prosecutor appealed the order in a corruption and money laundering case . Adeeb escaped in a tugboat to seek asylum in India . It is understood that the Indian Coast Guard escorted the tugboat to the International Maritime Boundary Line ( IMBL ) and he was then  transferred  to a Maldivian Coast Guard ship , where officials took him into custody .
==Geography==
The Maldives consists of 1,192 coral islands grouped in a double chain of 26 atolls , that stretch along a length of north to south , east to west , spread over roughly , of which only is dry land , making this one of the world 's most dispersed countries . It lies between latitudes 1st parallel south 1S and 8th parallel north 8N , and longitudes 72nd meridian east 72 and 74th meridian east 74E . The atolls are composed of live coral reefs and sand bars , situated atop a submarine ridge long that rises abruptly from the depths of the Indian Ocean and runs north to south .
Only near the southern end of this natural coral barricade do two open passages permit safe ship navigation from one side of the Indian Ocean to the other through the territorial waters of Maldives . For administrative purposes , the Maldivian government organised these atolls into 21 Administrative divisions of the Maldives . The largest island of Maldives is that of Gan ( Laamu Atoll ) , which belongs to Laamu Atoll or Hahdhummathi Maldives . In Addu Atoll , the westernmost islands are connected by roads over the reef ( collectively called Link Road ) and the total length of the road is .
Maldives is the lowest country in the world , with maximum and average natural ground levels of only and above sea level , respectively . In areas where construction exists , however , this has been increased to several metres . More than 80 per cent of the country 's land is composed of coral islands which rise less than one metre above sea level . As a result , the Maldives are at high risk of being submerged due to Sea level rise . The IPCC UN 's environmental panel has warned that , at current rates , sea-level rise would be high enough to make the Maldives uninhabitable by 2100.
===Climate===
The Maldives has a tropical monsoon climate ( Am ) under the Kppen climate classification , which is affected by the large landmass of South Asia to the north . Because the Maldives has the lowest elevation of any country in the world , the temperature is constantly hot and often humid . The presence of this landmass causes differential heating of land and water . These factors set off a rush of moisture-rich air from the Indian Ocean over South Asia , resulting in the southwest monsoon . Two seasons dominate Maldives ' weather : the dry season associated with the winter northeastern monsoon and the rainy season associated with the southwest monsoon which brings strong winds and storms .
The shift from the dry northeast monsoon to the moist southwest monsoon occurs during April and May . During this period , the southwest winds contribute to the formation of the southwest monsoon , which reaches Maldives at the beginning of June and lasts until the end of November . However , the weather patterns of Maldives do not always conform to the monsoon patterns of South Asia . The annual rainfall averages in the north and in the south .
The monsoonal influence is greater in the north of the Maldives than in the south , more influenced by the Equatorial Counter Current .
The average high temperature is 31.5 degree Celsius and the average low temperature is 26.4 degree Celsius .
===Sea level rise===
The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change 's 2007 report predicted the upper limit of the sea level rises will be by 2100 , which means that most of the republic 's 200 inhabited islands may need to be abandoned . According to researchers from the University of Southampton , the Maldives are the third most endangered island nation due to flooding from climate change as a percentage of population .
Former president Mohamed Nasheed has been highly outspoken about this issue , saying in 2012 that `` If carbon emissions continue at the rate they are climbing today , my country will be under water in seven years . '' He has called for more climate change mitigation action while on the American television shows The Daily Show and the Late Show with David Letterman , and hosted `` the world 's first underwater cabinet meeting '' in 2009 to raise awareness of the threats posed by climate change . Concerns over sea level rise have also been expressed by Nasheed 's predecessor , Maumoon Abdul Gayoom .
In 2008 , Nasheed announced plans to look into purchasing new land in India , Sri Lanka , and Australia because of his concerns about global warming , and the possibility of much of the islands being inundated with water from rising sea levels . The purchase of land will be made from a fund generated by tourism . The president explained his intentions : `` We do not want to leave the Maldives , but we also do not want to be climate refugees living in tents for decades '' .
By 2020 , Maldives plans to eliminate or offset all of its greenhouse gas emissions . At the 2009 International Climate Talks , Nasheed explained that : For us swearing off fossil fuels is not only the right thing to do , it is in our economic self-interest ... Pioneering countries will free themselves from the unpredictable price of foreign oil ; they will capitalise on the new green economy of the future , and they will enhance their moral standing giving them greater political influence on the world stage .
In 2020 , a three-year study at the University of Plymouth found that as tides move sediment to create higher elevation , the islands , and also Tuvalu and Kiribati , may rise instead of sink .
===Environment===
Environmental issues other than sea level rise include bad waste disposal and beach theft . Although the Maldives are kept relatively pristine and little litter can be found on the islands , no good Waste management sites exist . Most trash from Mal and other resorts is simply dumped at Thilafushi .
List of Protected Areas of Maldives are administered by the Ministry of Environment and Energy and Environmental Protection Agency ( EPA ) of the Maldives .
===Marine ecosystem===
The Maldives have a range of different habitats including deep sea , shallow coast , and reef ecosystems , fringing mangroves , wetlands and dry land . There are 187 species of coral forming the coral reefs . This area of the Indian Ocean , alone , houses 1,100 species of fish , 5 species of sea turtle , 21 species of whale and dolphin , 400 species of mollusc , and 83 species of echinoderms . The area is also populated by a number of crustacean species : 120 copepods , 15 amphipods , as well as more than 145 crab and 48 shrimp species .
Among the many marine families represented are pufferfish , Caesionidae , Carangidae , lionfish , oriental sweetlips , reef sharks , groupers , eels , Lutjanidae , bannerfish , Ogcocephalidae , [ wrasse ] , spotted eagle rays , scorpionfish , lobsters , nudibranches , Pomacanthidae , butterflyfish , squirrelfish , soldierfish , Asiatic glassfish , surgeonfish , Naso ( fish ) , triggerfish , Napoleon wrasse , and barracuda .
These coral reefs are home to a variety of marine ecosystems that vary from planktonic organisms to whale sharks . Sponges have gained importance as five species have displayed anti-tumor and anti-cancer properties .
In 1998 , sea-temperature warming of as much as due to a single El Nio-Southern Oscillation event caused coral bleaching , killing two-thirds of the nation 's coral reefs .
In an effort to induce the regrowth of the reefs , scientists placed electrified cones anywhere from below the surface to provide a substrate for larval coral attachment . In 2004 , scientists witnessed corals regenerating . Corals began to eject pink-orange eggs and sperm . The growth of these electrified corals was five times faster than untreated corals . Scientist Azeez Hakim stated :
Again , in 2016 , the coral reefs of the Maldives experienced a Coral bleaching # Maldives . Up to 95 % of coral around some islands have died , and , even after six months , 100 % of young coral transplants died . The surface water temperatures reached an all-time high in 2016 , at 31 degrees Celsius in May .
Recent scientific studies suggest that the faunistic composition can vary greatly between neighbour atolls , especially in terms of benthic fauna . Differences in terms of fishing pressure ( including poaching ) could be the cause .
==Government==
Maldives is a presidential system republic , with extensive influence of the president as [ of government ] and [ of state ] . The president heads the Executive ( government ) , and appoints the Cabinet of the Maldives which is approved by the Majlis of the Maldives People 's Majlis ( Parliament ) . He leads the Maldives National Defence Force . There is no separation of powers . The current president as of 17 November 2018 is Ibrahim Mohamed Solih . Members of the Unicameralism Majlis serve five-year terms , with the total number of members determined by atoll populations . At the Maldivian parliamentary election , 2014 , 77 members were elected . The People 's Majlis , located in Mal , houses members from all over the country .
The republican constitution came into force in 1968 , and was amended in 1970 , 1972 , and 1975 . On 27 November 1997 it was replaced by another Constitution assented to by then-President Maumoon Abdul Gayoom . This Constitution came into force on 1 January 1998 . The current Constitution of Maldives was ratified by President Maumoon on 7 August 2008 , and came into effect immediately , replacing and repealing the constitution of 1998 . This new constitution includes a judiciary run by an independent commission , and independent commissions to oversee elections and fight corruption . It also reduces the executive powers vested under the president and strengthens the parliament . All state that the President of the Maldives is head of state , head of government and Commander-in-Chief of the Maldives National Defence Force of the Maldives .
In 2018 , the ruling Progressive Party of Maldives ( PPM-Y ) 's tensions with opposition parties and subsequent crackdown was termed as an `` assault on democracy '' by the United Nations Human Rights Council chief .
===Law===
According to the Constitution of Maldives , `` the judges are independent , and subject only to the Constitution and the law . When deciding matters on which the Constitution or the law is silent , judges must consider Islamic Sharia Shari'ah '' .
Islam is the official religion of the Maldives and open practice of any other religion is forbidden . The 2008 constitution says that the republic `` is based on the principles of Islam '' and that `` no law contrary to any principle of Islam can be applied '' . Non-Muslims are prohibited from becoming citizens .
The requirement to adhere to a particular religion and prohibition of public worship following other religions is contrary to Article 18 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and Article 18 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights to which Maldives has recently become party and was addressed in Maldives ' reservation in adhering to the Covenant claiming that `` The application of the principles set out in Article 18 of the Covenant shall be without prejudice to the Constitution of the Republic of the Maldives . ''
A new Criminal code came into effect on July 16 , 2015 , replacing the 1968 law , the first modern , comprehensive penal code to incorporate the major tenets and principles of Islamic law .
Homosexuality Same-sex relations are illegal in the Maldives , although tourist resorts typically operate as exceptions to this law .
===Foreign relations===
Since 1996 , the Maldives has been the official progress monitor of the Indian Ocean Commission . In 2002 , the Maldives began to express interest in the commission but had not applied for membership . Maldives ' interest relates to its identity as a small island state , especially economic development and environmental preservation , and its desire for closer relations with France , a main actor in the IOC region .
The Maldives is a founding member of the South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation ( South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation ) . The republic joined the Commonwealth of Nations in 1982 , some 17 years after gaining independence from the United Kingdom . In October 2016 , Maldives announced its withdrawal from the Commonwealth in protest at allegations of human rights abuse and failing democracy . The Maldives enjoys close ties with Commonwealth members Seychelles and Mauritius . The Maldives and Comoros are also both members of the Organisation of Islamic Cooperation . Following his election as president in 2018 , Ibrahim Mohamed Solih and his Cabinet decided that the Maldives would apply to rejoin the Commonwealth , with readmission occurring on 1 February 2020.
===Military===
The Maldives National Defence Force is the combined security organisation responsible for defending the security and sovereignty of the Maldives , having the primary task of being responsible for attending to all internal and external security needs of the Maldives , including the protection of the Exclusive Economic Zone ( EEZ ) and the maintenance of peace and security . The MNDF component branches are the Coast Guard , Marine Corps , Special Forces , Service Corps , and the Corps of Engineers .
As a water-bound nation , much of its security concerns lie at sea . Almost 99 % of the country is covered by sea and the remaining 1 % land is scattered over an area of  , with the largest island being not more than . Therefore , the duties assigned to the MNDF of maintaining surveillance over Maldives ' waters and providing protection against foreign intruders poaching in the EEZ and territorial waters , are immense tasks from both logistical and economic viewpoints . In 2019 , Maldives signed the UN treaty on the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons .
The Coast Guard plays a vital role in carrying out these functions . To provide timely security its patrol boats are stationed at various MNDF Regional Headquarters . The Coast Guard is also assigned to respond to the maritime distress calls and to conduct search and rescue operations in a timely manner . Maritime pollution control exercises are conducted regularly on an annual basis for familiarisation and handling of such hazardous situations .
===Human rights===
Human rights in the Maldives is a contentious issue . In its 2011 Freedom in the World report , Freedom House declared the Maldives `` Partly Free '' , claiming a reform process which had made headway in 2009 and 2010 had stalled . The Bureau of Democracy , Human Rights and Labor United States Bureau of Democracy , Human Rights and Labor claims in their 2012 report on human rights practices in the country that the most significant problems are corruption , lack of Freedom of religion , and abuse and unequal treatment of women .
===Administrative divisions===
The Maldives has twenty-six natural Atolls of the Maldives and few island groups on isolated reefs , all of which have been divided into twenty-one administrative divisions ( 17 administrative atolls and cities of Mal , Addu City , Fuvahmulah and Kulhudhuffushi ) .
Each atoll is administered by an elected Atoll Council . The islands are administered by an elected Island Council .
In addition to a name , every administrative division is identified by the Maldivian code letters , such as `` Haa Alif '' for Northern Thiladhunmathi Atoll ( Thiladhunmathi North ) ; and by a Latin code letter . The first corresponds to the geographical Maldivian name of the atoll ; the second is a code adopted for convenience . As there are certain islands in different atolls that have the same name , for administrative purposes this code is quoted before the name of the island , for example : Baa Funadhoo , Kaafu Funadhoo , Gaafu-Alifu Funadhoo . Since most atolls have very long geographical names it is also used whenever the long name is inconvenient , for example in the atoll website names .
The introduction of code-letter names has been a source of much puzzlement and misunderstandings , especially among foreigners . Many people have come to think that the code-letter of the administrative atoll is its new name and that it has replaced its geographical name . Under such circumstances it is hard to know which is the correct name to use .
==Economy==
Historically , the Maldives provided enormous quantities of cowry shells , [ of money an international currency of the early ages ] . From the 2nd century AD , the islands were known as the 'Money Isles ' by the Arabs . Monetaria moneta were used for centuries as a currency in Africa , and huge amounts of Maldive Islands cowries were introduced into Africa by western nations during the period of slave trade . The cowry is now the symbol of the Maldives Monetary Authority .
In the early 1970s , the Maldives was one of the world 's 20 poorest countries , with a population of 100,000 . The economy at the time was largely dependent on fisheries and trading local goods such as coir rope , ambergris ( Maavaharu ) , and coco de mer ( Tavakkaashi ) with neighboring countries and East Asian countries .
The Maldivian government began a largely successful economic reform programme in the 1980s , initiated by lifting import quotas and giving more opportunities to the private sector . At the time tourism sector which would play a significant role in the nation 's development was at its infant stage .
Agriculture and manufacturing continue to play lesser roles in the economy , constrained by the limited availability of cultivable land and the shortage of domestic labour .
===Tourism===
The Maldives remained largely unknown to tourists until the early 1970s . Only 189 islands are home to its 447,137 inhabitants . The other islands are used entirely for economic purposes , of which tourism and agriculture are the most dominant . Tourism accounts for 28 % of the GDP and more than 60 % of the Maldives ' foreign exchange receipts . Over 90 % of government tax revenue comes from import duties and tourism-related taxes .
The development of tourism fostered the overall growth of the Economy of the Maldives country 's economy . It created direct and indirect employment and income generation opportunities in other related industries . The first tourist resorts were opened in 1972 with Bandos Island Resort and Kurumba Village ( the current name is Kurumba Maldives ) , which transformed the Maldives economy .
According to the Ministry of Tourism ( Maldives ) , the emergence of tourism in 1972 transformed the economy , moving rapidly from dependence on fisheries to tourism . In just three and a half decades , the industry became the main source of income . Tourism was also the country 's biggest foreign currency earner and the single largest contributor to the GDP . , 89 resorts in the Maldives offered over 17,000 beds and hosted over 600,000 tourists annually . In 2019 over 1.7 million visitors came to the islands .
The number of resorts increased from 2 to 92 between 1972 and 2007. , over 8,380,000 tourists had visited Maldives .
The country has List of mosques in the Maldives listed as UNESCO tentative sites .
====Visitors====
Visitors to the Maldives do not need to apply for a visa pre-arrival , regardless of their country of origin , provided they have a valid passport , proof of onward travel , and the money to be self-sufficient while in the country .
Most visitors arrive at Velana International Airport , on Hulhul Island , adjacent to the capital Mal . The airport is served by flights to and from India , Sri Lanka , Doha , Dubai , Singapore , Istanbul , and major airports in South-East Asia , as well as charters from Europe . Gan International Airport , on the southern atoll of Addu City , also serves an international flight to Milan several times a week . British Airways offers direct flights to the Maldives around 23 times per week .
===Fishing industry===
For many centuries the Maldivian economy was entirely dependent on fishing and other ocean products . Fishing remains the main occupation of the people and the government gives priority to the fisheries sector .
The mechanisation of the traditional fishing boat called Dhoni ( fishing vessel ) in 1974 was a major milestone in the development of the fisheries industry . A fish canning plant was installed on Felivaru in 1977 , as a joint venture with a Japanese firm . In 1979 , a Fisheries Advisory Board was set up with the mandate of advising the government on policy guidelines for the overall development of the fisheries sector . Manpower development programmes began in the early 1980s , and fisheries education was incorporated into the school curriculum . Fish aggregating devices and navigational aids were located at various strategic points . Moreover , the opening up of the exclusive economic zone ( EEZ ) of the Maldives for fisheries has further enhanced the growth of the fisheries sector .
, fisheries contributed over 15 % of the country 's GDP and engaged about 30 % of the country 's workforce . Fisheries were also the second-largest foreign exchange earner after # Tourism .

The largest ethnic group is Dhivehis , i.e . the Maldivians , native to the historic region of the Maldive Islands comprising today 's Republic of Maldives and the island of Minicoy in Lakshadweep , India . They share the same culture and speak the Dhivehi language . They are principally an Indo-Aryan peoples Indo-Aryan people , having traces of Middle Eastern , South Asian , Austronesian peoples and African genes in the population .
In the past , there was also a small Tamils population known as the Giraavaru people . This group have now been almost completely absorbed into the larger Maldivian society but were once native to the island of Giraavaru ( Kaafu Atoll ) . This island was evacuated in 1968 due to heavy erosion of the island .
Some social stratification exists on the islands . It is not rigid , since rank is based on varied factors , including occupation , wealth , Islamic virtue , and family ties . Instead of a complex caste system , there was merely a distinction between noble ( bfulhu ) and common people in the Maldives . Members of the social elite are concentrated in Mal .
The population doubled by 1978 , and the population growth rate peaked at 3.4 % in 1985 . At the 2006 census , the population had reached 298,968 , although the census in 2000 showed that the population growth rate had declined to 1.9 % . Life expectancy at birth stood at 46 years in 1978 , and later rose to 72 . Infant mortality has declined from 12.7 % in 1977 to 1.2 % today , and adult literacy reached 99 % . Combined school enrolment reached the high 90s . The population was projected to have reached 317,280 in 2010.
The 2014 Population and Housing Census listed the total population in Maldives as 437,535 : 339,761 resident Maldivians and 97,774 resident foreigners , approximately 16 % of the total population . However , it is believed that foreigners have been undercounted . there are 177,585 expatriate workers , out of which 63,000 are estimated to be undocumented in the Maldives : 3,045 Chinese , 3,544 Nepalese , 14,311 Sri Lankans , 24,379 Indians , and 112,158 Bangladeshis in the Maldives , making them the largest group of foreigners working in the country . Other immigrants include Filipinos in the Maldives as well as various Western foreign workers .
===Religion===
After the long Buddhism in the Maldives , Muslim traders introduced Islam . Maldivians converted to Islam by the mid-12th century . The islands have had a long history of Sufic orders , as can be seen in the history of the country such as the building of tombs . They were used until as recently as the 1980s for seeking the help of buried saints . They can be seen next to some old mosques and are considered a part of Maldives 's cultural heritage .
Other aspects of tassawuf , such as ritualised dhikr ceremonies called Mauldu ( Mawlid ) the liturgy of which included recitations and certain supplications in a melodic toneexisted until very recent times . These Mauldu festivals were held in ornate tents specially built for the occasion . At present Islam is the official religion of the entire population , as adherence to it is required for citizenship .
According to Moroccan traveller Ibn Battuta , the person responsible for this conversion was a Sunni Muslim visitor named Abu al-Barakat Yusuf al-Barbari , sailing from Morocco . He is also referred to as Tabrizugefaanu . His venerated tomb now stands on the grounds of Medhu Ziyaaraiy , across the street from the Friday Mosque , or Mal Friday Mosque , in Mal . Built in 1656 , this is the country 's oldest mosque .
===Languages===
The official and common language is Dhivehi language , an Indo-Aryan languages Indo-Aryan language closely related to the Sinhala language of Sri Lanka . The first known script used to write Dhivehi is the eveyla akuru script , which is found in historical recording of kings ( raadhavalhi ) . Later a script called dhives akuru was used for a long period . The present-day script is called Thaana and is written from right to left . Thaana is said to have been introduced by the reign of Muhammad Thakurufaanu Al Auzam .
English is widely spoken by the locals of the Maldives . Following the nation 's opening to the outside world , the introduction of English as a medium of instruction at secondary and tertiary level of education , and its government 's recognition of the opportunities offered through tourism , English has now firmly established itself in the country . As such , the Maldives are quite similar to the countries in the Gulf region ( cf . Randall & Samimi , 2010 ; Boyle , 2012 ) . The nation is undergoing vast societal change , and English is part of this .
===Population by locality===
==Culture==
The culture of the Maldives is influenced by the cultures of the people of different ethnicities who have settled on the islands throughout the times .
Since the 12th century AD , there were also influences from Arabia in the language and culture of the Maldives because of the conversion to Islam and its location as a crossroads in the central Indian Ocean . This was due to the long trading history between the far east and the middle east .
Reflective of this is the fact that the Maldives has had the highest national divorce rate in the world for many decades . This , it is hypothesised , is due to a combination of liberal Islamic rules about divorce and the relatively loose marital bonds that have been identified as common in non- and semi-sedentary peoples without a history of fully developed agrarian property and kinship relations .
==Transportation==
Velana International Airport is the principal gateway to the Maldives ; it is near the capital city Mal and is surrounded by water . International travel is available on government-owned Island Aviation Services ( branded as Maldivian ) , which operates to nearly all Maldives domestic airports with several Bombardier Dash 8 aircraft , and one A320 with international service to India , Bangladesh , China , and Thailand .
In Maldives , there are three main ways to travel between islands : by domestic flight , by seaplane , or by boat . For several years there were two seaplane companies operating : TMA ( Trans Maldivian Airways ) and Maldivian Air Taxi , but these merged in 2013 under the name TMA . The seaplane fleet is entirely made up of DHC-6 Twin Otters . There is also another airline , Flyme ( Villa Air ) , which operates using ATR ( aircraft manufacturer ) planes to domestic airports , principally Villa International Airport , Dharavandhoo Airport and some others . Manta Air begins its first scheduled seaplane service . Its seaplane fleet is made up of DHC-6 Twin Otter aircraft . In addition to the seaplane service , Manta Air utilizes ATR ( aircraft manufacturer ) ATR 72-600 aircraft to operate domestic flights to Dhaalu Airport , Dharavandhoo Airport and Kooddoo Airport from the main Velana International Airport . Depending on the distance of the destination island from the airport , resorts organise speedboat transfers or seaplane flights directly to the resort island jetty for their guests . Several daily flights operate from Velana International Airport to the 12 domestic and international airports in the country . Scheduled ferries also operate from Mal to many of the atolls . The traditional Maldivian boat is called a Dhoni ( fishing vessel ) . Speedboats and seaplanes tend to be more expensive , while travel by dhoni , although slower , is relatively cheaper and convenient .
==Education==
The Maldives National University is one of the country 's three institutions of higher education . Its mission statement is as follows :
To create , discover , preserve and disseminate knowledge that is necessary to enhance the lives and livelihoods of people and essential for the cultural , social and economic development of the society so that this nation shall remain free and Islamic forever .
In 1973 , the Allied Health Services Training Centre ( the forerunner of the Faculty of Health Sciences ) was established by the Ministry of Health . The Vocational Training Centre was established in 1974 , providing training for mechanical and electrical trades . In 1984 , the Institute for Teacher Education was created and the School of Hotel and Catering Services was established in 1987 to provide trained personnel for the tourist industry . In 1991 , the Institute of Management and Administration was created to train staff for public and private services . In 1998 , the Maldives College of Higher Education was founded . The Institute of Shar'ah and Law was founded in January 1999 . In 2000 the college launched its first-degree programme , Bachelor of Arts . On 17 January 2011 the Maldives National University Act was passed by the President of the Maldives ;

Tanzania ( ; ) , officially the United Republic of Tanzania ( Jamhuri ya Muungano wa Tanzania ) , is a country in East Africa within the African Great Lakes region . It borders Uganda to the north ; Kenya to the northeast ; Comoro Islands and the Indian Ocean to the east ; Mozambique and Malawi to the south ; Zambia to the southwest ; and Rwanda , Burundi , and the Democratic Republic of the Congo to the west . Mount Kilimanjaro , Africa 's highest mountain , is in northeastern Tanzania .
Many important [ fossils have been found in Tanzania , such as 6-million-year-old Pliocene ] hominid fossils . The genus [ [ Australopithecus ranged all over Africa 4 to 2 million years ago ; and the oldest remains of the genus Homo are found near Olduvai Gorge . Following the rise of Homo erectus 1.8 ; million years ago , humanity spread all over the Old World , and later in the New World and Australia under the species Homo sapiens . H. sapiens also overtook Africa and absorbed the older archaic species and subspecies of humanity . One of the oldest known ethnic groups still existing , the Hadza people , appears to have originated in Tanzania , and their oral history recalls ancestors who were tall and were the first to use fire , medicine , and lived in caves , much like Homo erectus or Homo heidelbergensis who lived in the same region before them .
Later in the Stone and Bronze Age , prehistoric migrations into Tanzania included South Cushitic languages speakers who moved south from present-day Ethiopia ; Eastern Cushitic people who moved into Tanzania from north of Lake Turkana about 2,000 and 4,000 years ago ; and the Southern Nilotic languages , including the Datooga people , who originated from the present-day South SudanEthiopia border region between 2,900 and 2,400 years ago . These movements took place at about the same time as the settlement of the Bantu languages from West Africa in the Lake Victoria and Lake Tanganyika areas . They subsequently migrated across the rest of Tanzania between 2,300 and 1,700 years ago .
German rule began in mainland Tanzania during the late 19th century when Germany formed German East Africa . This was followed by British rule after World War I . The mainland was governed as Tanganyika , with the Zanzibar Archipelago remaining a separate colonial jurisdiction . Following their respective independence in 1961 and 1963 , the two entities merged in 1964 to form the United Republic of Tanzania . The countries had joined the British Commonwealth of Nations in 1961 and Tanzania is still a member of the Commonwealth as one republic .
The United Nations estimated Tanzania 's population at million , which is slightly smaller than South Africa , making it the second most populous country located entirely south of the Equator . The population is composed of about 120 Ethnic groups , Linguistic groups , and religious groups . The sovereign state of Tanzania is a Presidential system constitutional republic and since 1996 its official capital city has been Dodoma where the president 's office , the National Assembly ( Tanzania ) , and some government ministries are located . Dar es Salaam , the former capital , retains most government offices and is the country 's largest city , principal port , and leading commercial centre . Tanzania is a Dominant-party system de facto one-party state with the Democratic socialism Chama Cha Mapinduzi party in power .
Tanzania is mountainous and densely forested in the north-east , where Mount Kilimanjaro is located . Three of African Great Lakes Africa 's Great Lakes are partly within Tanzania . To the north and west lie Lake Victoria , Africa 's largest lake , and Lake Tanganyika , the continent 's deepest lake , known for its unique species of fish . To the south lies Lake Malawi . The eastern shore is hot and humid , with the Zanzibar Archipelago just offshore . The Menai Bay Conservation Area is Zanzibar 's largest marine protected area . The Kalambo Falls , located on the Kalambo River at the Zambian border , is the second highest uninterrupted waterfall in Africa .
Christianity is the largest religion in Tanzania , but there are also substantial Muslim and Animism minorities . Over 100 different Languages of Tanzania , making it the most linguistically diverse country in East Africa . The country does not have a de jure official language , although the national language is Swahili language . Swahili is used in parliamentary debate , in the lower courts , and as a medium of instruction in primary school . English is used in foreign trade , in diplomacy , in higher courts , and as a medium of instruction in secondary and higher education ; although the Tanzanian government is planning to discontinue English as the primary language of instruction it will be available as an optional course . Approximately 10 per cent of Tanzanians speak Swahili as a first language , and up to 90 per cent speak it as a second language .
==Etymology==
The name `` Tanzania '' was created as a clipped compound of the names of the two states that unified to create the country : Tanganyika and People 's Republic of Zanzibar . It consists of the first three letters of the names of the two states ( `` Tan '' and `` Zan '' ) and the suffix , `` ia '' to form Tanzania .
The name `` Tanganyika '' is derived from the Swahili language words tanga ( `` sail '' ) and nyika ( `` uninhabited plain '' , `` wilderness '' ) , creating the phrase `` sail in the wilderness '' . It is sometimes understood as a reference to Lake Tanganyika .
The name of Zanzibar comes from `` Zanj '' , the name for a local people ( said to mean `` black '' ) , and the Arabic word `` barr '' , which means coast or shore .
==History==
===Ancient===
The indigenous populations of eastern Africa are thought to be the Hadza language Hadza people and Sandawe people hunter-gatherers of Tanzania .
The first wave of migration was by South Cushitic languages speakers who moved south from Ethiopia and Somalia into Tanzania . They are ancestral to the Iraqw language , Gorowa language , and Burunge language . Based on linguistic evidence , there may also have been two movements into Tanzania of Eastern Cushitic people at about 4,000 and 2,000 years ago , originating from north of Lake Turkana .
Archaeological evidence supports the conclusion that Southern Nilotic languages , including the Datooga people , moved south from the present-day South Sudan / Ethiopia border region into central northern Tanzania between 2,900 and 2,400 years ago .
These movements took place at approximately the same time as the settlement of the iron-making Bantu languages from West Africa in the Lake Victoria and Lake Tanganyika areas . They brought with them the west African planting tradition and the primary staple of yam ( vegetable ) . They subsequently migrated out of these regions across the rest of Tanzania between 2,300 and 1,700 years ago .
Eastern Nilotic languages peoples , including the Maasai people , represent a more recent migration from present-day South Sudan within the past 500 to 1,500 years .
The people of Tanzania have been associated with the production of iron and steel . The Pare people were the main producers of highly demanded iron for peoples who occupied the mountain regions of north-eastern Tanzania . The Haya people on the western shores of Lake Victoria invented a type of high-heat blast furnace , which allowed them to forge carbon steel at temperatures exceeding more than 1,500 years ago .
Travelers and merchants from the Persian Gulf and India have visited the east African coast since early in the first millennium AD . Islam was practised by some on the Swahili Coast as early as the eighth or ninth century A.D.
===Medieval===
Bantu-speakers built farming and trade villages along the Tanzanian coast from the outset of the first millennium . Archaeological finds at Fukuchani , on the north-west coast of Zanzibar , indicate a settled agricultural and fishing community from the 6th century CE at the latest . The considerable amount of daub found indicates timber buildings , and shell beads , bead grinders , and iron slag have been found at the site . There is evidence for limited engagement in long-distance trade : a small amount of imported pottery has been found , less than 1 % of total pottery finds , mostly from the Gulf and dated to the 5th to 8th century . The similarity to contemporary sites such as Mkokotoni and Dar es Salaam indicate a unified group of communities that developed into the first center of coastal maritime culture . The coastal towns appear to have been engaged in Indian Ocean and inland African trade at this early period . Trade rapidly increased in importance and quantity beginning in the mid-8th century and by the close of the 10th century Zanzibar was one of the central Swahili trading towns .
Growth in Egyptian and Persian shipping from the Red Sea and the Persian Gulf revitalized Indian Ocean trade , particularly after the Fatimid Caliphate relocated to Fustat ( Cairo ) . Swahili agriculturalists built increasingly dense settlements to tap into trade , these forming the earliest Swahili city-states . The Venda-Shona Kingdoms of Mapungubwe and Zimbabwe in South Africa and Zimbabwe , respectively , became a major producer of gold around this same period . Economic , social , and religious power was increasingly vested in Kilwa Sultanate , Tanzania 's major medieval city-state . Kilwa controlled a number of smaller ports stretching down to modern-day Mozambique . Sofala became the major gold emporium and Kilwa grew rich off the trade , lying at the southern end of the Indian Ocean Monsoons . Kilwa 's major rivals lay to the north , in modern-day Kenya , namely Mombasa and Malindi . Kilwa remained the major power in East Africa until the arrival of the Portuguese at the end of the 15th century .
===Colonial===
Claiming the coastal strip , Omani Sultan Said bin Sultan moved his capital to Zanzibar City in 1840 . During this time , Zanzibar became the centre for the east African slave trade . Between 65 and 90 per cent of the Arab-Swahili people population of Zanzibar was enslaved . One of the most infamous slave traders on the East African coast was Tippu Tip , who was the grandson of an enslaved African . The Nyamwezi people slave traders operated under the leadership of Msiri and Mirambo . According to Timothy Insoll , `` Figures record the exporting of 718,000 slaves from the Swahili coast during the 19th century , and the retention of 769,000 on the coast . '' In the 1890s , slavery was abolished .
In the late 19th century , Germany conquered the regions that are now Tanzania ( minus Zanzibar ) and incorporated them into German East Africa ( GEA ) . The Supreme Council of the Paris Peace Conference , 1919 awarded all of GEA to Britain on 7 May 1919 , over the strenuous objections of Belgium . The British Secretary of State for the Colonies , Alfred Milner , 1st Viscount Milner , and Belgium 's minister plenipotentiary to the conference , , then negotiated the Anglo-Belgian agreement of 30 May 1919 where Britain ceded the north-western GEA provinces of Ruanda-Urundi to Belgium . The conference 's Commission on Mandates ratified this agreement on 16 July 1919 . The Supreme Council accepted the agreement on 7 August 1919 . On 12 July 1919 , the Commission on Mandates agreed that the small Kionga Triangle south of the Rovuma River would be given to Portuguese Mozambique , with it eventually becoming part of independent Mozambique . The commission reasoned that Germany had virtually forced Portugal to cede the triangle in 1894 . The Treaty of Versailles was signed on 28 July 1919 , although the treaty did not take effect until 10 January 1920 . On that date , the GEA was transferred officially to Britain , Belgium , and Portugal . Also on that date , `` Tanganyika '' became the name of the British territory .
During World War II , about 100,000 people from Tanganyika joined the Allies of World War II and were among the 375,000 Africans who fought with those forces . Tanganyikans fought in units of the King 's African Rifles during the East African campaign ( World War II ) in Somalia and Ethiopian Empire against the Italians , in Madagascar against the Vichy French during the Battle of Madagascar , and in Burma against the Empire of Japan during the Burma Campaign 194445 . Tanganyika was an important source of food during this war , and its export income increased greatly compared to the pre-war years of the Great Depression Wartime demand , however , caused increased commodity prices and massive inflation within the colony .
In 1954 , Julius Nyerere transformed an organisation into the politically oriented Tanganyika African National Union ( TANU ) . TANU 's main objective was to achieve national sovereignty for Tanganyika . A campaign to register new members was launched , and within a year , TANU had become the leading political organisation in the country . Nyerere became Minister of British-administered Tanganyika in 1960 and continued as prime minister when Tanganyika became independent in 1961.
===Modern===
British rule came to an end on 9 December 1961 , but for the first year of independence , Tanganyika had a governor general who represented the British monarch . Tanganyika also joined the Commonwealth of Nations in 1961 . On 9 December 1962 , Tanganyika became a democratic republic under an executive president .
After the Zanzibar Revolution overthrew the Arab dynasty in neighbouring Zanzibar , accompanied with the slaughter of thousands of Arab Zanzibarians , which had become independent in 1963 , the archipelago merged with mainland Tanganyika on 26 April 1964 . The new country was then named the United Republic of Tanganyika and Zanzibar . On 29 October of the same year , the country was renamed the United Republic of Tanzania ( `` Tan '' comes from Tanganyika and `` Zan '' from Zanzibar ) . The union of the two hitherto separate regions was controversial among many Zanzibaris ( even those sympathetic to the revolution ) but was accepted by both the Nyerere government and the Revolutionary Government of Zanzibar owing to shared political values and goals .
Following Tanganyika 's independence and unification with Zanzibar leading to the state of Tanzania , President Nyerere emphasised a need to construct a national identity for the citizens of the new country . To achieve this , Nyerere provided what is regarded as one of the most successful cases of ethnic repression and identity transformation in Africa . With over 130 languages spoken within its territory , Tanzania is one of the most ethnically diverse countries in Africa . Despite this obstacle , ethnic divisions remained rare in Tanzania when compared to the rest of the continent , notably its immediate neighbour , Kenya . Furthermore , since its independence , Tanzania has displayed more political stability than most African countries , particularly due to Nyerere 's ethnic repression methods .
In 1967 , Nyerere 's first presidency took a turn to the left politics after the Arusha Declaration , which codified a commitment to socialism as well as Pan-Africanism . After the declaration , banks and many large industries were nationalised .
Tanzania was also aligned with China , which from 1970 to 1975 financed and helped build the TAZARA Railway from Dar es Salaam to Zambia . Nonetheless , from the late 1970s , Tanzania 's economy took a turn for the worse , in the context of an international economic crisis affecting both developed and developing economies .
From the mid-1980s , the regime financed itself by borrowing from the International Monetary Fund and underwent some reforms . Since then , Tanzania 's gross domestic product per capita has grown and poverty has been reduced , according to a report by the World Bank .
In 1992 , the Constitution of Tanzania was amended to allow multiple political parties . In Tanzania 's first multi-party elections , held in 1995 , the ruling Chama Cha Mapinduzi won 186 of the 232 elected seats in the National Assembly , and Benjamin Mkapa was elected as president .
==Geography==
At , Tanzania is the 13th largest country in Africa and the 31st largest in the world , ranked between the larger Egypt and smaller Nigeria . It borders Kenya and Uganda to the north ; Rwanda , Burundi , and the Democratic Republic of the Congo to the west ; and Zambia , Malawi , and Mozambique to the south . Tanzania is located on the eastern coast of Africa and has an Indian Ocean coastline approximately long . It also incorporates several offshore islands , including Unguja ( Zanzibar ) , Pemba Island , and Mafia Island . The country is the site of Africa 's highest and lowest points : Mount Kilimanjaro , at above sea level , and the floor of Lake Tanganyika , at below sea level , respectively .
Tanzania is mountainous and densely forested in the northeast , where Mount Kilimanjaro is located . Three of African Great Lakes Africa 's Great Lakes are partly within Tanzania . To the north and west lie Lake Victoria , Africa 's largest lake , and Lake Tanganyika , the continent 's deepest lake , known for its unique species of fish . To the southwest lies Lake Nyasa . Central Tanzania is a large plateau , with plains and arable land . The eastern shore is hot and humid , with the Zanzibar Archipelago just offshore .
Kalambo Falls in the southwestern region of Rukwa is the second highest uninterrupted waterfall in Africa , and is located near the southeastern shore of Lake Tanganyika on the border with Zambia . The Menai Bay Conservation Area is Zanzibar 's largest marine protected area .
===Climate===
Climate varies greatly within Tanzania . In the highlands , temperatures range between during cold and hot seasons respectively . The rest of the country has temperatures rarely falling lower than . The hottest period extends between November and February ( ) while the coldest period occurs between May and August ( ) . Annual temperature is . The climate is cool in high mountainous regions .
Tanzania has two major rainfall periods : one is Unimodality uni-modal ( OctoberApril ) and the other is bi-modal ( OctoberDecember and MarchMay ) . The former is experienced in southern , central , and western parts of the country , and the latter is found in the north from Lake Victoria extending east to the coast . The bi-modal rainfall is caused by the seasonal migration of the Intertropical Convergence Zone .
Climate change in Tanzania is resulting in rising temperatures with a higher likelihood of intense rainfall events ( resulting in flooding ) and of dry spells ( resulting in droughts ) . Climate change is already impacting the sectors in Tanzania of agriculture , water resources , health and energy . Sea level rise and changes in the quality of water are expected to impact fisheries and aquaculture .
Tanzania produced a National Adaptation Programme of Action ( NAPAs ) in 2007 as mandated by the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change . In 2012 , Tanzania produced a National Climate Change Strategy in response to the growing concern of the negative impacts of climate change and climate variability on the country  s social , economic and physical environment .
===Wildlife and conservation===
Tanzania contains around 20 % of the species of Africa 's enormous warm-blooded Animal populace , found over its 21 National parks , reserves , 1 conservation area , and 3 marine parks . Spread over a zone of in excess of 42,000 square kilometers ( 16,000 sq . mi ) and shaping around 38 % of the nation 's area .
. Tanzania has 21 national parks , plus a variety of game and forest reserves , including the Ngorongoro Conservation Area . In western Tanzania , Gombe Stream National Park is the site of Jane Goodall 's ongoing study of Common chimpanzee behaviour , which started in 1960.
Tanzania is highly Biodiversity and contains a wide variety of animal habitats . On Tanzania 's Serengeti plain , white-bearded wildebeest ( Connochaetes taurinus mearnsi ) , other bovids and zebra participate in a large-scale annual migration . Tanzania is home to about 130 amphibian and over 275 reptile species , many of them strictly Endemism and included in the International Union for Conservation of Nature 's Red Lists of countries . Tanzania has the largest lion population in the world .
Tanzania had a 2019 Forest Landscape Integrity Index mean score of 7.13/10 , ranking it 54th globally out of 172 countries .

==Politics==
===Government===
Tanzania is a one party dominant state with the Chama Cha Mapinduzi ( CCM ) party in power . From its formation until 1992 , it was the only legally permitted party in the country . This changed on 1 July 1992 , when the constitution was amended .
John Magufuli won the October 2015 presidential election and secured a two-thirds majority in parliament . The main opposition party in Tanzania is called Chadema Chama cha Demokrasia na Maendeleo ( Chadema ) ( Swahili language for `` Party for Democracy and Progress '' ) . In Zanzibar , the country 's semi-autonomous state , the Civic United Front Civil United Front ( CUF ) is considered the main opposition political party .
In November 2020 Magufuli once again was declared the winner for his second term as president . Election fraud was suspected . The national electoral commission announced that Magufuli received 84 % , or about 12.5 million votes and the top opposition candidate , Tundu Lissu received 13 % , about 1.9 million votes .
===Executive===
The president of Tanzania and the List of Tanzania National Assembly members are elected concurrently by direct popular vote for five-year terms . The Vice President of Tanzania vice-president is elected for a five-year term at the same time as the president and on the same ticket . Neither the president nor the vice-president may be a member of the National Assembly . The president appoints a Prime Minister of Tanzania , subject to confirmation by the assembly , to serve as the government 's leader in the assembly . The president selects his or her Cabinet of Tanzania from assembly members .
===Legislature===
All Legislature power relating to mainland Tanzania and union matters is vested in the National Assembly of Tanzania , which is unicameral and has a maximum of 357 members . These include members elected to represent constituencies , the attorney general , five members elected by the Zanzibar house of representatives from among its own members , the special women 's seats that constitute at least 30 % of the seats that any party has in the assembly , the speaker of the assembly ( if not otherwise a member of the assembly ) , and the persons ( not more than ten ) appointed by the president . The Tanzania Electoral Commission demarcates the mainland into constituencies in the number determined by the commission with the consent of the president .
===Judiciary===
Tanzania 's legal system is based on English common law .
Tanzania has a four-level judiciary . The lowest-level courts on the Tanzanian mainland are the Primary Courts . In Zanzibar , the lowest-level courts are the Kadhi 's Courts for Islamic family matters and the Primary Courts for all other cases . On the mainland , appeal is to either the District Courts or the Resident Magistrates Courts . In Zanzibar , appeal is to the Kadhi 's Appeal Courts for Islamic family matters and the Magistrates Courts for all other cases . From there , appeal is to the High Court of Tanzania . No appeal regarding Islamic family matters can be made from the High Court of Zanzibar . Otherwise , the final appeal is to the Court of Appeal of Tanzania .
The High Court of mainland Tanzania has three divisions  commercial , labour , and land  and 15 geographic zones . The High Court of Zanzibar has an industrial division , which hears only labour disputes .
Mainland and union judges are appointed by the Chief Justice of Tanzania , except for those of the Appellate court and the High Court , who are appointed by the president of Tanzania .
Tanzania is a party to the Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court .
===Zanzibar===
The legislative authority in Zanzibar over all non-union matters is vested in the House of Representatives ( Zanzibar ) ( per the Tanzania constitution ) or the Legislative Council ( per the Zanzibar constitution ) .
The Legislative Council has two parts : the president of Zanzibar and the House of Representatives . The president is Zanzibar 's head of government and the chairman of the Revolutionary Council , in which the executive authority of Zanzibar is invested . Zanzibar has two vice-presidents , with the first being from the main opposition party in the house . The second is from the party in power and is the leader of government business in the House .
The president and the members of the House of Representatives have five-year terms and can be elected for a second term .
The president selects ministers from members of the House of Representatives , with the ministers allocated according to the number of House seats won by political parties . The Revolutionary Council consists of the president , both vice-presidents , all ministers , the attorney general of Zanzibar , and other house members deemed fit by the president .
The House of Representatives is composed of elected members , ten members appointed by the president , all the regional commissioners of Zanzibar , the attorney general , and appointed female members whose number must be equal to 30 per cent of the elected members . The House determines the number of its elected members with the Zanzibar Electoral Commission determining the boundaries of each election constituency . In 2013 , the House had 81 members : fifty elected members , five regional commissioners , the attorney general , ten members appointed by the president , and fifteen appointed female members .
===Administrative subdivisions===
In 1972 , local government on the mainland was abolished and replaced with direct rule from the central government . Local government , however , was reintroduced in the beginning of the 1980s , when the rural councils and rural authorities were re-established . Local government elections took place in 1983 , and functioning councils started in 1984 . In 1999 , a Local Government Reform Programme was enacted by the National Assembly ( Tanzania ) , setting `` a comprehensive and ambitious agenda ... [ covering ] four areas : political decentralization , financial decentralization , administrative decentralization and changed central-local relations , with the mainland government having overriding powers within the framework of the Constitution . ''
As of 2016 , Tanzania is divided into thirty-one Regions of Tanzania ( mkoa ) , twenty-six on the mainland and five in Zanzibar ( three on Unguja , two on Pemba , Tanzania ) . In 2012 , the thirty former regions were divided into 169 Districts of Tanzania ( wilaya ) , also known as local government authorities . Of those districts , 34 were urban units , which were further classified as three city councils ( Arusha , Mbeya , and Mwanza ) , nineteen municipal councils , and twelve town councils .
The urban units have an autonomous city , municipal , or town council and are subdivided into wards and mtaa . The non-urban units have an autonomous district council but are subdivided into village councils or township authorities ( first level ) and then into vitongoji .
The city of Dar es Salaam is unique because it has a city council whose area of jurisdiction overlaps three municipal councils . The mayor of the city council is elected by that council . The twenty-member city council is composed of eleven persons elected by the municipal councils , seven members of the National Assembly , and `` Nominated members of parliament under 'Special Seats ' for women '' . Each municipal council also has a mayor . `` The City Council performs a coordinating role and attends to issues cutting across the three municipalities '' , including security and emergency services . The city of Mwanza has a city council whose areal jurisdiction overlaps two municipal councils .
===Foreign relations===
====Bilateral relations====
Apart from its border dispute with Malawi , Tanzania had cordial relations with its neighbours in 2012.
MalawiTanzania relations have been tense because of a Lake Malawi # TanzaniaMalawi dispute over the countries ' Lake Nyasa ( Lake Malawi ) border . An unsuccessful mediation regarding this issue took place in March 2014 . The two countries agreed in 2013 to ask the International Court of Justice ( ICJ ) to resolve the dispute should mediation be unsuccessful . Malawi , but not Tanzania , has accepted the compulsory jurisdiction of the ICJ .
RwandaTanzania relations deteriorated in 2013 when Tanzanian President Jakaya Kikwete said that if the Democratic Republic of the Congo ( DRC ) could negotiate with some of its enemies , Rwanda should be able to do the same . Rwandan President Paul Kagame then expressed `` contempt '' for Kikwete 's statement . The tension was renewed in May 2014 when , in a speech to the Tanzanian National Assembly ( Tanzania ) , Foreign Affairs Minister Bernard Membe renewed his claim that Rwandans were causing instability in the DRC . Rwandan Foreign Affairs Minister Louise Mushikiwabo responded , `` As for Tanzania 's foreign minister whose anti-Rwanda rant in parliament I heard , he would benefit from a lesson in the history of the region . ''
Tanzania has maintained strong Tanzania-United Kingdom relations with the United Kingdom since its independence ; Britain remains the largest non-African importer of Tanzanian tea and other raw materials are exchanged . Britain remains a high contributor of tourists to Tanzania . Both are members of the Commonwealth of Nations and engage in strategic union in defence , security and ceremonial affairs ; the Tanzanian High Commission of Tanzania , London is in London and the British have a British High Commission , Dar es Salaam in Dar es Salaam .
TanzaniaChina relations have strengthened in recent years as trade between the two countries and Chinese investment in Tanzanian infrastructure have increased rapidly .
TanzaniaUnited States relations are warm , with President Barack Obama List of presidential trips made by Barack Obama in 2013.
Tanzania 's relations with other donor countries , including Japan and members of the European Union , are generally good , though donors are concerned about Tanzania 's commitment to reducing government corruption .
====Multilateral relations====
Tanzania is a member of the East African Community ( EAC ) , along with Uganda , Kenya , Rwanda , Burundi and South Sudan . According to the East African Common Market Protocol of 2010 , the free trade and free movement of people is guaranteed , including the right to reside in another member country for purposes of employment . This protocol , however , has not been implemented because of work permit and other bureaucratic , legal , and financial obstacles .
Tanzania is also a member of the Southern African Development Community ( SADC ) . The EAC , the SADC , and the Common Market for Eastern and Southern Africa agreed in June 2011 to negotiate the creation of a Tripartite Free Trade Area spanning 26 African countries , with a goal to complete the first phase of negotiations within 36 months .
As of 31 October 2014 , Tanzania was contributing 2,253 soldiers and other personnel to various United Nations peacekeeping operations . The Tanzania People 's Defence Force is participating along with South African and Malawian militaries in the United Nations Force Intervention Brigade ( MONUSCO ) in the Democratic Republic of the Congo ( DRC ) . The United Nations Security Council authorised the force on 28 March 2013 to conduct targeted offensive operations to neutralise groups that threaten peace in the DRC . Tanzania was also participating in peacekeeping missions in the Darfur Region of Sudan ( UNAMID ) ; Abyei , control of which is contested between South Sudan and Sudan ( UNISFA ) ; the Central African Republic ( MINUSCA ) ; Lebanon ( UNIFIL ) ; and South Sudan ( UNMISS ) .
In 2019 , Tanzania signed the UN treaty on the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons .
===Military===
The Tanzania People 's Defence Force ( TPDF ) ( Kiswahili : Jeshi la Wananchi wa Tanzania ( JWTZ ) ) is the armed forces of Tanzania , operating as a people 's force under civilian control . It is composed of three branches or commands : Land Force ( army ) , Air Force , Naval Command . Tanzanian citizens are able to volunteer for military service from 15 years of age , and 18 years of age for compulsory military service upon graduation from secondary school . Conscript service obligation was 2 years as of 2004.
===Human rights===
Throughout Tanzania , LGBT rights by country or territory are illegal and carry a maximum penalty of life imprisonment . According to a 2007 Pew Research Centre survey , 95 per cent of Tanzanians believed that homosexuality should not be accepted by society .
People with albinism living in Tanzania are often attacked , killed or mutilated because of superstitions related to the black-magical practice known as muti that say body parts of albinos have magical properties .
Tanzania has the highest occurrence of this human rights violation among 27 African countries where muti is known to be practised .
In December 2019 , Amnesty International reported that the Tanzanian government annulled the right of NGOs as well as individuals to directly file any case against it at the Arusha-based African Court for Human and Peoples ' Rights .
==Economy and infrastructure==
, according to the IMF , Tanzania 's gross domestic product ( GDP ) was an estimated $ 56.7 ; billion ( nominal ) , or $ 176.5 ; billion on a purchasing power parity ( PPP ) basis . GDP per capita ( PPP ) was $ 3,457 .
From 2009 through 2013 , Tanzania 's per capita GDP ( based on constant local currency ) grew an average of 3.5 % per year , higher than any other member of the East African Community ( EAC ) and exceeded by only nine countries in Sub-Saharan Africa : the Democratic Republic of the Congo , Ethiopia , Ghana , Lesotho , Liberia , Mozambique , Sierra Leone , Zambia , and Zimbabwe .
Tanzania 's largest trading partners in 2017 for its US $ 5.3 ; billion in exports were India , Vietnam , South Africa , Switzerland , and China . Its imports totalled US $ 8.17 ; billion , with India , Switzerland , Saudi Arabia , China , and the United Arab Emirates being the biggest partners .
Tanzania weathered the Great Recession , which began in late 2008 or early 2009 , relatively well . Strong gold prices , bolstering the country 's Mining industry of Tanzania , and Tanzania 's poor integration into global markets helped to insulate the country from the downturn . Since the recession ended , the Tanzanian economy has expanded rapidly thanks to strong tourism , telecommunications , and banking sectors .
According to the United Nations Development Programme , however , recent growth in the national economy has benefited only the `` very few '' , leaving out the majority of the population . Tanzania 's 2013 Global Hunger Index was worse than any other country in the EAC except Burundi . The proportion of persons who were undernourished in 201012 was also worse than any other EAC country except Burundi .
In 2020 , the World Bank declared the rise of the Tanzanian economy from low income to lower middle income country , with a gross domestic product ( GDP ) estimated to be between US $ 1,006 and US $ 3,955 .
===Hunger and poverty===
Tanzania has made some progress towards reducing extreme hunger and malnutrition . The Global Hunger Index ranked the situation as `` alarming '' with a score of 42 in the year 2000 ; since then the GHI has declined to 29.5 . Children in rural areas suffer substantially higher rates of malnutrition and chronic hunger , although urban-rural disparities have narrowed as regards both stunting and underweight . Low rural sector productivity arises mainly from inadequate infrastructure investment ; limited access to farm inputs , extension services and credit ; limited technology as well as trade and marketing support ; and heavy dependence on rain-fed agriculture and natural resources .
Approximately 68 per cent of Tanzania 's 44.9 ; million citizens live below the poverty line of $ 1.25 a day . 32 per cent of the population are malnourished . The most prominent challenges Tanzania faces in poverty reduction are unsustainable harvesting of its natural resources , unchecked cultivation , climate change and water- source encroachment , according to the United Nations Development Programme ( UNDP ) .
There are very few resources for Tanzanians in terms of credit services , infrastructure or availability to improved agricultural technologies , which further exacerbates hunger and poverty in the country according to the United Nations Development Programme UNDP . Tanzania ranks 159 out of 187 countries in poverty according to the United Nation 's Human Development Index ( 2014 ) .
The 2019 World Bank report showed that in the last 10 years , poverty has reduced by 8 per cent , from 34.4 % in 2007 to 26.4 % in 2018.
===Agriculture===
The Tanzanian economy is heavily based on agriculture , which in 2013 accounted for 24.5 per cent of gross domestic product , provides 85 % of exports , and accounted for half of the employed workforce ; The agricultural sector grew 4.3 per cent in 2012 , less than half of the Millennium Development Goal target of 10.8 % . 16.4 per cent of the land is Arable land , with 2.4 per cent of the land planted with permanent crops . Tanzania 's economy relies on farming , but climate change has impacted their farming .
Maize was the largest food crop on the Tanzania mainland in 2013 ( 5.17 ; million tonnes ) , followed by cassava ( 1.94 ; million tonnes ) , sweet potatoes ( 1.88 ; million tonnes ) , beans ( 1.64 ; million tonnes ) , bananas ( 1.31 ; million tonnes ) , rice ( 1.31 ; million tonnes ) , and millet ( 1.04 ; million tonnes ) . Sugar was the largest cash crop on the mainland in 2013 ( 296,679 tonnes ) , followed by cotton ( 241,198 tonnes ) , cashew nuts ( 126,000 tonnes ) , tobacco ( 86,877 tonnes ) , coffee ( 48,000 tonnes ) , sisal ( 37,368 tonnes ) , and tea ( 32,422 tonnes ) . Beef was the largest meat product on the mainland in 2013 ( 299,581 tonnes ) , followed by lamb/mutton ( 115,652 tonnes ) , chicken ( 87,408 tonnes ) , and pork ( 50,814 tonnes ) .
According to the 2002 National Irrigation Master Plan , 29.4 ; million hectares in Tanzania are suitable for irrigation farming ; however , only 310,745 hectares were actually being irrigated in June 2011.
===Industry , energy and construction===
Industry and construction is a major and growing component of the Tanzanian economy , contributing 22.2 per cent of GDP in 2013 . This component includes mining and quarrying , manufacturing , electricity and natural gas , water supply , and construction . Mining contributed 3.3 per cent of GDP in 2013 . The vast majority of the country 's mineral export revenue comes from gold , accounting for 89 per cent of the value of those exports in 2013 . It also exports sizeable quantities of gemstones , including diamonds and tanzanite . All of Tanzania 's coal production , which totalled 106,000 short tons in 2012 , is used domestically .
Only 15 per cent of Tanzanians had access to electric power in 2011 . The government-owned TANESCO ( TANESCO ) dominates the electric supply industry in Tanzania . The country generated 6.013 ; billion kilowatt hours ( kWh ) of electricity in 2013 , a 4.2 per cent increase over the 5.771 ; billion kWh generated in 2012 . Generation increased by 63 per cent between 2005 and 2012 ; Almost 18 per cent of the electricity generated in 2012 was lost because of theft and transmission and distribution problems . The electrical supply varies , particularly when droughts disrupt hydropower electric generation ; rolling blackouts are implemented as necessary . The unreliability of the electrical supply has hindered the development of Tanzanian industry . In 2013 , 49.7 per cent of Tanzania 's electricity generation came from natural gas , 28.9 per cent from hydroelectric sources , 20.4 per cent from thermal sources , and 1.0 per cent from outside the country . The government has built a gas pipeline from Mnazi Bay-Ruvuma Estuary Marine Park to Dar es Salaam . This pipeline was expected to allow the country to double its electricity generation capacity to 3,000 megawatts by 2016 . The government 's goal is to increase capacity to at least 10,000 megawatts by 2025.
According to PFC Energy , 25 to 30 ; trillion cubic feet of recoverable natural gas resources have been discovered in Tanzania since 2010 , bringing the total reserves to over 43 ; trillion cubic feet by the end of 2013 . The value of natural gas actually produced in 2013 was US $ 52.2 ; million , a 42.7 per cent increase over 2012.
Commercial production of gas from the Songo Songo Island field in the Indian Ocean commenced in 2004 , thirty years after it was discovered there . Over 35 ; billion cubic feet of gas was produced from this field in 2013 , with proven , probable , and possible reserves totalling 1.1 ; trillion cubic feet . The gas is transported by pipeline to Dar es Salaam . As of 27 August 2014 , TANESCO owed the operator of this field , Orca Exploration Group Inc.
A newer natural gas field in Mnazi Bay in 2013 produced about one-seventh of the amount produced near Songo Songo Island but has proven , probable , and possible reserves of 2.2 ; trillion cubic feet . Virtually all of that gas is being used for electricity generation in Mtwara .
The Ruvuma and Nyuna regions of Tanzania have been explored mostly by the discovery company that holds a 75 per cent interest , Aminex , and has shown to hold in excess of 3.5 ; trillion cubic feet of natural gas . A pipeline connecting offshore natural gas fields to Tanzania 's commercial capital Dar es Salaam was completed at the end of April 2015.
===Tourism===
Travel and tourism contributed 17.5 per cent of Tanzania 's gross domestic product in 2016 and employed 11.0 per cent of the country 's labour force ( 1,189,300 jobs ) in 2013 . Overall receipts rose from US $ 1.74 ; billion in 2004 to US $ 4.48 ; billion in 2013 , and receipts from international tourists rose from US $ 1.255 ; billion in 2010 to US $ 2 ; billion in 2016 . In 2016 , 1,284,279 tourists arrived at Tanzania 's borders compared to 590,000 in 2005 . The vast majority of tourists visit Zanzibar or a `` northern circuit '' of Serengeti National Park , the Ngorongoro Conservation Area , Tarangire National Park , Lake Manyara National Park , and Mount Kilimanjaro . In 2013 , the most visited national park was Serengeti ( 452,485 tourists ) , followed by Manyara ( 187,773 ) and Tarangire ( 165,949 ) .
===Banking===
The Bank of Tanzania is the central bank of Tanzania and is primarily responsible for maintaining price stability , with a subsidiary responsibility for issuing Tanzanian shilling notes and coins . At the end of 2013 , the total assets of the Tanzanian banking industry were 19.5 ; trillion Tanzanian shillings , a 15 per cent increase over 2012.
===Transport===
Most transport in Tanzania is by road , with road transport constituting over 75 per cent of the country 's freight traffic and 80 per cent of its passenger traffic . The road system is in generally poor condition . Tanzania has two railway companies : TAZARA , which provides service between Dar es Salaam and Kapiri Mposhi ( in a copper-mining district in Zambia ) , and Tanzania Railways Limited , which connects Dar es Salaam with central and northern Tanzania . Rail travel in Tanzania often entails slow journeys with frequent cancellations or delays , and the railways have a deficient safety record .
In Dar es Salaam , there is a huge project of rapid buses , Dar Rapid Transit Agency Dar Rapid Transit ( DART ) which connects suburbs of Dar es Salaam city . The development of the DART system consists of six phases and is funded by the African Development Bank , the World Bank and the Government of Tanzania . The first phase began in April 2012 , and it was completed in December 2015 and launched operations in May 2016.
Tanzania has four international airports , along with over 120 small airports or landing strips . Airport infrastructure tends to be in poor condition . Airlines in Tanzania include Air Tanzania , Precision Air , Fastjet , Coastal Aviation , and ZanAir .
===Communications===
In 2013 , the communications sector was the fastest growing in Tanzania , expanding 22.8 per cent ; however , the sector accounted for only 2.4 per cent of gross domestic product that year .
As of 2011 , Tanzania had 56 mobile telephone subscribers per 100 inhabitants , a rate slightly above the sub-Saharan average . Very few Tanzanians have fixed-line telephones . Approximately 12 per cent of Tanzanians used the internet , though this number is growing rapidly . The country has a fibre-optic cable network that replaced unreliable satellite service , but internet bandwidth remains very low .
=== Water supply and sanitation ===
Water supply and sanitation in Tanzania has been characterised by decreasing access to improved water sources in the 2000s ( especially in urban areas ) , steady access to some form of sanitation ( around 93 per cent since the 1990s ) , intermittent water supplies , and generally low quality of service . Many utilities are barely able to cover their operation and maintenance costs through revenues because of low tariffs and poor efficiency . There are significant Regions of Tanzania differences , with the best performing utilities being Arusha , Moshi , Tanzania , and Tanga , Tanzania .
The government of Tanzania has embarked on a major sector reform process since 2002 . An ambitious National Water Sector Development Strategy that promotes Integrated Water Resources Management and the development of urban and rural water supply was adopted in 2006 . Decentralisation has meant that responsibility for water and sanitation service provision has shifted to local government authorities and is carried out by 20 urban utilities and about 100 district utilities , as well as by Community Owned Water Supply Organisations in rural areas .
These reforms have been backed by a significant increase of the budget starting in 2006 , when the water sector was included among the priority sectors of the National Strategy for Growth and Reduction of Poverty . The Tanzanian water sector remains heavily dependent on external donors , with 88 per cent of the available funds being provided by external donor organisations . Results have been mixed . For example , a report by Deutsche Gesellschaft fr Internationale Zusammenarbeit noted that `` despite heavy investments brought in by the World Bank and the European Union , ( the utility serving Dar es Salaam ) has remained one of the worst performing water entities in Tanzania . ''
===Economic statistics controversy===
Two articles in the Economist in July 2020 raised doubts about official claims of economic growth : `` If Tanzania  s economy grew by almost 7 % in the fiscal year to the end of June 2019 , why did tax revenue fall by 1 % ? And why has bank lending to companies slumped ? Private data are bad , too . In 2019 sales at the biggest brewer fell by 5 % . Sales of cement by the two biggest producers were almost flat . None of these things is likely if growth is storming ahead . The discrepancies are so large that it is hard to avoid the conclusion that the government is lying . ''
Tim Staermose , a proponent of African investment , took issue with these data : `` Some of these statements by The Economist , based on the evidence I have gathered from primary sources  namely , the statutory financial reports that listed companies in Tanzania are legally obligated to release  are simply not true . Bank lending to companies as far as I can see has not , 'slumped . ' The two biggest banks in Tanzania , which between them account for approximately 40 % of the banking sector , both reported strong loan growth in 2019 . ... As for cement sales being 'almost flat , ' again , this is total nonsense . ... In 2019 Twiga sold 6 % more cement by volume than it did in 2018 . In the first six months of 2020 , Twiga already sold 8 % more cement than it had done by the same stage in 2019 . Again , these numbers are very consistent with an economy that  s reported to be growing at around 7 % per annum . ... [ On ] the 5 % fall in beer sales in 2019 ... the published 2019 annual report by Tanzania Breweries Limited ( TBL ) will tell you there were one-off circumstances that largely drove the decline ... [ which ] resulted in sales falling . But TBL  s profits actually rose in 2019 . ''
== Food and nutrition ==
Poor nutrition remains a persistent problem within Tanzania and varies hugely throughout the country 's regions . United States Agency for International Development reports that 16 % of children are underweight and 34 % experience stunted growth as a result of malnutrition . 10 regions house 58 % of children suffering from stunted growth while 50 % of acutely malnourished children can be found in 5 regions . Over a 5-year period , the Mara Region district of Tanzania saw a 15 % reduction in stunting in children under 5 years old , falling from 46 % to 31 % in 2005 and 2010 respectively . Dodoma , on the other hand saw a 7 % increase in the prevalence of stunting in this age group , rising from 50 % in 2005 to 57 % in 2010 . Overall availability of food does not necessarily contribute to overall stunting figures . Iringa Region , Mbeya Region and Rukwa Region regions , where overall availability of food is considered acceptable still experience stunting incidences in excess of 50 % . In some areas where food shortages are common such as in the Tabora Region and Singida Region regions , stunting incidences remain comparatively less than those seen in Iringa , Mbeya and Rukwa . The Tanzania Food and Nutrition Centre attributes these discrepancies to variance in maternal malnutrition , poor infant feeding practices , hygiene practices and poor healthcare services . Periods of drought can have significant impacts on the production of crops in Tanzania . Drought in East Africa has resulted in massive increases in the prices of food staples such as maize and Commercial sorghum , crops crucial to the nutrition of the majority of Tanzania 's population . From 2015 to 2017 the price of maize when bought wholesale more than tripled , from 400 Tanzanian shilling per kilogram to 1253 Shillings per kilogram .
Tanzania remains heavily agricultural , with 80 % of the total population engaging in subsistence farming . Rural areas are subjected to increased food shortages in comparison to urbanised areas , with a survey carried out within the country in 2017 finding 84 % of people in rural areas suffering food shortages over a 3-month period compared to 64 % of residents in cities . This disparity between rural and city nutrition can be attributed to various factors ; increased nutritional needs due to manual labour , more limited access to food as a result of poor infrastructure , high-susceptibility to the damaging effects of nature and the `` Agricultural Productivity Gap '' . The Agricultural Productivity Gap postulates that `` value added per worker '' is often much lower within the agricultural sector than that found within non-agricultural sectors . Furthermore , allocation of labour within the agricultural sector is largely allocated ineffectively .
=== Programmes targeting hunger ===
USAID programmes focussing on nutrition operate within the Morogoro , Dodoma , Iringa , Mbeya , Manyara Region , Songwe Region and Zanzibar regions of Tanzania . These `` Feed the Future Initiative '' programmes heavily invest in nutrition , infrastructure , policy , capacity of institutions and agriculture which is identified by the organisation as a key area of economic growth in the country . A Tanzanian government led initiative `` Kilimo Kwanza '' or `` Agriculture First '' aims to encourage investment into agriculture within the private sector and hopes to improve agricultural processes and development within the country by seeking the knowledge of young people and the innovation that they can potentially provide . During the 1990s , around 25 % of Tanzania 's population were provided access to iodized oil aimed to target iodine deficiency within expecting mothers , as result of studies showing the negative effects of in-utero iodine deficiency on cognitive development in children . Research showed that children of mothers with access to the supplement achieved on average greater than a third of a year more education than those who did not .
Programmes led by the World Food Programme operate within Tanzania . The Supplementary Feeding Programme ( SFP ) aims to target acute malnutrition by supplying blended food fortified with vitamins to pregnant women and mothers to children under 5 on a monthly basis . Pregnant women and mothers to children under 2 have access to the Mother and Child Health and Nutrition Programme 's `` Super Cereal '' which is supplied with the intent of reducing stunting in children . World Food Programme supplementation remains the main food source for Tanzania 's refugees . Super Cereal , Vegetable Oil , Pulses and Salt are supplied as part of the Protracted Relief and Recovery Operation to meet the average persons minimum daily caloric requirement of 2,100 kcal . UNICEF state that continued investment in nutrition within Tanzania is of the utmost importance : Estimates predict that Tanzania stands to lose $ 20 billion by 2025 if nutrition within the country remains at its current level , however improvements in nutrition could produce a gain of around $ 4.7 billion
Save the Children , with the help of UNICEF and Irish Aid funding created the Partnership for Nutrition in Tanzania ( PANITA ) , in 2011 . PANITA aims to use civil society organisations to target nutrition within the country . Alongside this , various sectors associated with nutrition are targeted such as agriculture , water , sanitation , education , economic development and social progress . PANITA is responsible for ensuring significant attention is given to nutrition in development plans and budgets created on national and regional levels within Tanzania . Since its conception , PANITA has grown from 94 to 306 participating civil society organisations nationwide . Agriculture within Tanzania is targeted by the Irish Aid led initiative Harnessing Agriculture for Nutrition Outcomes ( HANO ) , which aims to merge nutrition initiatives with agriculture in the Lindi District of the country . The project aims to reduce stunting by 10 % in children aged 0 to 23 months .
==Science and technology==
Tanzania 's first `` National Science and Technology Policy '' was adopted in 1996 . The objective of the government 's `` Vision 2025 '' ( 1998 ) document was to `` transform the economy into a strong , resilient and competitive one , buttressed by science and technology '' .
Under the umbrella of the One UN Initiative , UNESCO and Tanzanian government departments and agencies formulated a series of proposals in 2008 for revising the `` National Science and Technology Policy '' . The total reform budget of US $ 10 ; million was financed from the One UN fund and other sources . UNESCO provided support for mainstreaming science , technology , and innovation into the new `` National Growth and Poverty Reduction Strategy '' for the mainland and Zanzibar namely , Mkukuta II and Mkuza II , including in the field of tourism .
Tanzania 's revised science policy was published in 2010 . Entitled `` National Research and Development Policy '' , it recognises the need to improve the process of prioritisation of research capacities , develop international co-operation in strategic areas of research and development , and improve planning for human resources . It also makes provisions for the establishment of a National Research Fund . This policy was , in turn , reviewed in 2012 and 2013.
In 2010 , Tanzania devoted 0.38 per cent of GDP to research and development . The global average in 2013 was 1.7 per cent of GDP . Tanzania had 69 researchers ( in head counts ) per million population in 2010 . In 2014 , Tanzania counted 15 publications per million inhabitants in internationally catalogued journals , according to Thomson Reuters ' Web of Science ( Science Citation Index Expanded ) . The average for sub-Saharan Africa was 20 publications per million inhabitants and the global average 176 publications per million inhabitants .

According to the 2012 census , the total population was 44,928,923 . The under-15 age group represented 44.1 per cent of the population .
The population distribution in Tanzania is uneven . Most people live on the northern border or the eastern coast , with much of the remainder of the country being sparsely populated . Density varies from in the Katavi Region to in the Dar es Salaam Region .
Approximately 70 per cent of the population is rural , although this percentage has been declining since at least 1967 . Dar es Salaam ( population 4,364,541 ) is the largest city and commercial capital . Dodoma ( population 410,956 ) is located in the centre of Tanzania , is the capital of the country , and hosts the National Assembly ( Tanzania ) .
At the time of the foundation of the United Republic of Tanzania in 1964 the child mortality rate was 335 deaths per 1,000 live births . Since independence the rate of child deaths declined to 62 per 1000 births .
The population consists of List of ethnic groups in Tanzania . The Sukuma people , Nyamwezi people , Chaga people , and Haya people peoples each have a population exceeding 1 million . Approximately 99 per cent of Tanzanians are of native Ethnic groups of Africa descent , with small numbers of Arab , European , and Asian descent . The majority of Tanzanians , including the Sukuma and the Nyamwezi , are Bantu peoples .
The population also includes people of Arab , Persian , and Indians in Tanzania origin , and small European and Chinese people in Tanzania communities . Many also identify as Shirazi ( ethnic group ) . Thousands of Arabs , Persians , and Indians were massacred during the Zanzibar Revolution of 1964 . As of 1994 , the Asian community numbered 50,000 on the mainland and 4,000 on Zanzibar . An estimated 70,000 Arabs and 10,000 Europeans lived in Tanzania .
Some albinos in Tanzania have been the victims of violence in recent years . Attacks are often to hack off the limbs of albinos in the perverse superstitious belief that possessing the bones of albinos will bring wealth . The country has banned witch doctors to try to prevent the practice , but it has continued and albinos remain targets .
According to 2010 Tanzanian government statistics , the total fertility rate in Tanzania was 5.4 children born per woman , with 3.7 in urban mainland areas , 6.1 in rural mainland areas , and 5.1 in Zanzibar . For all women aged 4549 , 37.3 per cent had given birth to eight or more children , and for currently married women in that age group , 45.0 per cent had given birth to that many children .
===Religion===
Official statistics on religion are unavailable because religious surveys were eliminated from government census reports after 1967 . Tanzania 's religious field is dominated by Christianity and Islam as well as of different African Traditional Religions connected to ethnic customs . The word for religion in Swahili , dini , generally apply to the world religions of Christianity and Islam meaning that followers of African Traditional Religions are consider to be of `` no religion '' . Religious belonging is often ambiguous , with some people adhering to multiple religious identities at the same time ( for instance being Christian but also following African Traditional rituals ) something which point to that religious boundaries are flexible and contextual .
According to a 2014 estimate by the CIA World Factbook , 61.4 % of the population was Christian , 35.2 % was Muslim , 1.8 % practiced traditional African religions , 1.4 % were unaffiliated with any religion , and 0.2 % followed other religions . Nearly the entire population of Zanzibar is Muslim . Of Muslims , 16 % are Ahmadiyya , 20 % are non-denominational Muslims , 40 % are Sunni , 20 per cent are Shia , and 4 % are Sufism .
Within the Christian community the Roman Catholic Church is the largest denomination ( 51 % all Christians ) . Among the Protestants , the large number of Lutherans and Moravian Church points to the German missionary past of the country , while the number of Anglicans point to the British missionary history of Tanganyika . A growing number have adopted Pentecostalism , and Adventists likewise have an increasing presence because of external missionary activities from Scandinavia and the United States , especially during the first part of the 20th century . All of them have had some influence in varying degrees from the Walokole movement East African Revival ( East African Revival ) , which has also been fertile ground for the spread of Charismatic Christianity and Pentecostal groups .
There are also active communities of other religious groups , primarily on the mainland , such as Buddhism , Hinduism in Tanzania , and Bah Faith Bah's .
===Languages===
More than 100 Languages of Tanzania , making it the most linguistically diverse country in East Africa . Among the languages spoken are all four of Africa 's language families : Bantu languages , Cushitic languages , Nilotic languages , and Khoisan languages . There are no de jure official languages in Tanzania .
Swahili is used in parliamentary debate , in the lower courts , and as a medium of instruction in primary school . English is used in foreign trade , in diplomacy , in higher courts , and as a medium of instruction in secondary and higher education , The Tanzanian government , however , has plans to discontinue English as a language of instruction . In connection with his Ujamaa social policies , President Nyerere encouraged the use of Swahili to help unify the country 's many ethnic groups . Approximately 10 per cent of Tanzanians speak Swahili as a first language , and up to 90 per cent speak it as a second language . Many educated Tanzanians are trilingual , also speaking English . The widespread use and promotion of Swahili is contributing to the decline of smaller languages in the country . Young children increasingly speak Swahili as a first language , particularly in urban areas . Ethnic community languages ( ECL ) other than Kiswahili are not allowed as a language of instruction . Nor are they taught as a subject , though they might be used unofficially in some cases in initial education . Television and radio programmes in an ECL are prohibited , and it is nearly impossible to get permission to publish a newspaper in an ECL . There is no department of local or regional African Languages and Literatures at the University of Dar es Salaam .
Arabic is co-official in Zanzibar .
The Sandawe people speak a language that may be related to the Khoe languages of Botswana and Namibia , while the language of the Hadzabe people , although it has similar click consonants , is arguably a language isolate . The language of the Iraqw people is Cushitic .
===Education===
In 2012 , the literacy rate in Tanzania for persons aged 15 and over was estimated to be 67.8 per cent . Education is compulsory until children reach age 15 . In 2010 , 74.1 per cent of children age 5 to 14 years were attending school . The primary school completion rate was 80.8 per cent in 2012.
===Healthcare===
, life expectancy at birth was 61 years . The under-five mortality rate in 2012 was 54 per 1,000 live births . The maternal mortality rate in 2013 was estimated at 410 per 100,000 live births . premature death and malaria were tied in 2010 as the leading cause of death in children under 5 years old . The other leading causes of death for these children were , in decreasing order , malaria , diarrhoea , HIV , and measles .
Malaria in Tanzania causes death and disease and has a `` huge economic impact '' . There were approximately 11.5 ; million cases of clinical malaria in 2008 . In 200708 , malaria prevalence among children aged 6 months to 5 years was highest in the Kagera Region ( 41.1 per cent ) on the western shore of Lake Victoria and lowest in the Arusha Region ( 0.1 per cent ) .
According to the 2010 Tanzania Demographic and Health Survey 2010 , 15 per cent of Tanzanian women had undergone female genital mutilation ( FGM ) and 72 per cent of Tanzanian men had been circumcised . FGM is most common in the Manyara Region , Dodoma Region , Arusha Region , and Singida Region regions and nonexistent in Zanzibar . The prevalence of male circumcision was above 90 per cent in the eastern ( [ refDar es Salaam Region , Pwani Region , and Morogoro Region regions ) , northern ( Kilimanjaro Region , Tanga Region , Arusha , and Manyara regions ) , and central areas ( Dodoma and Singida Region regions ) and below 50 per cent only in the southern highlands zone ( Mbeya Region , Iringa Region , and Rukwa Region regions ) .
2012 data showed that 53 per cent of the population used improved drinking water sources ( defined as a source that `` by nature of its construction and design , is likely to protect the source from outside contamination , in particular from faecal matter '' ) and 12 per cent used improved sanitation facilities ( defined as facilities that `` likely hygienically separates human excreta from human contact '' but not including facilities shared with other households or open to public use ) .
===Women===
Women and men have equality before the law .
The government signed the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women ( CEDAW ) in 1985.
Nearly 3 out of ten females reported having experienced sexual violence before the age of 18.
The prevalence of female genital mutilation has decreased .
School girls are reinstated back to school after delivery .
The Police Force administration strives to separate the Gender Desks from normal police operations to enhance confidentiality of the processing of women victims of abuse .
Most of the abuses and violence against women and children occurs at the family level .
The Constitution of Tanzania requires that women to constitute at least 30 % of all elected members of National Assembly ( Tanzania ) . The gender differences in education and training have implications later in life of these women and girls .
Unemployment is higher for females than for males . The right of a female employee to maternity leave is guaranteed in labour law .
==Culture==
===Literature===
Tanzania 's literary culture is primarily oral . Major oral literary forms include folktales , poems , riddles , proverbs , and songs . The greatest part of Tanzania 's recorded oral literature is in Swahili , even though each of the country 's languages has its own oral tradition . The country 's oral literature has been declining because of the breakdown of the multigenerational social structure , making transmission of oral literature more difficult , and because increasing modernisation has been accompanied by the devaluation of oral literature .
Books in Tanzania are often expensive and hard to come by . Most Tanzanian literature is in Swahili or English . Major figures in Tanzanian written literature include Shaaban Robert ( considered the father of Swahili literature ) , Muhammed Saley Farsy , Faraji Katalambulla , Adam Shafi Adam , Muhammed Said Abdulla , Said Ahmed Mohammed Khamis , Mohamed Suleiman Mohamed , Euphrase Kezilahabi , Gabriel Ruhumbika , Ebrahim Hussein , May Balisidya , Fadhy Mtanga , Abdulrazak Gurnah , and Penina Muhando Penina O. Mlama .
===Painting and sculpture===
Two Tanzanian art styles have achieved international recognition . The Tingatinga ( painting ) school of painting , founded by Edward Said Tingatinga , consists of brightly coloured enamel paintings on canvas , generally depicting people , animals , or daily life . After Tingatinga 's death in 1972 , other artists adopted and developed his style , with the genre now being the most important tourist-oriented style in East Africa .
Historically , there were limited opportunities for formal European art training in Tanzania and many aspiring Tanzanian artists left the country to pursue their vocation .
===Sports===
Association football is very popular throughout the country . The most popular Tanzanian Premier League in Dar es Salaam are the Young Africans F.C . and Simba S.C . The Tanzania Football Federation is the governing body for football in the country .
Other popular sports include basketball , netball , boxing , volleyball , athletics ( sport ) , and rugby union . The National Sports Council also known as Baraza la Michezo la Taifa is the governing body for sports in the country under the Ministry of Information , Youth , Sports and Culture .
Online betting website PariMatch was launched in 2017 in Tanzania .
===Cinema===
Tanzania has a popular film industry known as `` Bongo Movie '' . The music industry is known as `` Bongo Flava '' which is in itself also a niche genre of music in Tanzania .

Papua New Guinea ( PNG ; , ; Papua Niugini ; Papua Niu Gini ; Op Deudai ) , officially the Independent State of Papua New Guinea ( Independen Stet bilong Papua Niugini ; Independen Stet bilong Papua Niu Gini ) , is a country in Oceania that occupies the eastern half of the island of New Guinea and its offshore islands in Melanesia , a region of the southwestern Pacific Ocean north of Australia . Its capital , located along its southeastern coast , is Port Moresby . The Western New Guinea forms the Indonesian provinces of Papua ( province ) and West Papua ( province ) . It is the world 's third largest List of island countries with .
At the national level , after being ruled by three external powers since 1884 , Papua New Guinea established its sovereignty in 1975 . This followed nearly 60 years of Australian administration , which started during World War ; I . It became an independent Commonwealth realm in 1975 with Elizabeth ; II as its Monarchy of Papua New Guinea . It also became a member of the Commonwealth of Nations in its own right .
Papua New Guinea is one of the most culturally diverse countries in the world . As of 2019 , it is also the most rural , as only 13.25 % of its people live in urban centres . There are 851 known Languages of Papua New Guinea , of which 11 now have no known speakers . Most of the population of more than 8,000,000 people live in Customary land , which are as diverse as the languages . The country is one of the world 's least explored , culturally and geographically . It is known to have numerous groups of Uncontacted peoples # New Guinea , and researchers believe there are many undiscovered species of plants and animals in the interior .
The sovereign state is classified as a Developing country by the International Monetary Fund . Nearly 40 % of the population lives a self-sustainable natural lifestyle with no access to global capital . Most of the people still live in strong traditional social groups based on Subsistence agriculture . Their social lives combine traditional religion with modern practices , including primary education . These societies and clans are explicitly acknowledged by the Papua New Guinea Constitution , which expresses the wish for `` traditional villages and communities to remain as viable units of Papua New Guinean society '' and protects their continuing importance to local and national community life . The nation is an observer state in the Association of Southeast Asian Nations ( ASEAN ) since 1976 and has filed its application for full membership status . It is a full member of the Pacific Community , the Pacific Islands Forum , and the Commonwealth of Nations .
==Etymology==
The word papua is derived from an old local term of uncertain origin . `` New Guinea '' ( Nueva Guinea ) was the name Neologism by the Spanish Empire explorer Yigo Ortiz de Retez . In 1545 , he noted the resemblance of the people to those he had earlier seen along the Guinea ( region ) coast of Africa . Guinea , in its turn , is etymologically derived from the Portuguese language Guin . The name is one of several Toponymy sharing similar Place name origins , ultimately meaning `` land of the blacks '' or similar meanings , in reference to the dark skin of the inhabitants .
== History ==
Archaeological evidence indicates that humans first arrived in Papua New Guinea around 42,000 to 45,000 years ago . They were descendants of migrants out of Africa , in one of the early waves of human migration .
Agriculture was independently developed in the New Guinea highlands around 7000 BC , making it one of the few areas in the world where people independently domesticated plants . A major migration of Austronesian languages Austronesian-speaking peoples to coastal regions of New Guinea took place around 500 BC . This has been correlated with the introduction of pottery , pigs , and certain fishing techniques .
In the 18th century , traders brought the sweet potato to New Guinea , where it was adopted and became a staple food . Portuguese discoveries had obtained it from South America and introduced it to the Maluku Islands . The far higher crop yields from sweet potato gardens radically transformed traditional agriculture and societies . Sweet potato largely supplanted the previous staple , taro , and resulted in a significant increase in population in the highlands .
Although by the late 20th century [ and cannibalism ] had been practically eradicated , in the past they were practised in many parts of the country as part of rituals related to warfare and taking in enemy spirits or powers . In 1901 , on [ [ Goaribari Island in the Gulf of Papua , missionary Harry Moore Dauncey found 10,000 skulls in the island 's long houses , a demonstration of past practices . According to Marianna Torgovnick , writing in 1991 , `` The most fully documented instances of cannibalism as a social institution come from New Guinea , where head-hunting and ritual cannibalism survived , in certain isolated areas , into the Fifties , Sixties , and Seventies , and still leave traces within certain social groups . ''
===European encounters===
Little was known in Europe about the island until the 19th century , although Portuguese and Spanish explorers , such as Dom Jorge de Menezes and Yigo Ortiz de Retez , had encountered it as early as the 16th century . Traders from Southeast Asia had visited New Guinea beginning 5,000 years ago to collect bird-of-paradise plumes .
===Colonialism===
The country 's dual name results from its complex administrative history before independence . In the nineteenth century , German Empire ruled the northern half of the country for some decades , beginning in 1884 , as a colony named German New Guinea . In 1914 after the outbreak of World War I , Australian forces Australian occupation of German New Guinea and occupied it throughout the war . After the war , in which Germany and the Central Powers were defeated , the League of Nations authorised Australia to administer this area as a League of Nations mandate territory that became the Territory of New Guinea .
The southern half of the country had been colonised in 1884 by the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland as Territory of Papua . With the Papua Act 1905 , the UK transferred this territory to the newly formed Commonwealth of Australia , which took on its administration . Additionally , from 1905 , British New Guinea was renamed as the Territory of Papua . In contrast to establishing an Australian mandate in former German New Guinea , the League of Nations determined that Papua was an external territory of the Australian Commonwealth ; as a matter of law it remained a British possession . The difference in legal status meant that until 1949 , Papua and New Guinea had entirely separate administrations , both controlled by Australia . These conditions contributed to the complexity of organising the country 's post-independence legal system .
===World War II===
During World War II , the New Guinea campaign ( 19421945 ) was one of the major military campaigns and conflicts between Japan and the Allies of World War II . Approximately 216,000 Japanese , Australian , and U.S. servicemen died . After World War II and the victory of the Allies , the two territories were combined into the Territory of Papua and New Guinea . This was later referred to as `` Papua New Guinea '' .
The natives of Papua appealed to the United Nations for oversight and independence . The nation established independence from Australia on 16 September 1975 , becoming a Commonwealth realm , continuing to share Queen Elizabeth II as its head of state . It maintains close ties with Australia , which continues to be its largest aid donor . Papua New Guinea was admitted to membership in the United Nations on 10 October 1975.
===Bougainville===
A ; secessionist revolt in 197576 on Bougainville Island resulted in an eleventh-hour modification of the draft Law of Papua New Guinea to allow for Bougainville and the other eighteen districts to have quasi-federal status as provinces . A renewed Bougainville Civil War started in 1988 and claimed 20,000 lives until it was resolved in 1997 . Bougainville had been the primary mining region of the country , generating 40 % of the national budget . The native peoples felt they were bearing the adverse environmental effects of the mining , which contaminated the land , water and air , without gaining a fair share of the profits .
The government and rebels negotiated a peace agreement that established the Bougainville Autonomous District and Province . The autonomous Bougainville elected Joseph Kabui as president in 2005 , who served until his death in 2008 . He was succeeded by his deputy John Tabinaman as acting president while an election to fill the unexpired term was organised . James Tanis won that election in December 2008 and served until the inauguration of John Momis , the winner of the 2010 elections . As part of the current peace settlement , a non-binding 2019 Bougainvillean independence referendum was held , between 23 November and 7 December 2019 . The referendum question was a choice between greater autonomy within Papua New Guinea and full independence for Bougainville , and voters voted overwhelmingly ( 98.31 % ) for independence .
===Chinese minority===
Numerous Chinese have worked and lived in Papua New Guinea , establishing Chinese-majority communities . Chinese merchants became established in the islands before European exploration . Anti-Chinese sentiment Anti-Chinese rioting involving tens of thousands of people broke out in May 2009 . The initial spark was a fight between Overseas Chinese and indigenous workers at a nickel factory under construction by a Chinese company . Native resentment against Chinese ownership of numerous small businesses and their commercial monopoly in the islands led to the rioting .
===Earthquakes===
From March to April 2018 , 2018 Papua New Guinea earthquake hit Papua New Guinea , causing various damage . Various nations from Oceania , Australia , the Philippines and Timor-Leste immediately sent aid to the country .
==Government and politics==
Papua New Guinea is a Commonwealth realm with Elizabeth II as Monarchy of Papua New Guinea . The constitutional convention , which prepared the draft constitution , and Australia , the outgoing metropolitan power , had thought that Papua New Guinea would not remain a monarchy . The founders , however , considered that imperial honours had a cachet . The monarch is represented by the Governor-General of Papua New Guinea , currently Bob Dadae . Papua New Guinea ( and the Solomon Islands ) are unusual among Commonwealth realms in that governors-general are elected by the legislature , rather than chosen by the executive branch .
The Prime Minister of Papua New Guinea heads the Cabinet of Papua New Guinea , which consists of 31 members of Parliament from the ruling coalition , which make up the government . The current prime minister is James Marape . The unicameralism National Parliament of Papua New Guinea has 111 seats , of which 22 are occupied by the governors of the 22 provinces and the National Capital District ( Papua New Guinea ) . Candidates for members of parliament are voted upon when the prime minister asks the governor-general to call a national election , a maximum of five years after the previous national election .
In the early years of independence , the instability of the party system led to frequent motion of no confidence in parliament , with resulting changes of the government , but with referral to the electorate , through national elections only occurring every five years . In recent years , successive governments have passed legislation preventing such votes sooner than 18 months after a national election and within 12 months of the next election . In 2012 , the first two ( of three ) readings were passed to prevent votes of no confidence occurring within the first 30 months . This restriction on votes of no confidence has arguably resulted in greater stability , although perhaps at a cost of reducing the accountability of the executive branch of government .
Elections in PNG attract numerous candidates . After independence in 1975 , members were elected by the First-past-the-post voting first-past-the-post system , with winners frequently gaining less than 15 % of the vote . Electoral reforms in 2001 introduced the Limited Preferential Vote system ( LPV ) , a version of the instant-runoff voting . The 2007 Papua New Guinean general election was the first to be conducted using LPV .
Under a 2002 amendment , the leader of the party winning the largest number of seats in the election is invited by the governor-general to form the government , if she can muster the necessary majority in parliament . The process of forming such a coalition in PNG , where parties do not have much ideology , involves considerable `` horse-trading '' right up until the last moment . Peter O'Neill emerged as Papua New Guinea 's prime minister after the July 2012 election , and formed a government with Leo Dion , the former Governor of East New Britain Province , as deputy prime minister .
In 2011 there was a 20112012 Papua New Guinean constitutional crisis between the parliament-elect Prime Minister , Peter O'Neill ( voted into office by a large majority of MPs ) , and Michael Somare , who was deemed by the supreme court to retain office . The stand-off between parliament and the supreme court continued until the July 2012 national elections , with legislation passed effectively removing the chief justice and subjecting the supreme court members to greater control by the legislature , as well as a series of other laws passed , for example limiting the age for a prime minister . The confrontation reached a peak , with the deputy prime minister entering the supreme court during a hearing , escorted by police , ostensibly to arrest the chief justice . There was strong pressure among some MPs to defer the national elections for a further six months to one year , although their powers to do that were highly questionable . The parliament-elect prime minister and other cooler-headed MPs carried the votes for the writs for the new election to be issued , slightly late , but for the election itself to occur on time , thereby avoiding a continuation of the constitutional crisis .
In May 2019 , O'Neill resigned as prime minister and was replaced through a vote of Parliament by James Marape . Davis Steven was appointed deputy prime minister .
=== Law ===
The unicameral Parliament enacts legislation in the same manner as in other Commonwealth realms that use the Westminster system of government . The cabinet collectively agree government policy , then the relevant minister introduces bills to Parliament , depending on which government department is responsible for implementation of a particular law . Back bench members of parliament can also introduce bills . Parliament debates bills , and ( section 110.1 of the Constitution ) they become enacted laws when the Speaker certifies that Parliament has passed them . There is no Royal assent .
All ordinary statutes enacted by Parliament must be consistent with the Constitution . The courts have jurisdiction to rule on the constitutionality of statutes , both in disputes before them and on a reference where there is no dispute but only an abstract question of law . Unusually among developing countries , the judicial branch of government in Papua New Guinea has remained remarkably independent , and successive executive governments have continued to respect its authority .
The `` underlying law '' ( Papua New Guinea 's common law ) consists of principles and rules of common law and equity in English common law as it stood on 16 September 1975 ( the date of independence ) , and thereafter the decisions of PNG 's own courts . The courts are directed by the Constitution and , latterly , the Underlying Law Act , to take note of the `` custom '' of traditional communities . They are to determine which customs are common to the whole country and may be declared also to be part of the underlying law . In practice , this has proved difficult and has been largely neglected . Statutes are largely adapted from overseas jurisdictions , primarily Australia and England . Advocacy in the courts follows the adversarial pattern of other common-law countries . This national court system , used in towns and cities , is supported by a village court system in the more remote areas . The law underpinning the village courts is 'customary law ' .
=== Foreign policy ===
Papua New Guinea is a member of the Commonwealth of Nations , Pacific Community , Pacific Islands Forum , and the Melanesian Spearhead Group ( MSG ) of countries . It was accorded observer status within ASEAN in 1976 , followed later by special observer status in 1981 . It is also a member of Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation and an Organisation of African , Caribbean and Pacific States country , associated with the European Union .
Papua New Guinea supported Indonesia 's control of Western New Guinea : the focus of the Papua conflict where numerous human rights violations have reportedly been committed by the Indonesian security forces . In September 2017 , Papua New Guinea rejected the United Liberation Movement for West Papua in the UN General Assembly .
=== Military ===
The Papua New Guinea Defence Force is the military organisation responsible for the defence of Papua New Guinea . It consists of three wings . The Land Element , a land force consisting of the Royal Pacific Islands Regiment , a small special forces unit , a battalion of engineers , and three other small units primarily dealing with signals and health , as well as a military academy , is concerned with defence of the nation on land . The Air Element is a small aircraft squadron ; its purpose is transportation for the other military wings . The Maritime Element is a small navy consisting of four Pacific-class patrol boat Pacific-class patrol boats , three ex-Australian Balikpapan-class landing craft heavy Balikpapan-class landing craft , and one Guardian-class patrol boat . One of the landing craft is used as a training ship . Three more Guardian-class patrol boats are under construction in Australia , to replace the old Pacific-class vessels . The main tasks of the Maritime Element are patrol of inshore waters and transport of the Land Element . Papua New Guinea has such a large exclusive economic zone that patrols by the small Pacific-class patrol boats , which are often unserviceable because of underfunding , are ineffective , so the Maritime Element is heavily reliant on satellite imagery for surveillance of its waters . This problem will be partially corrected when all of the larger Guardian-class patrol boats enter service .
=== Crime and human rights ===
Papua New Guinea is often ranked as likely the worst place in the world for violence against women . A 2013 study in The Lancet found that 27 % of men on Bougainville Island reported having raped a non-partner , while 14.1 % reported having committed gang rape . According to UNICEF , nearly half of reported rape victims are under 15 years old , and 13 % are under 7 years old . A report by ChildFund Australia , citing former Parliamentarian Dame Carol Kidu , claimed 50 % of those seeking medical help after rape are under 16 , 25 % are under 12 , and 10 % are under 8 . Under Dame Carol 's term as Minister for Community Development , Parliament passed the Family Protection Act ( 2013 ) and the Lukautim Pikini Act ( 2015 ) , although the Family Protection Regulation was not approved until 2017 , delaying its application in the Courts .
The 1971 Sorcery Act imposed a penalty of up to 2 years in prison for the practice of black magic `` black '' magic , until the act was repealed in 2013 . An estimated 50150 alleged Witchcraft are Witch-hunt each year in Papua New Guinea . A Sorcery and Witchcraft Accusation Related National Action Plan ( SNAP ) was approved by the Government in 2015 , although funding and application has been deficient . There are also no protections given to LGBT rights in Papua New Guinea LGBT citizens in the country ] . [ [ LGBT rights in Papua New Guinea are prohibited by law in Papua New Guinea .
===Royal PNG Constabulary===
The Royal Papua New Guinea Constabulary has been troubled in recent years by infighting , political interference and corruption . It was recognised from early after Independence ( and hitherto ) that a national police force alone could never have the capacity to administer law and order across the country , and that it would also require effective local level systems of policing and enforcement , notably the village court magesterial service . The weaknesses of police capacity , poor working conditions and recommendations to address them were the subject of the 2004 Royal PNG Constabulary Administrative Review to the Minister for Internal Security .
In 2011 , Commissioner for Police Anthony Wagambie took the unusual step of asking the public to report police asking for payments for performing their duties .
In September 2020 , Minister for Police Bryan Jared Kramer launched a broadside on Facebook against his own police department , which was subsequently reported in the international media . In the post , Kramer accused the Royal PNG Constabulary of widespread corruption , claiming that `` Senior officers based in Police Headquarters in Port Moresby were stealing from their own retired officers  pension funds . They were implicated in organised crime , drug syndicates , smuggling firearms , stealing fuel , insurance scams , and even misusing police allowances . They misused tens of millions of kina allocated for police housing , resources , and welfare . We also uncovered many cases of senior officers facilitating the theft of Police land . '' Commissioner for Police David Manning , in a separate statement , said that his force included  criminals in uniform  .
=== Administrative divisions ===
Papua New Guinea is divided into four List of regions of Papua New Guinea , which are not the primary administrative divisions but are quite significant in many aspects of government , commercial , sporting and other activities . The nation has 22 Provinces of Papua New Guinea-level divisions : twenty provinces , the Autonomous Region of Bougainville and the National Capital District ( Papua New Guinea ) . Each province is divided into one or more Districts of Papua New Guinea , which in turn are divided into one or more Local-level governments of Papua New Guinea Local-Level Government areas . Provinces are the primary administrative divisions of the country . Provincial governments are branches of the national government as Papua New Guinea is not a federation of provinces . The province-level divisions are as follows :
{
# Central Province ( Papua New Guinea )
# Chimbu Province ( Simbu )
# Eastern Highlands Province
# East New Britain Province
# East Sepik Province
# Enga Province
# Gulf Province
# Madang Province
# Manus Province
# Milne Bay Province
# Morobe Province
New Ireland Province
Northern ( Oro Province )
Autonomous Region of Bougainville Bougainville ( autonomous region )
Southern Highlands Province
Western Province ( Papua New Guinea ) ( Fly )
Western Highlands Province
West New Britain Province
Sandaun Province West Sepik ( Sandaun )
National Capital District ( Papua New Guinea ) ( Port Moresby )
Hela Province
Jiwaka Province

}
In 2009 , Parliament approved the creation of two additional provinces : Hela Province , consisting of part of the existing Southern Highlands Province , and Jiwaka Province , formed by dividing Western Highlands Province . Jiwaka and Hela officially became separate provinces on 17 May 2012 . The declaration of Hela and Jiwaka is a result of the largest liquefied natural gas project in the country that is situated in both provinces . The government set 23 November 2019 as the voting date for a non-binding independence referendum in the Autonomous Region of Bougainville . In December 2019 , the autonomous region voted overwhelmingly for independence , with 97.7 % voting in favor of obtaining full independence and around 1.7 % voting in favor of greater autonomy .
== Geography ==
At , Papua New Guinea is the world 's 54th largest country and the 3rd largest List of island countries . Papua New Guinea is part of the Australasian realm , which also includes Australia , New Zealand , eastern Indonesia , and several Pacific island groups , including the Solomon Islands and Vanuatu . Including all its islands , it lies between latitudes 0 and 12S , and longitudes 140 and 160E . It has an exclusive economic zone of . The mainland of the country is the eastern half of New Guinea island , where the largest towns are also located , including Port Moresby ( capital ) and Lae ; other major islands within Papua New Guinea include New Ireland ( island ) , New Britain , Manus Island and Bougainville .
Located north of the Australian mainland , the country 's geography is diverse and , in places , extremely rugged . A spine of mountains , the New Guinea Highlands , runs the length of the island of New Guinea , forming a populous Highland region mostly covered with tropical rainforest , and the long Papuan Peninsula , known as the 'Bird 's Tail ' . Dense rainforests can be found in the lowland and coastal areas as well as very large wetland areas surrounding the Sepik and Fly River rivers . This terrain has made it difficult for the country to develop transportation infrastructure . Some areas are accessible only on foot or by aeroplane . The highest peak is Mount Wilhelm at . Papua New Guinea is surrounded by coral reefs which are under close watch , in the interests of preservation .
The country is situated on the Pacific Ring of Fire , at the point of collision of several Plate tectonics . Geologically , the island of New Guinea is a northern extension of the Indo-Australian Plate Indo-Australian tectonic plate , forming part of a single land mass which is Australia ( continent ) Australia-New Guinea ( also called Sahul or Meganesia ) . It is connected to the Australian segment by a shallow continental shelf across the Torres Strait , which in former ages lay exposed as a land bridge , particularly during ice ages when sea levels were lower than at present . As the Indo-Australian Plate ( which includes landmasses of India , Australia , and the Indian Ocean floor in between ) drifts north , it collides with the Eurasian Plate . The collision of the two plates pushed up the Himalayas , the Indonesian islands , and New Guinea 's Central Range . The Central Range is much younger and higher than the mountains of Australia , so high that it is home to rare equatorial glaciers .
There are several active volcanoes , and eruptions are frequent . Earthquakes are relatively common , sometimes accompanied by tsunamis . On 25 February 2018 , an 2018 Papua New Guinea earthquake earthquake of magnitude 7.5 and depth of 35 kilometres struck the middle of Papua New Guinea . The worst of the damage was centred around the Southern Highlands region . Papua New Guinea is one of the few regions close to the equator that experience snowfall , which occurs in the most elevated parts of the mainland .
The border between Papua New Guinea and Indonesia was confirmed by treaty with Australia before independence in 1974 . The land border comprises a segment of the 141st meridian east 141 E meridian from the north coast southwards to where it meets the Fly River flowing east , then a short curve of the river 's thalweg to where it meets the 14101'10 '' E meridian flowing west , then southwards to the south coast . The 141 E meridian formed the entire eastern boundary of Dutch New Guinea according to its 1828 annexation proclamation . Treaty of The Hague ( 1895 ) the Dutch and British agreed to a territorial exchange , bringing the entire left bank of the Fly River into British New Guinea and moving the southern border east to the Torasi Estuary . The maritime boundary with Australia was confirmed by a treaty in 1978 . In the Torres Strait it runs close to the mainland of New Guinea , keeping the adjacent North Western Torres Strait Islands ( Dauan Island , Boigu Island ( Queensland ) and Saibai Island ) under Australian sovereignty . Maritime boundaries with the Solomon Islands were confirmed by Papua New GuineaSolomon Islands Maritime Boundary Treaty .
=== Ecology ===
Many species of birds and mammals found on New Guinea have close genetic links with corresponding species found in Australia . One notable feature in common for the two landmasses is the existence of several species of marsupial mammals , including some kangaroos and Phalangeriformes , which are not found elsewhere . Papua New Guinea is a Megadiverse countries .
Many of the other islands within PNG territory , including New Britain , New Ireland , Bougainville , the Admiralty Islands , the Trobriand Islands , and the Louisiade Archipelago , were never linked to New Guinea by land bridges . As a consequence , they have their own flora and fauna ; in particular , they lack many of the land mammals and flightless birds that are common to New Guinea and Australia .
Australia and New Guinea are portions of the ancient supercontinent of Gondwana , which started to break into smaller continents in the Cretaceous period , 65130 million years ago . Australia finally broke free from Antarctica about 45 million years ago . All the Australasian lands are home to the Antarctic flora , descended from the flora of southern Gondwana , including the Pinophyta podocarpaceae and Araucaria pines , and the broad-leafed southern beech ( Nothofagus ) . These plant families are still present in Papua New Guinea . New Guinea is part of the humid tropics , and many Indomalayan realm rainforest plants spread across the narrow straits from Asia , mixing together with the old Australian and Antarctic floras .
PNG includes a number of terrestrial ecoregions :
* Admiralty Islands lowland rain forests  forested islands to the north of the mainland , home to a distinct flora .
* New Guinea Highlands
* Huon Peninsula montane rain forests
* Louisiade Archipelago rain forests
* New Britain-New Ireland lowland rain forests
* New Britain-New Ireland montane rain forests
* New Guinea mangroves
* Northern New Guinea lowland rain and freshwater swamp forests
* Northern New Guinea montane rain forests
* Solomon Islands rain forests ( includes Bougainville Island and Buka )
* Southeastern Papuan rain forests
* Southern New Guinea freshwater swamp forests
* Southern New Guinea lowland rain forests
* Trobriand Islands rain forests
* Trans-Fly savanna and grasslands
* Central Range sub-alpine grasslands
Three new species of mammals were discovered in the forests of Papua New Guinea by an Australian-led expedition in the early 2010s . A small wallaby , a large-eared mouse and shrew-like marsupial were discovered . The expedition was also successful in capturing photographs and video footage of some other rare animals such as the Tenkile tree kangaroo and the Weimang tree kangaroo . Nearly one quarter of Papua New Guinea 's rainforests were damaged or destroyed between 1972 and 2002 . Papua New Guinea had a Forest Landscape Integrity Index mean score of 8.84/10 , ranking it 17th globally out of 172 countries . Mangrove swamps stretch along the coast , and in the inland it is inhabited by nipa palm ( Nypa fruticans ) , and deeper in the inland the sago palm tree inhabits areas in the valleys of larger rivers . Trees such as oaks , red cedars , pines , beeches are becoming predominantly present in the uplands above 3,300 feet . Papua New Guinea is rich in various species of reptiles , indigenous freshwater fish and birds , but it is almost devoid of large mammals .
=== Climate ===
The climate on the island is essentially tropical , but it varies by region . The maximum mean temperature in the lowlands is 30 to 32  C , and the minimum 23-24  C. In the highlands above 2100 meters , colder conditions prevail and night frosts are common there , while the daytime temperature exceeds 22 C , regardless of the season .
== Economy ==
Papua New Guinea is richly endowed with natural resources , including mineral and renewable resources , such as forests , marine ( including a large portion of the world 's major tuna stocks ) , and in some parts agriculture . The rugged terrainincluding high mountain ranges and valleys , swamps and islandsand high cost of developing infrastructure , combined with other factors ( including law and order problems in some centres and the system of customary land title ) makes it difficult for outside developers . Local developers are handicapped by years of deficient investment in education , health , and access to finance . Agriculture , for subsistence and cash crops , provides a livelihood for 85 % of the population and continues to provide some 30 % of GDP . Mineral deposits , including gold , oil , and copper , account for 72 % of export earnings . Elaeis guineensis production has grown steadily over recent years ( largely from estates and with extensive outgrower output ) , with palm oil now the main agricultural export . Coffee remains the major export crop ( produced largely in the Highlands provinces ) ; followed by cocoa bean and coconut oil/copra from the coastal areas , each largely produced by smallholders ; tea , produced on estates ; and rubber . The Iagifu/Hedinia Field was discovered in 1986 in the Papuan fold and thrust belt .
Former Prime Minister Sir Mekere Morauta tried to restore integrity to state institutions , stabilise the Papua New Guinean kina , restore stability to the national budget , privatise public enterprises where appropriate , and ensure ongoing peace on Bougainville following the 1997 agreement which ended Bougainville 's secessionist unrest . The Morauta government had considerable success in attracting international support , specifically gaining the backing of the International Monetary Fund ( IMF ) and the World Bank in securing development assistance loans .
As of 2019 , PNG 's real GDP growth rate was 3.8 % , with an inflation rate of 4.3 % This economic growth has been primarily attributed to strong commodity prices , particularly mineral but also agricultural , with the high demand for mineral products largely sustained even during the crisis by the buoyant Asian markets , Mining in Papua New Guinea and by a buoyant outlook and the construction phase for natural gas exploration , production , and exportation in liquefied form ( liquefied natural gas or `` LNG '' ) by LNG carrier , all of which will require multibillion-dollar investments ( exploration , production wells , pipelines , storage , liquefaction plants , port terminals , LNG tanker ships ) .
The first major gas project was the PNG LNG joint venture . ExxonMobil is operator of the joint venture , also comprising PNG company Oil Search , Santos Limited , Kumul Petroleum Holdings ( Papua New Guinea 's national oil and gas company ) , JXTG Holdings , the PNG government 's Mineral Resources Development Company and Petromin Corporation . The project is an integrated development that includes gas production and processing facilities in the Hela Province , Southern Highlands Province and Western Province ( Papua New Guinea ) Provinces of Papua New Guinea , including liquefaction and storage facilities ( located northwest of Port Moresby ) with capacity of 6.9 million tonnes per year . There are over of pipelines connecting the facilities . It is the largest private-sector investment in the history of PNG . A second major project is based on initial rights held by the French oil and gas major Total S.A. and the U.S. company InterOil Corp. ( IOC ) , which have partly combined their assets after Total agreed in December 2013 to purchase 61.3 % of IOC 's Antelope and Elk gas field rights , with the plan to develop them starting in 2016 , including the construction of a liquefaction plant to allow export of LNG . Total S.A. has separately another joint operating agreement with Oil Search .
Further gas and mineral projects are proposed ( including the large Wafi-Golpu copper-gold mine ) , with extensive exploration ongoing across the country .
The PNG government 's long-term Vision 2050 and shorter-term policy documents , including the 2013 Budget and the 2014 Responsible Sustainable Development Strategy , emphasise the need for a more diverse economy , based upon sustainable industries and avoiding the effects of Dutch disease from major resource extraction projects undermining other industries , as has occurred in many countries experiencing oil or other mineral booms , notably in Western Africa , undermining much of their agriculture sector , manufacturing and tourism , and with them broad-based employment prospects . Measures have been taken to mitigate these effects , including through the establishment of a sovereign wealth fund , partly to stabilise revenue and expenditure flows , but much will depend upon the readiness to make real reforms to effective use of revenue , tackling rampant corruption and empowering households and businesses to access markets , services and develop a more buoyant economy , with lower costs , especially for small to medium-size enterprises . One major project conducted through the PNG Department for Community Development suggested that other pathways to sustainable development should be considered .
The Institute of National Affairs , a PNG independent policy think tank , provides a report on the business and investment environment of Papua New Guinea every five years , based upon a survey of large and small , local and overseas companies , highlighting law and order problems and corruption , as the worst impediments , followed by the poor state of transport , power and communications infrastructure .
=== Land tenure ===
The PNG legislature has enacted laws in which a type of tenure called `` Aboriginal title customary land title ] '' is recognised , meaning that the traditional lands of the [ [ indigenous peoples have some legal basis to inalienable tenure . This customary land notionally covers most of the usable land in the country ( some 97 % of total land area ) ; alienated land is either held privately under state lease or is government land . Freehold title ( also known as fee simple ) can only be held by Papua New Guinean citizens .
Only some 3 % of the land of Papua New Guinea is in private hands ; this is privately held under 99-year state lease , or it is held by the State . There is virtually no freehold title ; the few existing freeholds are automatically converted to state lease when they are transferred between vendor and purchaser . Unalienated land is owned under customary title by traditional landowners . The precise nature of the seisin varies from one culture to another . Many writers portray land as in the communal ownership of traditional clans ; however , closer studies usually show that the smallest portions of land whose ownership can not be further divided are held by the individual heads of extended families and their descendants or their descendants alone if they have recently died .
This is a matter of vital importance because a problem of economic development is identifying the membership of customary landowning groups and the owners . Disputes between mining and forestry companies and landowner groups often devolve on the issue of whether the companies entered into contractual relations for the use of land with the true owners . Customary propertyusually land can not be devised by will . It can only be inherited according to the custom of the deceased 's people . The Lands Act was amended in 2010 along with the Land Group Incorporation Act , intended to improve the management of state land , mechanisms for dispute resolution over land , and to enable customary landowners to be better able to access finance and possible partnerships over portions of their land , if they seek to develop it for urban or rural economic activities . The Land Group Incorporation Act requires more specific identification of the customary landowners than hitherto and their more specific authorisation before any land arrangements are determined ; ( a major issue in recent years has been a land grab , using , or rather misusing , the Lease-Leaseback provision under the Land Act , notably using 'Special Agricultural and Business Leases ' ( SABLs ) to acquire vast tracts of customary land , purportedly for agricultural projects , but in an almost all cases as a back-door mechanism for securing tropical forest resources for loggingcircumventing the more exacting requirements of the Forest Act , for securing Timber Permits ( which must comply with sustainability requirements and be competitively secured , and with the customary landowners approval ) . Following a national outcry , these SABLs have been subject to a Commission of Inquiry , established in mid-2011 , for which the report is still awaited for initial presentation to the Prime Minister and Parliament .

Papua New Guinea is one of the most Homogeneity and heterogeneity nations in the world with an estimated 8.95 million inhabitants as of 2020 . There are hundreds of ethnic groups indigenous to Papua New Guinea , the majority being from the group known as Papuan people , whose ancestors arrived in the New Guinea region tens of thousands of years ago . The other indigenous peoples are Austronesian peoples , their ancestors having arrived in the region less than four thousand years ago .
There are also numerous people from other parts of the world now resident , including Chinese people in Papua New Guinea , Europeans , Australians , Indonesians , Filipinos , Polynesians , and Micronesians ( the last four belonging to the Austronesian family ) . Around 40,000 expatriates , mostly from Australia and China , were living in Papua New Guinea in 1975 . 20,000 people from Australia currently live in Papua New Guinea . They represent 0.25 % of the total population of Papua New Guinea .
=== Urbanisation ===
According to the CIA World Factbook ( 2018 ) , Papua New Guinea has the second lowest urban population percentage in the world , with 13.2 % , only behind Burundi . The Geography of Papua New Guinea and Economy of Papua New Guinea of Papua New Guinea are the main factors behind the low percentage . Papua New Guinea has an urbanisation rate of 2.51 % , measured as the projected change in urban population from 2015 to 2020.
=== Languages ===
Papua New Guinea has more languages than any other country , with over 820 indigenous languages , representing 12 % of the world 's total , but most have fewer than 1,000 speakers . With an average of only 7,000 speakers per language , Papua New Guinea has a greater density of languages than any other nation on earth except Vanuatu . The most widely spoken indigenous language is Enga language , with about 200,000 speakers , followed by Melpa language and Huli language . Indigenous languages are classified into two large groups , Austronesian languages and non-Austronesian , or Papuan languages , languages . There are four languages in Papua New Guinea with some statutory recognition : English , Tok Pisin , Hiri Motu , and , since 2015 , sign language ( which in practice means Papua New Guinean Sign Language ) .
English is the language of government and the education system , but it is not spoken widely . The primary lingua franca of the country is Tok Pisin ( commonly known in English as New Guinean Pidgin or Melanesian Pidgin ) , in which much of the debate in Parliament is conducted , many information campaigns and advertisements are presented , and a national weekly newspaper , Wantok Niuspepa , is published . The only area where Tok Pisin is not prevalent is the southern region of Papua , where people often use the third official language , Hiri Motu . Although it lies in the Papua region , Port Moresby has a highly diverse population which primarily uses Tok Pisin , and to a lesser extent English , with Motu spoken as the indigenous language in outlying villages .
=== Health ===
Life expectancy in Papua New Guinea at birth was 64 years for men in 2016 and 68 for women . Government expenditure health in 2014 accounted for 9.5 % of total government spending , with total health expenditure equating to 4.3 % of GDP . There were five physicians per 100,000 people in the early 2000s . The 2010 maternal mortality rate per 100,000 births for Papua New Guinea was 250 . This is compared with 311.9 in 2008 and 476.3 in 1990 . The under-5 mortality rate , per 1,000 births is 69 and the neonatal mortality as a percentage of under-5s ' mortality is 37 . In Papua New Guinea , the number of midwives per 1,000 live births is 1 and the lifetime risk of death for pregnant women is 1 in 94.
=== Religion ===
The government and judiciary uphold the constitutional right to freedom of speech , thought , and belief , and no legislation to curb those rights has been adopted . The 2011 census found that 95.6 % of citizens identified themselves as Christianity , 1.4 % were not Christian , and 3.1 % gave no answer . Virtually no respondent identified as being nonreligious . Religious syncretism is high , with many citizens combining their Christian faith with some traditional indigenous religious practices . Most Christians in Papua New Guinea are Protestantism , constituting roughly 70 % of the total population . They are mostly represented by the Evangelical Lutheran Church of Papua New Guinea , the Seventh-day Adventist Church , diverse Pentecostalism denominations , the United Church in Papua New Guinea and Solomon Islands , the Evangelical Alliance Papua New Guinea , and the Anglican Church of Papua New Guinea . Apart from Protestants , there is a notable Catholic Church minority with approximately 25 % of the population .
There are approximately 2,000 Islam in Papua New Guinea . The majority belong to the Sunni Islam group , while a small number are Ahmadiyya . Non-traditional Christian churches and non-Christian religious groups are active throughout the country . The Papua New Guinea Council of Churches has stated that both Muslim and Confucian missionaries are highly active . Traditional religions are often Animism . Some also tend to have elements of veneration of the dead , though generalisation is suspect given the extreme heterogeneity of Melanesian societies . Prevalent among traditional tribes is the belief in masalai , or evil spirits , which are blamed for `` poisoning '' people , causing calamity and death , and the practice of puripuri ( Maleficium ( sorcery ) ) .
The first Bah   in PNG was Violete Hoenke who arrived at Admiralty Island , from Australia , in 1954 . The PNG Bah   community grew so quickly that in 1969 a National Spiritual Assembly ( administrative council ) was elected . As of 2020 there are over 30,000 members of the Bah   Faith in PNG . In 2012 the decision was made to erect the first Bah   House of Worship in PNG . Its design is that of a woven basket , a common feature of all groups and cultures in PNG . It is , therefore , hoped to be a symbol for the entire country . Its nine entrances are inspired by the design of Haus Tambaran ( Spirit House ) . Construction began in Port Moresby in 2018.
== Culture ==
It is estimated that more than one thousand cultural groups exist in Papua New Guinea . Because of this diversity , many styles of cultural expression have emerged . Each group has created its own expressive forms in art , dance , weaponry , costumes , singing , music , architecture and much more . Most of these cultural groups have their own language . People typically live in villages that rely on subsistence farming . In some areas people hunt and collect wild plants ( such as Yam ( vegetable ) and karuka ) to supplement their diets . Those who become skilled at hunting , farming and fishing earn a great deal of respect .
Seashells are no longer the currency of Papua New Guinea , as they were in some regionssea shells were abolished as currency in 1933 . This tradition is still present in local customs . In some cultures , to get a bride , a groom must bring a certain number of golden-edged clam shells as a bride price . In other regions , the bride price is paid in lengths of shell money , pigs , Cassowary or cash . Elsewhere , it is brides who traditionally pay a dowry .
People of the highlands engage in colourful local rituals that are called `` sing sings '' . They paint themselves and dress up with feathers , pearls and animal skins to represent birds , trees or mountain spirits . Sometimes an important event , such as a legendary battle , is enacted at such a musical festival .
The country possesses one UNESCO World Heritage site , the Kuk Swamp , which was inscribed in 2008 . The country , however , has no elements inscribed yet in the UNESCO Intangible Cultural Heritage Lists , despite having one of the widest array of intangible cultural heritage elements in the world .
=== Sport ===
Sport is an important part of Papua New Guinean culture , and rugby league is by far the most popular sport . In a nation where communities are far apart and many people live at a minimal subsistence level , rugby league has been described as a replacement for tribal warfare as a way of explaining the local enthusiasm for the game . Many Papua New Guineans have become celebrities by representing their country or playing in an overseas professional league . Even Australian rugby league players who have played in the annual State of Origin series , which is celebrated every year in PNG , are among the most well-known people throughout the nation . State of Origin is a highlight of the year for most Papua New Guineans , although the support is so passionate that many people have died over the years in violent clashes supporting their team . The Papua New Guinea national rugby league team usually plays against the Australian Prime Minister 's XIII ( a selection of NRL players ) each year , normally in Port Moresby .
Although not as popular , Australian rules football is more significant in another way , as Papua New Guinea national Australian rules football team is ranked second , only after Australia . Other major sports which have a part in the Papua New Guinea sporting landscape are association football , rugby union , basketball and , in eastern Papua , cricket .
== Education ==
A large proportion of the population is Literacy , with women predominating in this area . Much of the education in PNG is provided by church institutions . This includes 500 schools of the Evangelical Lutheran Church of Papua New Guinea . Papua New Guinea has six universities apart from other major tertiary institutions . The two founding universities are the University of Papua New Guinea , based in the National Capital District ( Papua New Guinea ) , and the Papua New Guinea University of Technology , based outside of Lae , in Morobe Province .
The four other universities which were once colleges were established recently after gaining government recognition . These are the University of Goroka in the Eastern Highlands province , Divine Word University ( run by the Catholic Church 's Society of the Divine Word ) in Madang Province , Papua New Guinea University of Natural Resources and Environment in East New Britain Province and Pacific Adventist University ( run by the Seventh-day Adventist Church ) in the National Capital District .
== Science and technology ==
Papua New Guinea 's National Vision 2050 was adopted in 2009 . This has led to the establishment of the Research , Science and Technology Council . At its gathering in November 2014 , the Council re-emphasised the need to focus on sustainable development through Science and technology in Pacific Island countries .
Vision 2050 's medium-term priorities are :
* emerging industrial technology for downstream processing ;
* infrastructure technology for the economic corridors ;
* knowledge-based technology ;
* science and engineering education ; and
* to reach the target of investing 5 % of GDP in research and development by 2050 . ( There is no recent data for this indicator . )
According to Thomson Reuters ' Web of Science , Papua New Guinea had the largest number of publications ( 110 ) among Pacific Island states in 2014 , followed by Fiji ( 106 ) . Nine out of ten scientific publications from Papua New Guinea focused on immunology , genetics , biotechnology and microbiology . Nine out of ten were also co-authored by scientists from other countries , mainly Australia , the United States of America , United Kingdom , Spain and Switzerland .
Forestry is an important economic resource for Papua New Guinea , but the industry uses low and semi-intensive technological inputs . As a result , product ranges are limited to sawed timber , veneer , plywood , block board , moulding , poles and posts and wood chips . Only a few limited finished products are exported . Lack of automated machinery , coupled with inadequately trained local technical personnel , are some of the obstacles to introducing automated machinery and design .
Renewable energy sources represent two-thirds of the total electricity supply . In 2015 , the Secretariat of the Pacific Community observed that , 'while Fiji , Papua New Guinea , and Samoa are leading the way with large-scale hydropower projects , there is enormous potential to expand the deployment of other renewable energy options such as solar , wind , geothermal and ocean-based energy sources ' . The European Union has funded the Renewable Energy in Pacific Island Countries Developing Skills and Capacity programme ( EPIC ) . Since its inception in 2013 , the programme has developed a master 's programme in renewable energy management at the University of Papua New Guinea and helped to establish a Centre of Renewable Energy at the same university .
Papua New Guinea is one of the 15 beneficiaries of a programme on Adapting to Climate Change and Sustainable Energy worth 37.26 million . The programme resulted from the signing of an agreement in February 2014 between the European Union and the Pacific Islands Forum Secretariat . The other beneficiaries are the Cook Islands , Fiji , Kiribati , Marshall Islands , Federated States of Micronesia , Nauru , Niue , Palau , Samoa , Solomon Islands , Timor-Leste , Tonga , Tuvalu and Vanuatu .
== Transport ==
Transport in Papua New Guinea is heavily limited by the country 's mountainous terrain . As a result , air travel is the single most important form of transport for human and high density/value freight . Airplanes made it possible to open up the country during its early colonial period . Even today the two largest cities , Port Moresby and Lae , are only directly connected by planes . Port Moresby is not linked by road to any of the other major towns , and many remote villages can only be reached by light aircraft or on foot .
Jacksons International Airport is the major international airport in Papua New Guinea , located from Port Moresby . In addition to two international airfields , Papua New Guinea has 578 airstrips , most of which are unpaved .

Uganda ( Yuganda ) , officially the Republic of Uganda ( Jamhuri ya Uganda ) , is a landlocked country in East Africa East-Central Africa . It is bordered to the east by Kenya , to the north by South Sudan , to the west by the Democratic Republic of the Congo , to the south-west by Rwanda , and to the south by Tanzania . The southern part of the country includes a substantial portion of Lake Victoria , shared with Kenya and Tanzania . Uganda is in the African Great Lakes region . Uganda also lies within the Nile and has a varied but generally a modified equatorial climate .
Uganda is named after the Buganda kingdom , which encompasses a large portion of the south of the country , including the capital Kampala . The people of Uganda were [ until 1,700 to 2,300 years ago , when Bantu languages Bantu ] -speaking populations migrated to the southern parts of the country .
Beginning in 1894 , the area was ruled as a protectorate by the UK , which established administrative law across the territory . Uganda gained independence from the UK on 9 October 1962 . The period since then has been marked by violent conflicts , including an eight-year-long [ [ military dictatorship led by Idi Amin .
The official languages are English and Swahili language , although `` any other language may be used as a medium of instruction in schools or other educational institutions or for legislative , administrative or judicial purposes as may be prescribed by law . '' Luganda , a central language , is widely spoken across the country , and several other languages are also spoken , including Lango dialect , Acholi dialect , Nyoro language , Runyankole , Rukiga , Southern Luo language and Lusoga .
Uganda 's current president is Yoweri Kaguta Museveni , who took power in January 1986 after a protracted Ugandan Bush War six-year guerrilla war . Following constitutional amendments that removed term limits for the president , he was able to stand and was elected president of Uganda in the 2011 and in the 2016 general elections .
==History==
===Pre-colonial Uganda===
The residents of Uganda were [ until 1,7002,300 years ago . Bantu languages Bantu ] -speaking populations , who were probably from central Africa , migrated to the southern parts of the country .
According to [ [ oral tradition , the Empire of Kitara covered an important part of the Great Lakes of Africa , from the northern lakes Lake Albert ( Uganda ) and Lake Kyoga to the southern lakes Lake Victoria and Lake Tanganyika . Bunyoro Bunyoro-Kitara is claimed as the antecedent of the Toro Kingdom , Ankole , and Busoga kingdoms .
Some Luo people invaded the area of Bunyoro and assimilated with the Bantu society there , establishing the Babiito dynasty of the current Omukama of Bunyoro ( ruler ) of Bunyoro-Kitara .
Arab traders moved inland from the Indian Ocean coast of East Africa in the 1830s for trade and commerce . In the late 1860s , Bunyoro in north-eastern Uganda found itself threatened from the north by Egyptian-sponsored agents , unlike the Arab traders from the East African coast who sought trade , were promoting foreign conquest . In 1869 , Khedive Ismail of Egypt of Egypt , seeking to annex the territories north of the borders of Lake Victoria and east of Lake Albert ( Africa ) and `` south of Gondokoro , '' sent a British explorer , Samuel Baker , on a military expedition to the frontiers of Northern Uganda , with the object of suppressing the slave-trade there and opening the way to commerce and civilization . The Banyoro resisted Baker , and he had to fight a desperate battle to secure his retreat . Baker regarded the resistance as an act of treachery , and he denounced the Banyoro in a book ( Ismailia  A Narrative Of The Expedition To Central Africa For The Suppression Of Slave Trade , Organised By Ismail , Khadive Of Egypt ( 1874 ) ) that was widely read in Britain . Later the British arrived in Uganda with a predisposition against Bunyoro and siding with Buganda which eventually would cost the kingdom half its territory until the `` lost counties '' restored to Bunyoro after independence .
In the 1860s , while Arabs sought influence from the north , British explorers searching for the source of the Nile arrived in Uganda . They were followed by British Anglican missionaries who arrived in the kingdom of Buganda in 1877 ( a situation which gave rise to the death of the Uganda Martyrs ) and were also followed by French Catholic missionaries in 1879 . The British government chartered the Imperial British East Africa Company ( IBEAC ) to negotiate trade agreements in the region beginning in 1888 . From 1886 , there were a series of religious wars in Buganda , initially between Muslims and Christians and then , from 1890 , between ba-Ingleza Protestants and ba-Fransa Catholics . Because of civil unrest and financial burdens , IBEAC claimed that it was unable to `` maintain their occupation '' in the region . British commercial interests were ardent to protect the trade route of the Nile , which prompted the British government to annexe Buganda and adjoining territories to create the Uganda Protectorate in 1894.
===Uganda Protectorate ( 18941962 ) ===
The Uganda Protectorate was a protectorate of the British Empire from 1894 to 1962 . In 1893 , the Imperial British East Africa Company transferred its administration rights of territory consisting mainly of the Kingdom of Buganda to the British government . The Imperial British East Africa Company relinquished its control over Uganda after Ugandan internal religious wars had driven it into bankruptcy .
In 1894 , the Uganda Protectorate was established , and the territory was extended beyond the borders of Buganda by signing more treaties with the other kingdoms ( Toro ( kingdom ) in 1900 , Ankole in 1901 , and Bunyoro in 1933 ) to an area that roughly corresponds to that of present-day Uganda .
The status of Protectorate had significantly different consequences for Uganda than had the region been made a colony like neighboring Kenya , insofar as Uganda retained a degree of self-government that would have otherwise been limited under a full colonial administration .
In the 1890s , 32,000 labourers from British India were Indian diaspora in East Africa under indentured labour contracts to construct the Uganda Railway . Most of the surviving Indians returned home , but 6,724 decided to remain in East Africa after the line 's completion . Subsequently , some became traders and took control of cotton ginning and sartorial retail .
From 1900 to 1920 , a African trypanosomiasis epidemic in the southern part of Uganda , along the north shores of Lake Victoria , killed more than 250,000 people .
===Independence ( 1962 to 1965 ) ===
Uganda gained independence from the UK on 9 October 1962 with Queen Elizabeth II as head of state and Queen of Uganda . In October 1963 , Uganda became a republic but maintained its membership in the Commonwealth of Nations .
The first post-independence election , held in 1962 , was won by an alliance between the Uganda People 's Congress ( UPC ) and Kabaka Yekka ( KY ) . UPC and KY formed the first post-independence government with Milton Obote as executive prime minister , with the Buganda Kabaka ( King ) Mutesa II of Buganda holding the largely ceremonial position of president .
===Buganda crisis ( 19621966 ) ===
Uganda 's immediate post-independence years were dominated by the relationship between the central government and the largest regional kingdom  Buganda .
From the moment the British created the Uganda protectorate , the issue of how to manage the largest monarchy within the framework of a unitary state had always been a problem . Colonial governors had failed to come up with a formula that worked . This was further complicated by Buganda 's nonchalant attitude to its relationship with the central government . Buganda never sought independence but rather appeared to be comfortable with a loose arrangement that guaranteed them privileges above the other subjects within the protectorate or a special status when the British left . This was evidenced in part by hostilities between the British colonial authorities and Buganda prior to independence .
Within Buganda , there were divisions  between those who wanted the Kabaka of Buganda to remain a dominant monarch and those who wanted to join with the rest of Uganda to create a modern secular state . The split resulted in the creation of two dominant Buganda based parties  the Kabaka Yekka ( Kabaka Only ) KY , and the Democratic Party ( Uganda ) ( DP ) that had roots in the Catholic Church . The bitterness between these two parties was extremely intense especially as the first elections for the post-Colonial parliament approached . The Kabaka particularly disliked the DP leader , Benedicto Kiwanuka .
Outside Buganda , a soft-spoken politician from Northern Uganda , Milton Obote , had forged an alliance of non-Buganda politicians to form the Uganda People 's Congress ( UPC ) . The UPC at its heart was dominated by politicians who wanted to rectify what they saw as the regional inequality that favoured Buganda 's special status . This drew in substantial support from outside Buganda . The party however remained a loose alliance of interests , but Obote showed great skill at negotiating them into a common ground based on a federal formula .
At Independence , the Buganda question remained unresolved . Uganda was one of the few colonial territories that achieved independence without a dominant political party with a clear majority in parliament . In the pre-Independence elections , the UPC ran no candidates in Buganda and won 37 of the 61 directly elected seats ( outside Buganda ) . The DP won 24 seats outside Buganda . The `` special status '' granted to Buganda meant that the 21 Buganda seats were elected by proportional representation reflecting the elections to the Buganda parliament  the Lukikko . KY won a resounding victory over DP , winning all 21 seats .
The UPC reached a high at the end of 1964 when the leader of the DP in parliament , Basil Kiiza Bataringaya , crossed the parliamentary floor with five other MPs , leaving DP with only nine seats . The DP MPs were not particularly happy that the hostility of their leader , Benedicto Kiwanuka , towards the Kabaka was hindering their chances of compromise with KY . The trickle of defections turned into a flood when 10 KY members crossed the floor when they realised the formal coalition with the UPC was no longer viable . Obote 's charismatic speeches across the country were sweeping all before him , and the UPC was winning almost every local election held and increasing its control over all district councils and legislatures outside Buganda . The response from the Kabaka was mute  probably content in his ceremonial role and symbolism in his part of the country . However , there were also major divisions within his palace that made it difficult for him to act effectively against Obote . By the time Uganda had become independent , Buganda `` was a divided house with contending social and political forces '' There were however problems brewing inside the UPC . As its ranks swelled , the ethnic , religious , regional , and personal interests began to shake the party . The party 's apparent strength was eroded in a complex sequence of factional conflicts in its central and regional structures . And by 1966 , the UPC was tearing itself apart . The conflicts were further intensified by the newcomers who had crossed the parliamentary floor from DP and KY.
The UPC delegates arrived in Gulu in 1964 for their delegates conference . Here was the first demonstration as to how Obote was losing control of his party . The battle over the Secretary-General of the party was a bitter contest between the new moderate 's candidate  Grace Ibingira and the radical John Kakonge . Ibingira subsequently became the symbol of the opposition to Obote within the UPC . This is an important factor when looking at the subsequent events that led to the crisis between Buganda and the Central government . For those outside the UPC ( including KY supporters ) , this was a sign that Obote was vulnerable . Keen observers realised the UPC was not a cohesive unit .
The collapse of the UPC-KY alliance openly revealed the dissatisfaction Obote and others had about Buganda 's `` special status '' . In 1964 , the government responded to demands from some parts of the vast Buganda Kingdom that they were not the Kabaka 's subjects . Prior to colonial rule , Buganda had been rivalled by the neighbouring Bunyoro kingdom . Buganda had conquered parts of Bunyoro and the British colonialists had formalised this in the Buganda Agreements . Known as the `` lost counties '' , the people in these areas wished to revert to being part of Bunyoro . Obote decided to allow a referendum , which angered the Kabaka and most of the rest of Buganda . The residents of the counties voted to return to Bunyoro despite the Kabaka 's attempts to influence the vote . Having lost the referendum , KY opposed the bill to pass the counties to Bunyoro , thus ending the alliance with the UPC .
The tribal nature of Ugandan politics was also manifesting itself in government . The UPC which had previously been a national party began to break along tribal lines when Ibingira challenged Obote in the UPC . The `` North/South '' ethnic divide that had been evident in economic and social spheres now entrenched itself in politics . Obote surrounded himself with mainly northern politicians  A . A. Neykon , Felix Onama , Alex Ojera  while Ibingira 's supporters who were subsequently arrested and jailed with him , were mainly from the South  George Magezi , B. Kirya , Matthias Ngobi . In time , the two factions acquired ethnic labels  `` Bantu '' ( the mainly Southern Ibingira faction ) and `` Nilotic '' ( the mainly Northern Obote faction ) . The perception that the government was at war with the Bantu was further enhanced when Obote arrested and imprisoned the mainly Bantu ministers who backed Ibingira .
These labels brought into the mix two very powerful influences . First Buganda  the people of Buganda are Bantu and therefore naturally aligned to the Ibingira faction . The Ibingira faction further advanced this alliance by accusing Obote of wanting to overthrow the Kabaka . They were now aligned to opposing Obote . Second  the security forces  the British colonialists had recruited the army and police almost exclusively from Northern Uganda due to their perceived suitability for these roles . At independence , the army and police was dominated by northern tribes  mainly Nilotic . They would now feel more affiliated to Obote , and he took full advantage of this to consolidate his power . In April 1966 , Obote passed out eight hundred new army recruits at Moroto Town , of whom seventy percent came from the Northern Region .
At the time there was a tendency to perceive central government and security forces as dominated by `` northerners ''  particularly the Acholi who through the UPC had significant access to government positions at national level . In northern Uganda there were also varied degrees of anti-Buganda feelings , particularly over the kingdom 's `` special status '' before and after independence , and all the economic and social benefits that came with this status . `` Obote brought significant numbers of northerners into the central state , both through the civil service and military , and created a patronage machine in Northern Uganda '' . However , both `` Bantu '' and `` Nilotic '' labels represent significant ambiguities . The Bantu category for example includes both Buganda and Bunyoro  historically bitter rivals . The Nilotic label includes the Lugbara , Acholi , and Langi , all of whom have bitter rivalries that were to define Uganda 's military politics later . Despite these ambiguities , these events unwittingly brought to fore the northerner/southerner political divide which to some extent still influences Ugandan politics .
The UPC fragmentation continued as opponents sensed Obote 's vulnerability . At local level where the UPC dominated most councils discontent began to challenge incumbent council leaders . Even in Obote 's home district , attempts were made to oust the head of the local district council in 1966 . A more worrying fact for the UPC was that the next national elections loomed in 1967  and without the support of KY ( who were now likely to back the DP ) , and the growing factionalism in the UPC , there was the real possibility that the UPC would be out of power in months .
Obote went after KY with a new act of parliament in early 1966 that blocked any attempt by KY to expand outside Buganda . KY appeared to respond in parliament through one of their few remaining MPs , the terminally ill Daudi Ochieng . Ochieng was an irony  although from Northern Uganda , he had risen high in the ranks of KY and become a close confidant to the Kabaka who had gifted him with large land titles in Buganda . In Obote 's absence from Parliament , Ochieng laid bare the illegal plundering of ivory and gold from the Congo that had been orchestrated by Obote 's army chief of staff , Colonel Idi Amin . He further alleged that Obote , Onama and Neykon had all benefited from the scheme . Parliament overwhelmingly voted in favour of a motion to censure Amin and investigate Obote 's involvement . This shook the government and raised tensions in the country .
KY further demonstrated its ability to challenge Obote from within his party at the UPC Buganda conference where Godfrey Binaisa ( the Attorney General ) was ousted by a faction believed to have the backing of KY , Ibingira and other anti-Obote elements in Buganda . Obote 's response was to arrest Ibingira and other ministers at a cabinet meeting and to assume special powers in February 1966 . In March 1966 , Obote also announced that the offices of President and Vice-President would cease to exist  effectively dismissing the Kabaka . Obote also gave Amin more power  giving him the Army Commander position over the previous holder ( Opolot ) who had relations to Buganda through marriage ( possibly believing Opolot would be reluctant to take military action against the Kabaka if it came to that ) . Obote abolished the constitution and effectively suspended elections due in a few months . Obote went on television and radio to accuse the Kabaka of various offences including requesting foreign troops which appears to have been explored by the Kabaka following the rumours of Amin plotting a coup . Obote further dismantled the authority of the Kabaka by announcing among other measures :
* The abolition of independent public service commissions for federal units . This removed the Kabaka 's authority to appoint civil servants in Buganda .
* The abolition of the Buganda High Court  removing any judicial authority the Kabaka had .
* The bringing of Buganda financial management under further central control .
* Abolition of lands for Buganda chiefs . Land is one the key sources of Kabaka 's power over his subjects .
The lines were now drawn for a show down between Buganda and the Central government . Historians may argue about whether this could have been avoided through compromise . This was unlikely as Obote now felt emboldened and saw the Kabaka as weak . Indeed , by accepting the presidency four years earlier and siding with the UPC , the Kabaka had divided his people and taken the side of one against the other . Within Buganda 's political institutions , rivalries driven by religion and personal ambition made the institutions ineffective and unable to respond to the central government moves . The Kabaka was often regarded as aloof and unresponsive to advice from the younger Buganda politicians who better understood the new post-Independence politics , unlike the traditionalists who were ambivalent to what was going on as long as their traditional benefits were maintained . The Kabaka favoured the neo-traditionalists .
In May 1966 , the Kabaka made his move . He asked for foreign help and the Buganda parliament demanded that the Uganda government leave Buganda ( including the capital , Kampala ) . In response Obote ordered Idi Amin to attack the Kabaka 's palace . The battle for the Kabaka 's palace was fierce  the Kabaka 's guards putting up more resistance that had been expected . The British trained Captain  the Kabaka with about 120 armed men kept Idi Amin at bay for twelve hours . It is estimated that up to 2,000 people died in the battle which ended when the army called in heavier guns and overran the palace . The anticipated countryside uprising in Buganda did not materialise and a few hours later a beaming Obote met the press to relish his victory . The Kabaka escaped over the palace walls and was transported into exile in London by supporters . He died there three years later .
===19661971 ( before the coup ) ===
In 1966 , following a power struggle between the Obote-led government and King Muteesa , Obote suspended the constitution and removed the ceremonial president and vice-president . In 1967 , a new constitution proclaimed Uganda a republic and abolished the traditional kingdoms . Obote was declared the president .
===1971 ( after the coup ) 1979 ( end of Amin regime ) ===
After a 1971 Ugandan coup d'tat , Obote was deposed from power and General Idi Amin seized control of the country . Amin ruled Uganda as dictator with the support of the military for the next eight years . He carried out mass killings within the country to maintain his rule . An estimated 80,000500,000 Ugandans lost their lives during his regime . Aside from his brutalities , he Expulsion of Asians in Uganda in 1972 the entrepreneurial Indian people minority from Uganda . In June 1976 , Palestinian terrorists hijacked an Air France flight and forced it to land at Entebbe International Airport . One hundred of the 250 passengers originally on board were held hostage until an Operation Entebbe rescued them ten days later . Amin 's reign was ended after the Uganda-Tanzania War in 1979 , in which Tanzanian forces aided by Ugandan exiles invaded Uganda .
===1979present===
Yoweri Museveni has been president since his forces toppled the previous regime in January 1986.
List of political parties in Uganda were restricted in their activities beginning that year , in a measure ostensibly designed to reduce sectarian violence . In the non-partisan democracy non-party `` Movement '' system instituted by Museveni , political parties continued to exist , but they could operate only a headquarters office . They could not open branches , hold rallies , or field candidates directly ( although electoral candidates could belong to political parties ) . A constitutional referendum cancelled this nineteen-year ban on multi-party politics in July 2005.
In the mid-to-late 1990s , Museveni was lauded by western countries as part of a new generation of African leaders .
His presidency has been marred , however , by invading and occupying the Democratic Republic of the Congo during the Second Congo War , resulting in an estimated 5.4 million deaths since 1998 , and by participating in other conflicts in the Great Lakes ( Africa ) . He has struggled for years in the civil war against the Lord 's Resistance Army , which has been guilty of numerous crimes against humanity , including child slavery , the Atiak massacre , and other mass murders . Conflict in northern Uganda has killed thousands and displaced millions .
Parliament abolished presidential term limits in 2005 , allegedly because Museveni used public funds to pay US $ 2,000 to each member of parliament who supported the measure . Presidential elections were held in February 2006 . Museveni ran against several candidates , the most prominent of them being Kizza Besigye .
On 20 February 2011 , the Uganda Electoral Commission declared the incumbent president Yoweri Kaguta Museveni the winning candidate of the 2011 elections that were held on 18 February 2011 . The opposition however , were not satisfied with the results , condemning them as full of sham and rigging . According to the official results , Museveni won with 68 percent of the votes . This easily topped his nearest challenger , Besigye , who had been Museveni 's physician and told reporters that he and his supporters `` downrightly snub '' the outcome as well as the unremitting rule of Museveni or any person he may appoint . Besigye added that the rigged elections would definitely lead to an illegitimate leadership and that it is up to Ugandans to critically analyse this . The European Union 's Election Observation Mission reported on improvements and flaws of the Ugandan electoral process : `` The electoral campaign and polling day were conducted in a peaceful manner [ ... ] However , the electoral process was marred by avoidable administrative and logistical failures that led to an unacceptable number of Ugandan citizens being disfranchised . ''
Since August 2012 , hacktivist group Anonymous ( group ) has threatened Ugandan officials and hacked official government websites over its anti-gay bills . Some international donors have threatened to cut financial aid to the country if anti-gay bills continue .
Indicators of a plan for succession by the president 's son , Muhoozi Kainerugaba , have increased tensions .
==Geography==
Uganda is located in southeast Africa between 1 N and 4 N latitude , and 30 E and 35 E longitude , its geography is very diverse consisting of volcanic hills , mountains , and lakes . The country sits at an average of 900 meters above sea level . Both the eastern and western borders of Uganda have mountains . The Ruwenzori mountain range contains the highest peak in Uganda , which is named Alexandra and measures 5,094 meters .
===Lakes and rivers===
Much of the south of the country is heavily influenced by one of the world 's biggest lakes , Lake Victoria , which contains many islands . Most important cities are located in the south , near this lake , including the capital Kampala and the nearby city of Entebbe .
Lake Kyoga is in the centre of the country and is surrounded by extensive marshy areas .
Although landlocked , Uganda contains many large lakes . Besides Lakes Victoria and Kyoga , there are Lake Albert ( Africa ) , Lake Edward , and the smaller Lake George ( Uganda ) .
Uganda lies almost completely within the Nile basin . The Victoria Nile drains from Lake Victoria into Lake Kyoga and thence into Lake Albert on the Congolese border . It then runs northwards into South Sudan . An area in eastern Uganda is drained by the Turkwel River , part of the internal drainage basin of Lake Turkana . The extreme north-eastern part of Uganda drains into the Lotikipi Basin , which is primarily in Kenya .
==Environment and conservation==
Uganda has List of Protected Areas in Uganda , including ten national parks : Bwindi Impenetrable National Park and Rwenzori Mountains National Park ( both UNESCO World Heritage Sites ) , Kibale National Park , Kidepo Valley National Park , Lake Mburo National Park , Mgahinga Gorilla National Park , Mount Elgon National Park , Murchison Falls National Park , Queen Elizabeth National Park , and Semuliki National Park .
The country had a 2019 Forest Landscape Integrity Index mean score of 4.36/10 , ranking it 128th globally out of 172 countries .
==Government and politics==
The President of Uganda is both [ of state ] and [ of government ] . The president appoints a vice-president and a Prime Minister of Uganda to aid him in governing .
The parliament is formed by the National Assembly of Uganda , which has 449 members . These include ; 290 constituency representatives , 116 district woman representatives , 10 representatives of the Uganda Peoples Defence Forces , 5 representatives of the youth , 5 representatives of workers , 5 representatives of persons with disabilities and 18 ex-official members .
===Corruption===
Transparency International has rated Uganda 's public sector as one of the most corrupt in the world . In 2016 , Uganda ranked 151st worst out of 176 and had a score of 25 on a scale from 0 ( perceived as most corrupt ) to 100 ( perceived as clean ) .
The World Bank 's 2015 Worldwide Governance Indicators ranked Uganda in the worst 12 percentile of all countries . According to the United States Department of State 's 2012 Human Rights Report on Uganda , `` The World Bank 's most recent Worldwide Governance Indicators reflected corruption was a severe problem '' and that `` the country annually loses 768.9 billion shillings ( $ 286 million ) to corruption . ''
Ugandan parliamentarians in 2014 earned 60 times what was earned by most state employees , and they sought a major increase . This caused widespread criticism and protests , including the smuggling of two piglets into the parliament in June 2014 to highlight corruption amongst members of parliament . The protesters , who were arrested , used the word `` MPigs '' to highlight their grievance .
A specific scandal , which had significant international consequences and highlighted the presence of corruption in high-level government offices , was the embezzlement of $ 12.6 million of donor funds from the Office of the Prime Minister in 2012 . These funds were `` earmarked as crucial support for rebuilding northern Uganda , ravaged by a 20-year war , and Karamoja , Uganda 's poorest region . '' This scandal prompted the EU , the UK , Germany , Denmark , Ireland , and Norway to suspend aid .
Widespread grand and petty corruption involving public officials and political patronage systems have also seriously affected the investment climate in Uganda . One of the high corruption risk areas is the public procurement in which non-transparent under-the-table cash payments are often demanded from procurement officers .
What may ultimately compound this problem is the availability of oil . The Petroleum Bill , passed by parliament in 2012 and touted by the NRM as bringing transparency to the oil sector , has failed to please domestic and international political commentators and economists . For instance , Angelo Izama , a Ugandan energy analyst at the US-based Open Society Foundation said the new law was tantamount to `` handing over an ATM ( cash ) machine '' to Museveni and his regime . According to Global Witness in 2012 , a non-governmental organisation devoted to international law , Uganda now has `` oil reserves that have the potential to double the government 's revenue within six to ten years , worth an estimated US $ 2.4 billion per year . ''
The Non-Governmental Organizations ( Amendment ) Act , passed in 2006 , has stifled the productivity of NGOs through erecting barriers to entry , activity , funding and assembly within the sector . Burdensome and corrupt registration procedures ( i.e . requiring recommendations from government officials ; annual re-registration ) , unreasonable regulation of operations ( i.e . requiring government notification prior to making contact with individuals in NGO 's area of interest ) , and the precondition that all foreign funds be passed through the Bank of Uganda , among other things , are severely limiting the output of the NGO sector . Furthermore , the sector 's freedom of speech has been continually infringed upon through the use of intimidation , and the recent Public Order Management Bill ( severely limiting freedom of assembly ) will only add to the government 's stockpile of ammunition .
===Administrative divisions===
As of 2018 , Uganda is divided into 121 Districts of Uganda . Rural areas of districts are subdivided into Sub-counties of Uganda sub-counties , parishes , and villages . Municipal and town councils are designated in urban areas of districts .
Political subdivisions in Uganda are officially served and united by the Uganda Local Governments Association ( ULGA ) , a voluntary and non-profit body which also serves as a forum for support and guidance for Ugandan sub-national governments .
Parallel with the state administration , five traditional Bantu peoples kingdoms have remained , enjoying some degrees of mainly cultural autonomy . The kingdoms are Toro Kingdom , Busoga , Bunyoro , Buganda , and Rwenzururu . Furthermore , some groups attempt to restore Ankole as one of the officially recognised traditional kingdoms , to no avail yet . Several other kingdoms and chiefdoms are officially recognised by the government , including the union of Alur chiefdoms , the Iteso paramount chieftaincy , the paramount chieftaincy of Lango and the Padhola state .
===Foreign relations ===
Uganda is a member of the East African Community ( EAC ) , along with Kenya , Tanzania , Rwanda , Burundi and South Sudan . According to the East African Common Market Protocol of 2010 , the free trade and free movement of people is guaranteed , including the right to reside in another member country for purposes of employment . This protocol , however , has not been implemented because of work permit and other bureaucratic , legal , and financial obstacles . Uganda is a founding member of the Intergovernmental Authority on Development ( IGAD ) an eight-country bloc including governments from the Horn of Africa , Nile Valley and the African Great Lakes . Its headquarters are in Djibouti City . Uganda is also a member of the Organization of Islamic Cooperation .
=== Military ===
In Uganda , the Uganda People 's Defence Force serves as the military . The List of countries by number of military and paramilitary personnel is estimated at 45,000 soldiers on active duty . The Uganda army is involved in several peacekeeping and combat missions in the region , with commentators noting that only the United States Armed Forces is deployed in more countries . Uganda has soldiers deployed in the northern and eastern areas of the Democratic Republic of the Congo and in the Central African Republic , Somalia , and South Sudan .
==Human rights==
There are many areas which continue to attract concern when it comes to human rights in Uganda .
Conflict in the northern parts of the country continues to generate reports of abuses by both the rebel Lord 's Resistance Army ( LRA ) , led by Joseph Kony , and the Uganda People 's Defence Force . A UN official accused the LRA in February 2009 of `` appalling brutality '' in the Democratic Republic of Congo .
The number of internally displaced persons is estimated at 1.4 ; million . Torture continues to be a widespread practice amongst security organisations . Attacks on political freedom in the country , including the arrest and beating of opposition members of parliament , have led to international criticism , culminating in May 2005 in a decision by the British government to withhold part of its aid to the country . The arrest of the main opposition leader Kizza Besigye and the siege of the High Court ( Uganda ) during a hearing of Besigye 's case by heavily armed security forces  before the Ugandan general election , 2006  led to condemnation .
Child labour is common in Uganda . Many child workers are active in agriculture . Children who work on tobacco farms
in Uganda are exposed to health hazards . Child domestic servants in Uganda risk sexual abuse . Trafficking of children occurs . Slavery
and forced labour are prohibited by the Ugandan constitution .
The US Committee for Refugees and Immigrants reported several violations of refugee rights in 2007 , including forcible deportations by the Ugandan government and violence directed against refugees .
Torture and extrajudicial killings have been a pervasive problem in Uganda in recent years . For instance , according to a 2012 US State Department report , `` the African Center for Treatment and Rehabilitation for Torture Victims registered 170 allegations of torture against police , 214 against the UPDF , 1 against military police , 23 against the Special Investigations Unit , 361 against unspecified security personnel , and 24 against prison officials '' between January and September 2012.
In September 2009 Museveni refused Kabaka Muwenda Mutebi , the Baganda king , permission to visit some areas of Buganda Kingdom , particularly the Kayunga district . Riots occurred and over 40 people were killed while others remain imprisoned to this date . Furthermore , 9 more people were killed during the April 2011 `` Walk to Work '' demonstrations . According to the Humans Rights Watch 2013 World Report on Uganda , the government has failed to investigate the killings associated with both of these events .
===LGBT rights===
In 2007 , a Ugandan newspaper , the Red Pepper ( newspaper ) , published a list of allegedly gay men , many of whom suffered harassment as a result .
On 9 October 2010 , the Ugandan newspaper Rolling Stone ( Uganda ) published a front-page article titled `` 100 Pictures of Uganda 's Top Homos Leak '' that listed the names , addresses , and photographs of 100 homosexuals alongside a yellow banner that read `` Hang Them '' . The paper also alleged that homosexuals aimed to Homosexual recruitment Ugandan children . This publication attracted international attention and criticism from human rights organisations , such as Amnesty International , No Peace Without Justice and the International Lesbian , Gay , Bisexual , Trans and Intersex Association . According to gay rights activists , many Ugandans have been attacked since the publication . On 27 January 2011 , gay rights activist David Kato was murdered .
In 2009 , the Ugandan parliament considered an Uganda Anti-Homosexuality Bill Anti-Homosexuality Bill that would have broadened the criminalisation of homosexuality by introducing the death penalty for people who have previous convictions , or are HIV-positive , and engage in same-sex sexual acts . The bill also included provisions for Ugandans who engage in same-sex sexual relations outside of Uganda , asserting that they may be extradition back to Uganda for punishment , and included penalties for individuals , companies , media organisations , or non-governmental organizations that support legal protection for homosexuality or sodomy . The private member 's bill was submitted by Member of Parliament David Bahati in Uganda on 14 October 2009 , and was believed to have had widespread support in the Uganda parliament . The hacktivist group Anonymous hacked into Ugandan government websites in protest of the bill . The debate of the bill was delayed in response to global condemnation but was eventually passed on 20 December 2013 and signed by President Yoweri Museveni on 24 February 2014 . The death penalty was dropped in the final legislation . The law was widely condemned by the international community . Denmark , the Netherlands , and Sweden said they would withhold aid . The World Bank on 28 February 2014 said it would postpone a US $ 90 million loan , while the United States said it was reviewing ties with Uganda . On 1 August 2014 , the Constitutional Court of Uganda ruled the bill invalid as it was not passed with the required quorum . A 13 August 2014 news report said that the Ugandan attorney general had dropped all plans to appeal , per a directive from President Museveni who was concerned about foreign reaction to the bill and who also said that any newly introduced bill should not criminalise same-sex relationships between consenting adults . Progress on the continent of Africa has been slow but progressing with South Africa being the only country where same sex marriages are recognised .
==Economy and infrastructure==
The Bank of Uganda is the central bank of Uganda and handles monetary policy along with the printing of the Ugandan shilling .
In 2015 , Uganda 's economy generated export income from the following merchandise : coffee ( US $ 402.63 million ) , oil re-exports ( US $ 131.25 million ) , base metals and products ( US $ 120.00 million ) , fish ( US $ 117.56 million ) , maize ( US $ 90.97 million ) , cement ( US $ 80.13 million ) , tobacco ( US $ 73.13 million ) , tea ( US $ 69.94 million ) , sugar ( US $ 66.43 million ) , hides and skins ( US $ 62.71 million ) , cocoa beans ( US $ 55.67 million ) , beans ( US $ 53.88 million ) , sesame ( US $ 52.20 million ) , flowers ( US $ 51.44 million ) , and other products ( US $ 766.77 million ) .
The country has been experiencing consistent economic growth . In fiscal year 201516 , Uganda recorded gross domestic product growth of 4.6 percent in real terms and 11.6 percent in nominal terms . This compares to 5.0 percent real growth in fiscal year 201415 .
The country has largely untapped reserves of both crude oil and natural gas . While agriculture accounted for 56 percent of the economy in 1986 , with coffee as its main export , it has now been surpassed by the services sector , which accounted for 52 percent of GDP in 2007 . In the 1950s , the British colonial regime encouraged some 500,000 subsistence farmers to join co-operatives . Since 1986 , the government ( with the support of foreign countries and international agencies ) has acted to rehabilitate an economy devastated during the regime of Idi Amin and the subsequent civil war .
In 2012 , the World Bank still listed Uganda on the Heavily Indebted Poor Countries list .
Economic growth has not always led to poverty reduction . Despite an average annual growth of 2.5 percent between 2000 and 2003 , poverty levels increased by 3.8 percent during that time . This has highlighted the importance of avoiding jobless growth and is part of the rising awareness in development circles of the need for Development economics # equitable growth not just in Uganda , but across the developing world .
With the Uganda securities exchanges established in 1996 , several equities have been listed . The government has used the stock market as an avenue for privatisation . All government treasury issues are listed on the securities exchange . The Capital Markets Authority has licensed 18 brokers , asset managers , and investment advisors including : African Alliance Investment Bank , Baroda Capital Markets Uganda Limited , Crane Financial Services Uganda Limited , Crested Stocks and Securities Limited , Dyer & Blair Investment Bank , Equity Stock Brokers Uganda Limited , Renaissance Capital Investment Bank and UAP Financial Services Limited . As one of the ways of increasing formal domestic savings , pension sector reform is the centre of attention ( 2007 ) .
Uganda traditionally depends on Kenya for access to the Indian Ocean port of Mombasa . Efforts have intensified to establish a second access route to the sea via the lakeside ports of Bukasa in Uganda and Musoma in Tanzania , connected by railway to Arusha in the Tanzanian interior and to the port of Tanga , Tanzania on the Indian Ocean .
Uganda is a member of the East African Community and a potential member of the planned East African Federation .
Uganda has a large diaspora , residing mainly in the United States and the United Kingdom . This diaspora has contributed enormously to Uganda 's economic growth through remittances and other investments ( especially property ) . According to the World Bank , Uganda received in 2016 an estimated US $ 1.099 billion in remittances from abroad , second only to Kenya ( US $ 1.574 billion ) in the East African Community . and seventh in Africa Uganda also serves as an economic hub for a number of neighbouring countries like the Democratic Republic of the Congo , South Sudan , and Rwanda .
The Ugandan Bureau of Statistics announced inflation was 4.6 percent in November 2016 . On 29 June 2018 , Uganda 's statistics agency said the country registered a drop in inflation to 3.4 percent in the financial year ending 2017/18 compared to the 5.7 percent recorded in the financial year 2016/17 .
===Industry===
Uganda ranked as List of countries by GDP ( nominal ) among the countries of the world in nominal Gross Domestic Product by the International Monetary Fund with a GDP of 26,349 ( US $ million ) . The World Bank ranked Uganda as List of countries by GDP ( nominal ) in nominal GDP with a GDP of 25,891 ( US $ million ) .
Based on the GDP with purchasing power parity the IMF ranked Uganda as List of countries by GDP ( PPP ) ( 91,212 million of current Int $ ) and the World Bank List of countries by GDP ( PPP ) ( 79,889 million of current Int $ ) .
Since the 1990s , the economy in Uganda is growing . Real gross domestic product ( GDP ) grew at an average of 6.7 % annually during the period 19902015 , whereas real GDP per capita grew at 3.3 % per annum during the same period .
===Poverty===
Uganda is one of the poorest nations in the world . In 2012 , 37.8 percent of the population lived on less than $ 1.25 a day . Despite making enormous progress in reducing the countrywide poverty incidence from 56 percent of the population in 1992 to 24.5 percent in 2009 , poverty remains deep-rooted in the country 's rural areas , which are home to 84 percent of Ugandans .
People in rural areas of Uganda depend on farming as the main source of income and 90 per cent of all rural women work in the agricultural sector . In addition to agricultural work , rural women are responsible for the caretaking of their families . The average Ugandan woman spends 9 hours a day on domestic tasks , such as preparing food and clothing , fetching water and firewood , and caring for the elderly , the sick as well as orphans . As such , women on average work longer hours than men , between 12 and 18 hours per day , with a mean of 15 hours , as compared to men , who work between 8 and 10 hours a day .
To supplement their income , rural women may engage in small-scale entrepreneurial activities such as rearing and selling local breeds of animals . Nonetheless , because of their heavy workload , they have little time for these income-generating activities . The poor can not support their children at school and in most cases , girls drop out of school to help out in domestic work or to get married . Other girls engage in sex work . As a result , young women tend to have older and more sexually experienced partners and this puts women at a disproportionate risk of getting affected by HIV , accounting for about 5.7 per cent of all adults living with HIV in Uganda .
Maternal health in rural Uganda lags behind national policy targets and the Millennium Development Goals , with geographical inaccessibility , lack of transport and financial burdens identified as key demand-side constraints to accessing maternal health services ; as such , interventions like intermediate transport mechanisms have been adopted as a means to improve women 's access to maternal health care services in rural regions of the country .
Gender inequality is the main hindrance to reducing women 's poverty . Women are subjected to an overall lower social status than men . For many women , this reduces their power to act independently , participate in community life , become educated and escape reliance upon abusive men .
=== Air transportation ===
There are List of airports in Uganda in Uganda . Commercial airlines operate scheduled passenger services out of four airports . Uganda has an international airport , Entebbe International Airport , which is located south-west of Kampala . In 2017 the airport traffic hit 1.53 million passengers , 8 % more than the previous year . A second international airport , Hoima International Airport , is currently under construction .
=== Road network ===
Road transportation is the most important way of transportation in Uganda . 95 % of freight and passenger traffic is handled by road traffic . The road network in Uganda is approximately long . About 4 % of these roads are paved which means about . The different types of roads are national roads ( 17 % ) , district roads ( 26 % ) , urban roads ( 7 % ) , and community roads ( 50 % ) . The national roads make up about 17 % of the road network but carry over 80 % of the total road traffic . In Uganda there are 83,000 private cars which means 2.94 cars per 1000 inhabitants .
=== Railroad ===
The rail network in Uganda is approximately long . The longest lines are the main line from Kampala to Tororo ( ) , the western line from Kampala to Kasese ( ) , the northern line from Tororo to Pakwach ( ) .
===Communications===
There are seven telecommunications companies serving over 21 million subscribers in a population of over 34 million . More than 95 percent of internet connections are made using mobile phones .

===Energy===
Uganda is richly endowed with abundant energy resources , which are fairly distributed throughout the country . These include hydropower , biomass , solar , geothermal , peat and fossil fuels .
In the 1980s , the majority of energy in Uganda came from charcoal and wood . However , oil was found in the Lake Albert ( Africa ) area , totaling an estimated barrels of crude . Heritage Oil discovered one of the largest crude oil finds in Uganda , and continues operations there .
Uganda and Tanzania signed a deal on 13 September 2016 that will see the two countries build a 1,445 ; km , $ 3.5bn crude oil pipeline . The UgandaTanzania Crude Oil Pipeline UgandaTanzania Crude Oil Pipeline ( UTCOP ) , also known as the UgandaTanzania Crude Oil Pipeline East African Crude Oil Pipeline ( EACOP ) will be the first of its kind in East Africa , will connect Uganda  s oil-rich Hoima region with the Indian ocean through the Tanga port in Tanzania .
=== Water supply and sanitation ===
According to a 2006 published report , the Ugandan water supply and sanitation sector had made substantial progress in urban areas since the mid-1990s , with substantial increases in coverage as well as in operational and commercial performance . Sector reforms in the period 19982003 included the commercialisation and modernisation of the National Water and Sewerage Corporation operating in cities and larger towns , as well as decentralisation and private sector participation in small towns .
Although these reforms have attracted significant international attention , 38 percent of the population still had no access to an improved water source in 2010 . Concerning access to improved sanitation , figures have varied widely . According to government figures , it was 70 percent in rural areas and 81 percent in urban areas in 2011 , while according to UN figures it was only 34 percent .
The water and sanitation sector was recognised as a key area under the 2004 Poverty Eradication Action Plan ( PEAP ) , Uganda 's
main strategy paper to fight poverty . According to a 2006 published report , a comprehensive expenditure framework had been introduced to co-ordinate financial support by external donors , the national government , and NGO . The PEAP estimated that from 2001 to 2015 , about US $ 1.4 billion , or US $ 92 million per year , was needed to increase water supply coverage up to 95 percent , with rural areas needing US $ 956 million , urban areas and large towns needing US $ 281 million , and small towns needing US $ 136 million .
===Education===
Uganda  s educational system , while lacking in many areas , has seen significant change in recent years . The educational system is set up so that children spend seven years in primary school , six years in secondary school , and three to five years in post secondary school . In 1997 , the government declared that primary school would be free for all children . This amendment has had huge benefits . In 1986 , only two million children were attending primary school . By 1999 , six million children were attending primary school , and this number has continued to climb .
Following significant gains in access to primary education since 1997 when universal primary education ( UPE ) was introduced , Uganda in 2007 became the first country in sub-Saharan Africa to introduce universal secondary education ( USE ) . This bold step by the Government of Uganda led to an increase in lower secondary enrolment of nearly 25 % between 2007 and 2012.
At the 2002 census , Uganda had a literacy rate of 66.8 percent ( 76.8 percent male and 57.7 percent female ) . Public spending on education was at 5.2 percent of the 20022005 GDP .
, the Uganda National Council for Higher Education website listed 46 private accredited universities . to mention a few , Makerere University , Mbarara University , Kyambogo University , Gulu University , Uganda Christian University , Kampala International University among many more .
===Health===
====Health system====
There were eight physicians per 100,000 persons in the early 2000s . Uganda 's elimination of user fees at state health facilities in 2001 has resulted in an 80 percent increase in visits , with over half of this increase coming from the poorest 20 percent of the population . This policy has been cited as a key factor in helping Uganda achieve its Millennium Development Goals and as an example of the importance of equity in achieving those goals . Despite this policy , many users are denied care if they do not provide their own medical equipment , as happened in the highly publicised case of Jennifer Anguko . Poor communication within hospitals , low satisfaction with health services and distance to health service providers undermine the provision of quality health care to people living in Uganda , and particularly for those in poor and elderly-headed households . The provision of subsidies for poor and rural populations , along with the extension of public private partnerships , have been identified as important provisions to enable vulnerable populations to access health services .
====Life expectancy====
Life expectancy at birth was estimated to be 53.45 years in 2012 . The infant mortality rate was approximately 61 deaths per 1,000 children in 2012.
====Infectious disease====
In July 2012 , there was an Ebola outbreak in the Kibaale District of the country . On 4 October 2012 , the Ministry of Health officially declared the end of the outbreak after at least 16 people had died .
The Health Ministry announced on 16 August 2013 that three people had died in northern Uganda from a suspected outbreak of Congo Crimean Hemorrhagic Fever .
Uganda has been among the rare HIV success stories . Infection rates of 30 per cent of the population in the 1980s fell to 6.4 percent by the end of 2008 . Meanwhile , the practice of abstinence was found to have decreased .
====Reproductive health====
Less than half of all sexually active unmarried women use a modern contraceptive method , a fraction that has barely changed from 2000 to 2011 . However , only ~26 % of married women used contraceptives in 2011 . The use of contraceptives also differs substantially between poor ( ~15 % ) and wealthy women ( ~40 % ) . As a result , Ugandan women have ~6 children while they prefer to have around ~4 . According to the 2011 Uganda Demographic and Health Survey ( DHS ) , more than 40 % of births are unplanned . In 2010 , the Ugandan Ministry of Health estimated that unsafe abortion accounted for 8 % of the country 's maternal deaths . The 2006 Uganda Demographic Health Survey ( UDHS ) indicated that roughly 6,000 women die each year from pregnancy-related complications . Pilot studies in 2012 by Future Health Systems have shown that this rate could be significantly reduced by implementing a voucher scheme for health services and transport to clinics .
The prevalence of female genital mutilation ( FGM ) is low : according to a 2013 UNICEF report , only 1 percent of women in Uganda have undergone FGM , with the practice being illegal in the country .
===Crime and law enforcement===
In Uganda , the Allied Democratic Forces is considered a violent rebel force that opposes the Ugandan government . These rebels are an enemy of the Uganda People 's Defence Force and are considered an affiliate of Al-Shabaab ( militant group ) Al-Shabaab .
===Tourism===
Tourism in Uganda is focused on Uganda 's landscape and wildlife . It is a major driver of employment , investment and foreign exchange , contributing 4.9 trillion Ugandan shillings ( US $ 1.88 billion or 1.4 billion as of August 2013 ) to Uganda 's Gross domestic product in the financial year 201213 . The Uganda Tourism Board is responsible for maintaining information pertaining to tourism in Uganda . The main attractions are photo safaris through the List of protected areas of Uganda . Other attractions include the Mountain Gorillas found in Bwindi Impenetrable National Park ( BINP ) and Mgahinga Gorilla National Park ( MGNP ) , Uganda having some of the oldest cultural kingdom in Africa has many National Cultural Sites of Uganda . Uganda is a birding paradise boasting a massive bird list of more of than 1073 recorded bird species ranking 4th in Africa 's bird species and 16th internationally . Uganda has landscapes ranging from white-capped Rwenzori Mountains and the Great Rift Valley .
== Science and technology ==
The National Science , Technology and Innovation Policy dates from 2009 . Its overarching goal is to  strengthen national capability to generate , transfer and apply scientific knowledge , skills and technologies that ensure sustainable utilization of natural resources for the realisation of Uganda 's development objectives.  The policy precedes Uganda Vision 2040 , which was launched in April 2013 to transform  Ugandan society from a peasant to a modern and prosperous country within 30 years ,  in the words of the Cabinet . Uganda Vision 2040 vows to strengthen the private sector , improve education and training , modernize infrastructure and the underdeveloped services and agriculture sectors , foster industrialization and promote good governance , among other goals . Potential areas for economic development include oil and gas , tourism , minerals and information and communication technologies ( ICTs ) .
Research funding climbed between 2008 and 2010 from 0.33 % to 0.48 % of GDP . Over the same period , the number of researchers doubled ( in head counts ) from 1 387 to 2 823 , according to the UNESCO Institute for Statistics . This represents a leap from 44 to 83 researchers per million inhabitants over the same period . One in four researchers is a woman .
Uganda has been able to manufacture prototype of cars called kiira in which the government invested 70usd .

Uganda 's population grew from 9.5 million people in 1969 to 34.9 million in 2014 . With respect to the last inter-censal period ( September 2002 ) , the population increased by 10.6 million people in the past 12 years . Uganda 's median age of 15 years is the lowest in the world . Uganda has the fifth highest total fertility rate in the world , at 5.97 children born per woman ( 2014 estimates ) .
There were about 80,000 Indians in Uganda before Idi Amin required the Expulsion of Asians from Uganda expulsion of Ugandan-Asians ( mostly of Indian origin ) in 1972 , which reduced the population to as low as 7,000 . Many Indians , however , returned to Uganda after Amin 's fall ouster in 1979 . Around 90 percent of Ugandan Indians reside in Kampala .
According to the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees , Uganda hosts over 1.1 million refugees on its soil as of November 2018 . Most come from neighbouring countries in the African Great Lakes region , particularly South Sudan ( 68.0 percent ) and the Democratic Republic of the Congo ( 24.6 % ) .
===Languages===
Swahili language , a widely used language throughout the African Great Lakes region , was approved as the country 's second official national language in 2005 . English language was the only official language until the constitution was amended in 2005 . Although Swahili has not been favoured by the Bantu-speaking populations of the south and south-west of the country , it is an important lingua franca in the northern regions . It is also widely used in the police and military forces , which may be a historical result of the disproportionate recruitment of northerners into the security forces during the colonial period . The status of Swahili has thus alternated with the political group in power . For example , Idi Amin , who came from the north-west , declared Swahili to be the national language .
===Religion===
The Roman Catholicism in Uganda had the largest number of adherents ( 39.3 percent , down from 41.6 in 2002 ) , followed by the Anglicanism Church of Uganda ( 32 percent , down from 35.9 percent ) . The category of Evangelical/Pentecostal/Born-Again showed the most growth , rising from 4.7 % in 2002 to 11.1 % in 2018 . Adventism and other Protestant churches claimed most of the remaining Christians , although there was also a small Eastern Orthodox community . The next most reported religion of Uganda was Islam in Uganda , with Muslims representing 13.7 percent of the population , up from 12.1 % in 2002.
The remainder of the population according to the 2014 census followed traditional religions ( 0.1 percent , down from 1 % in 2002 ) , other religions ( 1.4 percent ) , or had no religious affiliation ( 0.2 percent ) .
===Largest cities and towns===
==Culture==
Owing to the large number of communities , culture within Uganda is diverse . Many Asians ( mostly from India ) who were expelled during the regime of Idi Amin have returned to Uganda .
===Sport===

Little League teams from Uganda qualified for and attended the 2012 Little League World Series .
====Olympics====
===Cinema===
The Ugandan film industry is relatively young . It is developing quickly , but still faces an assortment of challenges . There has been support for the industry as seen in the proliferation of film festivals such as Amakula , Pearl International Film Festival , Maisha African Film Festival and Manya Human Rights Festival . However , filmmakers struggle against the competing markets from other countries on the continent such as those in Nigeria and South Africa in addition to the big budget films from Hollywood .
The first publicly recognised film that was produced solely by Ugandans was Feelings Struggle , which was directed and written by Hajji Ashraf Ssemwogerere in 2005 . This marks the year of ascent of film in Uganda , a time where many enthusiasts were proud to classify themselves as cinematographers in varied capacities .
The local film industry is polarised between two types of filmmakers . The first are filmmakers who use the Nollywood video film era 's guerrilla approach to film making , churning out a picture in around two weeks and screening it in makeshift video halls . The second is the filmmaker who has the film aesthetic , but with limited funds has to depend on the competitive scramble for donor cash .
Though cinema in Uganda is evolving , it still faces major challenges . Along with technical problems such as refining acting and editing skills , there are issues regarding funding and lack of government support and investment . There are no schools in the country dedicated to film , banks do not extend credit to film ventures , and distribution and marketing of movies remains poor .
The Uganda Communications Commission ( UCC ) is preparing regulations starting in 2014 that require Ugandan television to broadcast 70 percent Ugandan content and of this , 40 percent to be independent productions . With the emphasis on Ugandan Film and the UCC regulations favouring Ugandan productions for mainstream television , Ugandan film may become more prominent and successful in the near future .

Lithuania ( ; Lietuva ) , officially the Republic of Lithuania ( Lietuvos Respublika links=no ) , is a country in the Baltic region of Europe . Lithuania is one of the Baltic states . Situated on the eastern shore of the Baltic Sea , to the southeast of Sweden and to the east of Denmark , Lithuania is bordered by Latvia to the north , Belarus to the east and south , Poland to the south , and Kaliningrad Oblast ( a Russian Enclave and exclave ) to the southwest . Lithuania has an estimated population of 2.8 million people . The capital and largest city is Vilnius and other major cities are Kaunas and Klaipda . Lithuanians belong to the ethnic and linguistic group of Balts . The official language , Lithuanian language , is one of only two living languages in the Baltic languages of the Indo-European languages Indo-European language family , the other being Latvian language .
For centuries , the southeastern shores of the Baltic Sea were inhabited by various Balts . In the 1230s , the Lithuanian lands were united by Mindaugas and the Kingdom of Lithuania was created on 6 July 1253 . During the 14th century , the Grand Duchy of Lithuania was the largest country in Europe ; present-day Lithuania , Belarus , Ukraine , and parts of Poland and Russia were the territories of the Grand Duchy . With the Lublin Union of 1569 , Lithuania and Poland formed a voluntary two-state personal union , the PolishLithuanian Commonwealth . The Commonwealth lasted more than two centuries , until neighbouring countries Partitions of Poland it from 1772 to 1795 , with the Russian Empire annexing most of Lithuania 's territory .
As World War I neared its end , Lithuania 's Act of Independence of Lithuania was signed on 16 February 1918 , declaring the founding of the modern Republic of Lithuania . During the Second World War , Lithuania was first Soviet occupation of the Baltic states ( 1940 ) and then by Occupation of Lithuania by Nazi Germany . As World War II neared its end and the Germans retreated , the Soviet occupation of the Baltic states ( 1944 ) . On 11 March 1990 , a year before the formal dissolution of the Soviet Union , Lithuania became the first Baltic state to proclaim its independence , resulting in the restoration of the independent Act of the Re-Establishment of the State of Lithuania .
Lithuania is considered a developed country and ranks 34th ( out of 189 ) on the Human Development Index . It ranks favourably in metrics of Freedom in the World ( report ) , Press Freedom Index and Internet censorship and surveillance by country . However , Lithuania has been experiencing a gradual population decline since the 1990s , while Suicide in Lithuania is considered a huge social problem , with its suicide rate being the highest in all of the European Union ( EU ) as well as the OECD , which the country are both a member of . Lithuania is also a member of the Council of Europe , eurozone , the Nordic Investment Bank , Schengen Agreement and NATO . It also participates in the NB8 Nordic-Baltic cooperation of Northern Europe and Eastern European countries .
==Etymology==
The first known record of the name of Lithuania ( Lietuva ) is in a 9 March 1009 story of Bruno of Querfurt in the Quedlinburg Chronicle . The Chronicle recorded a Latinized form of the name Lietuva : Litua ( pronounced ) . Due to the lack of reliable evidence , the true meaning of the name is unknown . Nowadays , scholars still debate the meaning of the word and there are a few plausible versions .
Since Lietuva has a suffix ( -uva ) , the original word should have no suffix . A likely candidate is Liet . Because many Baltic language ethnonyms originated from [ linguists have searched for its origin among local hydronyms . Usually , such names evolved through the following process : hydronym  toponym  ethnonym ] . [ [ Lietava River , a small river not far from Kernav , the core area of the Duchy of Lithuania and a possible first capital of the eventual Grand Duchy of Lithuania , is usually credited as the source of the name . However , the river is very small and some find it improbable that such a small and local object could have lent its name to an entire nation . On the other hand , such naming is not unprecedented in world history .
Artras Dubonis proposed another hypothesis , that Lietuva relates to the word leiiai ( plural of leitis ) . From the middle of the 13th century , leiiai were a distinct warrior social group of the Lithuanians society subordinate to the List of rulers of Lithuania or the state itself . The word leiiai is used in the 1416th century historical sources as an ethnonym for Lithuanians ( but not Samogitians ) and is still used , usually poetically or in historical contexts , in the Latvian language , which is closely related to Lithuanian .
==History==
The first people settled in the territory of Lithuania after the last glacial period in the 10th millennium BC : Kunda culture , Neman culture and Narva cultures . They were traveling hunters and did not form stable settlements . In the 8th millennium BC , the climate became much warmer , and forests developed . The inhabitants of what is now Lithuania then travelled less and engaged in local hunting , gathering and fresh-water fishing . Agriculture did not emerge until the 3rd millennium BC due to a harsh climate and terrain and a lack of suitable tools to cultivate the land . Crafts and trade also started to form at this time . Over a millennium , the Indo-European migrations Indo-Europeans , who arrived in the 3rd  2nd millennium BC , mixed with the local population and formed various Baltic tribes .
The Baltic tribes did not maintain close cultural or political contacts with the Roman Empire , but they did maintain trade contacts ( see Amber Road ) . Tacitus , in his study Germania ( book ) , described the Aesti people , inhabitants of the south-eastern Baltic Sea shores who were probably Balts , around the year 97 AD . The Western Balts differentiated and became known to outside chroniclers first . Ptolemy in the 2nd century AD knew of the Galindians and Yotvingians , and Early Middle Ages chroniclers mentioned Old Prussians , Curonians and Semigallians .
The Lithuanian language is considered to be very Conservative ( language ) for its close connection to Indo-European roots . It is believed to have differentiated from the Latvian language , the most closely related existing language , around the 7th century . Traditional Lithuanian mythology , with many archaic elements , were long preserved . Rulers ' bodies were cremated up until the conversion to Christianity : the descriptions of the cremation ceremonies of the grand dukes Algirdas and Kstutis have survived .
===Grand Duchy of Lithuania===
From the 9th to the 11th centuries , coastal Balts were subjected to raids by the Vikings , and the kings of Denmark collected tribute at times . During the 1011th centuries , Lithuanian territories were among the lands paying tribute to Kievan Rus ' , and Yaroslav the Wise was among the Ruthenian rulers who invaded Lithuania ( from 1040 ) . From the mid-12th century , it was the Lithuanians who were invading Ruthenian territories . In 1183 , Polotsk and Pskov were ravaged , and even the distant and powerful Novgorod Republic was repeatedly threatened by the excursions from the emerging Lithuanian war machine toward the end of the 12th century .
From the late 12th century , an organized Lithuanian military force existed ; it was used for external raids , plundering and the gathering of slaves . Such military and pecuniary activities fostered social differentiation and triggered a struggle for power in Lithuania . This initiated the formation of early statehood , from which the Grand Duchy of Lithuania developed .
Initially inhabited by fragmented Baltic tribes , in the 1230s the Lithuanian lands were united by Mindaugas , who was crowned as King of Lithuania on 6 July 1253 . After his assassination in 1263 , Lithuanian mythology was a target of the Lithuanian Crusade of the Teutonic Knights and the Livonian Order . Siege of Pilnai is noted for the Lithuanians ' defense against the intruders . Despite the devastating century-long struggle with the Orders , the Grand Duchy of Lithuania expanded rapidly , overtaking former Ruthenian principalities of Kievan Rus ' .
On 22 September 1236 , the Battle of Saul between Samogitians and the Livonian Brothers of the Sword took place close to iauliai . The Livonian Brothers were defeated during it and their further conquest of the Balts lands were stopped . The battle inspired rebellions among the Curonians , Semigallians , Selonians , Oeselians , tribes previously conquered by the Sword-Brothers . Some thirty years ' worth of conquests on the left bank of Daugava were lost . In 2000 , the Lithuanian and Latvian parliaments declared 22 September to be the Day of Baltic Unity .
According to the legend , Grand Duke Gediminas was once hunting near the Vilnia River ; tired after the successful hunt , he settled in for the night and dreamed of a huge Iron Wolf ( character ) standing on top a hill and howling as strong and loud as a hundred wolves . Krivis ( pagan priest ) Lizdeika interpreted the dream that the Iron Wolf represents Vilnius Castles . Gediminas , obeying the will of gods , built the city and gave it the name Vilnius  from the stream of the Vilnia River .
In 1362 or 1363 , Grand Duke Algirdas achieved a decisive victory in the Battle of Blue Waters against Golden Horde and stopped its further expansion in the present-day Ukraine . The victory brought the city of Kyiv and a large part of present-day Ukraine , including sparsely populated Podolia and Dykra , under the control of the expanding Grand Duchy of Lithuania . After taking Kyiv , Lithuania became a direct neighbor and rival of the Grand Duchy of Moscow .
By the end of the 14th century , Lithuania was one of the largest countries in Europe and included present-day Belarus , Ukraine , and parts of Poland and Russia . The geopolitical situation between the west and the east determined the multicultural and multi-confessional character of the Grand Duchy of Lithuania . The ruling elite practised religious tolerance and Chancery Slavonic language was used as an auxiliary language to the Latin for official documents .
In 1385 , the Grand Duke Jogaila accepted Poland 's offer to become its king . Jogaila embarked on gradual Christianization of Lithuania and established a personal union between Poland and Lithuania . Lithuania was one of the last Romuva ( religion ) areas of Europe to adopt Christianity .
After two civil wars , Vytautas the Great became the Grand Duke of Lithuania in 1392 . During his reign , Lithuania reached the peak of its territorial expansion , centralization of the state began , and the Lithuanian nobility became increasingly prominent in state politics . In the great Battle of the Vorskla River in 1399 , the combined forces of Tokhtamysh and Vytautas were defeated by the Golden Horde . Thanks to close cooperation , the armies of Lithuania and Poland achieved a victory over the Teutonic Knights in 1410 at the Battle of Grunwald , one of the largest battles of medieval Europe .
In January 1429 , at the Congress of Lutsk Vytautas received the title of King of Lithuania with the backing of Sigismund , Holy Roman Emperor , but the envoys who were transporting the crown were stopped by Polish magnates in autumn of 1430 . Another crown was sent , but Vytautas died in the Trakai Island Castle several days before it reached Lithuania . He was buried in the Cathedral of Vilnius .
After the deaths of Jogaila and Vytautas , the Lithuanian nobility attempted to break the union between Poland and Lithuania , independently selecting Grand Dukes from the Jagiellon dynasty . But , at the end of the 15th century , Lithuania was forced to seek a closer alliance with Poland when the growing power of the Grand Duchy of Moscow threatened Lithuania 's Russian principalities and sparked the MuscoviteLithuanian Wars and the Livonian War .
On 8 September 1514 , Battle of Orsha between Lithuanians , commanded by the Hetmans of the PolishLithuanian Commonwealth Konstanty Ostrogski , and Muscovites was fought . According to Rerum Moscoviticarum Commentarii by Sigismund von Herberstein , the primary source for information on the battle , the much smaller army of PolandLithuania ( under 30,000 men ) defeated a force of 80,000 Muscovite soldiers , capturing their camp and commander . The battle destroyed a military alliance against Lithuania and Poland . Thousands of Muscovites were captured as prisoners and used as labourers in the List of palaces and manor houses in Lithuania , while Konstanty Ostrogski delivered the captured Muscovite flags to the Cathedral of Vilnius .
The Livonian War was ceased for ten years with a Truce of Yam-Zapolsky signed on 15 January 1582 according to which the already PolishLithuanian Commonwealth recovered Livonia , Polotsk and Velizh , but transferred Velikiye Luki to the Tsardom of Russia . The truce was extended for twenty years in 1600 , when a diplomatic mission to Moscow led by Lew Sapieha concluded negotiations with Tsar Boris Godunov . The truce was broken when PolishMuscovite War ( 160518 ) .
===PolishLithuanian Commonwealth===
The PolishLithuanian Commonwealth was created in 1569 by the Union of Lublin . As a member of the Commonwealth , Lithuania retained its institutions , including a separate army , currency , and statutory laws  Statutes of Lithuania . Eventually Polonization affected all aspects of Lithuanian life : politics , language , culture , and national identity . From the mid-16th to the mid-17th centuries , culture , arts , and education flourished , fueled by the Renaissance and the Protestant Reformation . From 1573 , the Kings of Poland and Grand Dukes of Lithuania were free election ( Polish throne ) , who were granted ever increasing Golden Liberty . These liberties , especially the liberum veto , led to anarchy and the eventual dissolution of the state .
The Commonwealth reached its Polish Golden Age in the early 17th century . Its powerful Sejm was dominated by nobles who were reluctant to get involved in the Thirty Years ' War ; this neutrality spared the country from the ravages of a political-religious conflict that devastated most of contemporary Europe . The Commonwealth held its own against Swedish Empire , the Tsardom of Russia , and vassals of the Ottoman Empire , and even launched successful expansionism offensives against its neighbours . In PolishMuscovite War ( 160518 ) during the Time of Troubles , Commonwealth troops entered Russia and managed to take Moscow and hold it from 27 September 1610 to 4 November 1612 , when they were driven out PolishMuscovite War ( 160518 ) # The war resumes ( 1611 ) .
In 1655 , after the extinguishing Battle of Vilnius ( 1655 ) , for the first time in history the Lithuanian capital Vilnius was taken by a foreign army . The Russian army looted the city , splendid churches , and manors . Between 8,000 and 10,000 citizens were killed ; the city burned for 17 days . Those who returned after the catastrophe could not recognise the city . The Russian occupation of the Grand Duchy of Lithuania lasted up to 1661 . Many artefacts and cultural heritage were either lost or looted , significant parts of the state archive  Lithuanian Metrica , collected since the 13th century , were lost and the rest was moved out of the country . During the Second Northern War ( 16551661 ) , the Lithuanian territory and economy were devastated by the Swedish Empire army . Almost all territory of the Grand Duchy of Lithuania was occupied by Swedish and Russian armies . This period is known as Tvanas ( Deluge ( history ) ) .
Before it could fully recover , Lithuania was ravaged during the Great Northern War ( 17001721 ) . The war , Great Northern War plague outbreak , and Great Frost of 1709 caused the deaths of approximately 40 % of the country 's population . Foreign powers , especially Russia , became dominant in the domestic politics of the Commonwealth . Numerous fractions among the nobility used the Golden Liberties to prevent any reforms .
The Constitution of 3 May 1791 was adopted by the Great Sejm ( parliament ) of the PolishLithuanian Commonwealth trying to save the state . The legislation was designed to redress the Commonwealth 's political defects due to the system of Golden Liberties , also known as the `` Nobles ' Democracy , '' had conferred disproportionate rights on the nobility ( szlachta ) and over time had corrupted politics . The constitution sought to supplant the prevailing anarchy fostered by some of the country 's Magnates of Poland and Lithuania with a more democratic constitutional monarchy . It introduced elements of political equality between townspeople and nobility , and placed the peasants under the protection of the government , thus mitigating the worst abuses of serfdom . It banned parliamentary institutions such as the liberum veto , which had put the Sejm at the mercy of any deputy who could revoke all the legislation that had been passed by that Sejm . It was drafted in relation to a copy of the United States Constitution . Others have called it the world 's second-oldest codified national governmental constitution after the 1787 U.S. Constitution .
===Russian Empire===
Eventually , Partitions of Poland in 1772 , 1792 , and 1795 by the Russian Empire , Prussia , and the Habsburg Monarchy .
The largest area of Lithuanian territory became part of the Russian Empire . After the unsuccessful November Uprising and January Uprising , the Tsarist authorities implemented a number of Russification policies . In 1840 the Statutes of Lithuania # Third Statute was abolished . They Lithuanian press ban , closed cultural and educational institutions and made Lithuania part of a new administrative region called Northwestern Krai . The Russification failed owing to an extensive network of Lithuanian book smugglers and secret Lithuanian home schooling .
After the Russo-Turkish War ( 18771878 ) , when German diplomats assigned what were seen as Russian spoils of war to Turkey , the relationship between Russia and the German Empire became complicated . The Russian Empire resumed the construction of fortresses at its western borders for defence against a potential invasion from Germany in the West . On 7 July 1879 the Alexander II of Russia approved a proposal from the Russian military leadership to build the largest `` first-class '' defensive structure in the entire state  the Kaunas Fortress . Large numbers of Lithuanians went to the United States in 18671868 after a famine .
Simonas Daukantas promoted a return to Lithuania 's pre-PolishLithuanian Commonwealth traditions , which he depicted as a Golden Age of Lithuania and a renewal of the native culture , based on the Lithuanian language and customs . With those ideas in mind , he wrote already in 1822 a history of Lithuania in Lithuanian  Darbai senj lietuvi ir emaii ( The Deeds of Ancient Lithuanians and Samogitians ) , though it was not published at that time . A colleague of S. Daukantas , Teodor Narbutt wrote in Polish a voluminous Ancient History of the Lithuanian Nation ( 18351841 ) , where he likewise expounded and expanded further on the concept of historic Lithuania , whose days of glory had ended with the Union of Lublin in 1569 . Narbutt , invoking German scholarship , pointed out the relationship between the Lithuanian and Sanskrit languages . A Lithuanian National Revival , inspired by the ancient Lithuanian history , language and culture , laid the foundations of the modern Lithuanian nation and independent Lithuania .
===20th and 21st centuries===
====19181939====
As a result of the Great Retreat ( Russian ) during World War I , Germany occupied the entire territory of Lithuania and Courland by the end of 1915 . A new administrative entity , Ober Ost , was established . Lithuanians lost all political rights they had gained : personal freedom was restricted , and at the beginning , the Lithuanian press was banned . However , the Lithuanian intelligentsia tried to take advantage of the existing geopolitical situation and began to look for opportunities to restore Lithuania 's independence . On 1822 September 1917 , the Vilnius Conference elected the 20-member Council of Lithuania . The council adopted the Act of Independence of Lithuania on 16 February 1918 which proclaimed the restoration of the independent state of Lithuania governed by democratic principles , with Vilnius as its capital . The state of Lithuania which had been built within the framework of the Act lasted from 1918 until 1940.
Following the capitulation of Germany in November 1918 , the first Provisional Constitution of Lithuania was adopted and the first government of Prime Minister Augustinas Voldemaras was organized . At the same time , the army and other state institutions began to be organized . Lithuania fought Lithuanian Wars of Independence : LithuanianSoviet War who proclaimed the Lithuanian Soviet Socialist Republic ( 19181919 ) , against the West Russian Volunteer Army , and PolishLithuanian War . As a result of the staged eligowski 's Mutiny in October 1920 , Second Polish Republic took control of Vilnius Region and annexed it as Wilno Voivodeship ( 19261939 ) in 1922 . Lithuania continued to claim Vilnius as its de jure capital ( the de facto , provisional capital being Kaunas ) and relations with Poland remained particularly tense and hostile for the entire interwar period . In January 1923 , Lithuania staged the Klaipda Revolt and captured Klaipda Region ( Memel territory ) which was detached from East Prussia by the Treaty of Versailles . The region became an autonomous region of Lithuania .
On 15 May 1920 , the first meeting of the democratically elected Constituent Assembly of Lithuania took place . The documents it adopted , i. e. the temporary ( 1920 ) and permanent ( 1922 ) constitutions of Lithuania , strove to regulate the life of the new state . Land , finance , and educational reforms started to be implemented . The currency of Lithuania , the Lithuanian litas , was introduced . The Vytautas Magnus University was opened . All major public institutions had been established . As Lithuania began to gain stability , foreign countries started to recognize it . In 1921 Lithuania was admitted to the League of Nations .
On 17 December 1926 , a military 1926 Lithuanian coup d'tat coup d'tat took place , resulting in the replacement of the democratically elected government with a conservative authoritarian government led by Antanas Smetona . Augustinas Voldemaras was appointed to form a government . The so-called authoritarian phase had begun strengthening the influence of one party , the Lithuanian Nationalist Union , in the country . In 1927 , the Seimas was dissolved . A new constitution was adopted in 1928 , which consolidated presidential powers . Gradually , opposition parties were banned , censorship was tightened , and the rights of national minorities were narrowed .
On 15 July 1933 , Steponas Darius and Stasys Girnas , Lithuanian pilots , emigrants to the United States , made a significant flight in the Aviation history . They flew across the Atlantic Ocean , covering a distance of without landing , in 37 hours and 11 minutes ( ) . In terms of comparison , as far as the distance of non-stop flights was concerned , their result ranked second only to that of Russell Boardman and John Polando .
The provisional capital Kaunas , which was nicknamed Little Paris , and the country itself had a Western world standard of living with sufficiently high salaries and low prices . At the time , qualified workers there were earning very similar real wages as workers in Germany , Italy , Switzerland and France , the country also had a surprisingly high Rate of natural increase of 9.7 and the industrial production of Lithuania increased by 160 % from 1913 to 1940.
The situation was aggravated by the global economic crisis . The purchase price of agricultural products had declined significantly . In 1935 , farmers began strikes in Suvalkija and Dzkija . In addition to economic ones , political demands were made . The government cruelly suppressed the unrest . In the spring of 1936 , four peasants were sentenced to death for starting the riots .
====19391944====
On 20 March 1939 , after years of rising tensions , Lithuania was handed an ultimatum by Nazi Germany demanding it relinquish the Klaipda Region . Two days later , the Lithuanian government accepted the ultimatum . When Nazi Germany and Soviet Union concluded the MolotovRibbentrop Pact , Lithuania was initially assigned to the German sphere of influence but was later transferred to the Soviet sphere . At the outbreak of World War II , Lithuania declared Neutral powers during World War II .
In October 1939 , Lithuania was forced to sign the SovietLithuanian Mutual Assistance Treaty : five Soviet military bases with 20,000 troops were established in Lithuania in exchange for Vilnius , which the Soviet invasion of Poland . Delayed by the Winter War with Finland , the 1940 Soviet ultimatum to Lithuania on 14 June 1940 . They demanded the replacement of the Lithuanian government and that the Red Army be allowed into the country . The government decided that , with Soviet bases already in Lithuania , armed resistance was impossible and accepted the ultimatum . President Smetona left the country , hoping to form a government in exile , while more than 200,000 Soviet Red Army soldiers crossed the BelarusLithuania border . The next day , identical ultimatums were presented to Latvia and Estonia . The Soviet occupation of the Baltic states ( 1940 ) . The Soviets followed semi-constitutional procedures for transforming the independent countries into soviet republics and incorporating them into the Soviet Union .
Vladimir Dekanozov was sent to supervise the formation of the puppet People 's Government of Lithuania People 's Government and the rigged election to the People 's Seimas . The Lithuanian Soviet Socialist Republic was proclaimed on 21 July and accepted into the Soviet Union on 3 August . Lithuania Sovietization of the Baltic states : political parties and various organizations ( except the Communist Party of Lithuania ) were outlawed , some 12,000 people , including many prominent figures , were arrested and imprisoned in Gulag as `` enemies of the people '' , larger private property was nationalized , the Lithuanian litas was replaced by the Soviet ruble , farm taxes were increased by 50200 % , the Lithuanian Army was transformed into the 29th Rifle Corps ( Soviet Union ) . On 1418 June 1941 , less than a week before the Nazi invasion , some 17,000 Lithuanians were deported to Siberia , where many perished due to inhumane living conditions ( see the June deportation ) . The occupation was not recognized by Western powers and the Lithuanian Diplomatic Service , based on pre-war consulates and legations , continued to represent independent Lithuania until 1990.
When Nazi Germany Operation Barbarossa on 22 June 1941 , Lithuanians began the anti-Soviet June Uprising in Lithuania , organized by the Lithuanian Activist Front . Lithuanians proclaimed independence and organized the Provisional Government of Lithuania . This government quickly self-disbanded . Lithuania became part of the Reichskommissariat Ostland , German civil administration .
By 1 December 1941 , over 120,000 Lithuanian Jews , or 9195 % of Lithuania 's pre-war Jewish community , had been killed . Nearly 100,000 Jews , Poles , Russians and Lithuanians were Ponary massacre . However , thousands of Lithuanian families risking their lives also protected Jews from the Holocaust . Israel has recognized 893 Lithuanians ( as of 1 January 2018 ) as Righteous Among the Nations for risking their lives to save Jews during the Holocaust .
Approximately 13,000 men served in the Lithuanian Auxiliary Police Battalions . 10 of the 26 Lithuanian Auxiliary Police Battalions working with the Nazi Einsatzkommando , were involved in the mass killings . Rogue units organised by Algirdas Klimaitis and supervised by SS Brigadefhrer Walter Stahlecker started the Kaunas pogrom in and around Kaunas on 25 June 1941 . In 1941 , the Lithuanian Security Police ( Lietuvos saugumo policija ) , subordinate to Nazi Germany 's Security Police and Nazi Germany 's Criminal Police , was created . The Lietuvos saugumo policija targeted the communist underground .
A new occupation had begun . Nationalized assets were not returned to the residents . Some of them were forced to fight for Nazi Germany or were taken to German territories as forced labourers . Jews people were herded into ghettos and gradually killed by shooting or sending them out to concentration camps .
====19441990====
After the retreat of the Wehrmacht , the Occupation and annexation of the Baltic states by the Soviet Union ( 1944 ) in JulyOctober 1944 . The Deportation to Siberia were resumed and lasted until the death of Joseph Stalin in 1953 . Antanas Sniekus , the leader of the Communist Party of Lithuania from 1940 to 1974 , supervised the arrests and deportations . All Lithuanian national symbols were banned . Under the pretext of Lithuania 's economic recovery , the Moscow authorities encouraged the migration of workers and other specialists to Lithuania with the intention to further integrate Lithuania into the Soviet Union and to develop the country 's industry . At the same time , Lithuanians were lured to work in the USSR by promising them all the privileges of settling in a new place .
The second Soviet occupation was accompanied by the Lithuanian partisans of the Lithuanian population , which took place in 19441953 . It sought to restore an independent state of Lithuania , to consolidate democracy by destroying communism in the country , returning national values and the freedom of religion . About 50,000 Lithuanians took to the forests and fought Soviet occupants with a gun in their hands . In the later stages of the partisan war , Lithuanians formed the Union of Lithuanian Freedom Fighters and its leader Jonas emaitis ( codename Vytautas ) was posthumously recognized as the president of Lithuania . Despite the fact that the guerrilla warfare did not achieve its goal of liberating Lithuania and that it resulted in more than 20,000 deaths , the armed resistance de facto demonstrated that Lithuania did not voluntarily join the USSR and it also legitimized the will of the people of Lithuania to be independent . Lithuanian courts and the European Court of Human Rights both treat the Soviets ' annihilation of the Lithuanian partisans as a genocide .
Even with the suppression of partisan resistance , the Soviet government failed to stop the movement for the independence of Lithuania . The underground dissident groups were active publishing the underground press and Catholic literature . The most active participants of the movement included Vincentas Sladkeviius , Sigitas Tamkeviius and Nijol Sadnait . In 1972 , after Romas Kalanta Romas Kalanta 's public self-immolation , the unrest in Kaunas lasted for several days .
The Lithuanian Helsinki Group , which was founded in Lithuania after the international conference in Helsinki ( Finland ) , where the post-WWII borders were acknowledged , announced a declaration for Lithuania 's independence on foreign radio station . The Helsinki Group informed the Western world about the situation in the Soviet Lithuania and violations of human rights . With the beginning of the increased openness and transparency in government institutions and activities ( glasnost ) in the Soviet Union , on 3 June 1988 , the Sjdis was established in Lithuania . Very soon it began to seek country 's independence . Vytautas Landsbergis became movement 's leader . The supporters of Sjdis joined movement 's groups all over Lithuania . On 23 August 1988 a big rally took place at the Vingis Park in Vilnius . It was attended by approx . 250,000 people . A year later , on 23 August 1989 commemorating the 50th anniversary of the MolotovRibbentrop Pact Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact and aiming to draw the attention of the whole world to the occupation of the Baltic states , a political demonstration , the Baltic Way , was organized . The event , led by Sjdis , was a human chain spanning across Vilnius , Riga and Tallinn , indicating the desire of the people of Lithuania , Latvia , and Estonia to break away from the Soviet Union .
====1990present====
On 11 March 1990 , the Supreme Council  Reconstituent Seimas announced the restoration of Lithuania 's independence . Lithuania became the first Soviet occupied state to announce restitution of independence . On 20 April 1990 , the Soviets imposed an Blockade by ceasing to deliver supplies of raw materials ( primarily oil ) to Lithuania . Not only the domestic industry , but also the population started feeling the lack of fuel , essential goods , and even hot water . Although the blockade lasted for 74 days , Lithuania did not renounce the declaration of independence .
Gradually , economic relations had been restored . However , tensions had peaked again in January 1991 . At that time , attempts were made to carry out a coup using the Soviet Armed Forces , the Internal Army of the Ministry of Internal Affairs and the USSR Committee for State Security ( KGB ) . Because of the poor economic situation in Lithuania , the forces in Moscow thought the coup d'tat would receive strong public support .
People from all over Lithuania flooded to Vilnius to defend their legitimately elected Supreme Council  Reconstituent Seimas and independence . The coup ended with a few casualties of peaceful civilians and caused huge material loss . Not a single person who defended Seimas or other state institutions used a weapon , but the Soviet Army did . Soviet soldiers killed 14 people and injured hundreds . A large part of the Lithuanian population participated in the January Events ( Lithuania ) . Shortly after , on 11 February 1991 , the Alingi voted to confirm that Iceland 's 1922 recognition of Lithuanian independence was still in full effect , as it never formally recognized the Soviet Union 's control over Lithuania , and that full diplomatic relations should be established as soon as possible .
On 31 July 1991 , Soviet paramilitaries killed seven Lithuanian border guards on the Belarusian border in what became known as the Medininkai Massacre . On 17 September 1991 , Lithuania was admitted to the United Nations .

On 31 August 1993 the last units of the Soviet Army left the territory of Lithuania . Since 29 March 2004 , Lithuania has been part of the NATO . On 1 May 2004 , it became a fully-fledged member of the European Union , and a member of the Schengen Agreement on 21 December 2007.
==Geography==
Lithuania is located in the Baltic region of Europe and covers an area of . It lies between latitudes 53rd parallel north 53 and 57th parallel north 57 N , and mostly between longitudes 21st meridian east 21 and 27th meridian east 27 E ( part of the Curonian Spit lies west of 21 ) . It has around of sandy coastline , only about of which face the open Baltic Sea , less than the other two Baltic Sea countries . The rest of the coast is sheltered by the Curonian sand peninsula . Lithuania 's major warm-water port , Klaipda , lies at the narrow mouth of the Curonian Lagoon ( Lithuanian : Kuri marios ) , a shallow lagoon extending south to Kaliningrad . The country 's main and largest river , the Nemunas River , and some of its tributaries carry international shipping .
Lithuania lies at the edge of the North European Plain . Its landscape was smoothed by the glaciers of the last glacial period , and is a combination of moderate lowlands and highlands . Its highest point is Auktojas Hill at in the eastern part of the country . The terrain features List of lakes in Lithuania ( Lake Vitytis , for example ) and wetlands , and a mixed forest zone covers over 33 % of the country . Drkiai is the largest , Tauragnas is the deepest and Asveja is the longest lake in Lithuania .
After a re-estimation of the boundaries of the continent of Europe in 1989 , Jean-George Affholder , a scientist at the Institut gographique national ( France ) ( French National Geographic Institute ) , determined that the geographic centre of Europe was in Lithuania , at , north of Lithuania 's capital city of Vilnius . Affholder accomplished this by calculating the centre of gravity of the Geography of Europe of Europe .
===Climate===
Lithuania has a temperate climate with both maritime climate and continental climate influences . It is defined as [ continental climate humid continental ] ( Dfb ) under the Kppen climate classification ( but is close to oceanic climate in a narrow coastal zone ) .
Average temperatures on the coast are in January and in July . In Vilnius the average temperatures are in January and in July . During the summer , is common during the day while is common at night ; in the past , temperatures have reached as high as . Some winters can be very cold . occurs almost every winter . Winter extremes are in coastal areas and in the east of Lithuania .
The average annual precipitation is on the coast , in the Samogitia highlands and in the eastern part of the country . Snow occurs every year , it can snow from October to April . In some years sleet can fall in September or May . The growing season lasts 202 days in the western part of the country and 169 days in the eastern part . Severe storms are rare in the eastern part of Lithuania but common in the coastal areas .
The longest records of measured temperature in the Baltic area cover about 250 years . The data show warm periods during the latter half of the 18th century , and that the 19th century was a relatively cool period . An early 20th century warming culminated in the 1930s , followed by a smaller cooling that lasted until the 1960s . A warming trend has persisted since then .
Lithuania experienced a drought in 2002 , causing forest and peat bog fires . The country suffered along with the rest of Northwestern Europe during a heat wave in the summer of 2006.
===Environment===
After the restoration of Lithuania 's independence in 1990 , the Aplinkos apsaugos statymas ( Environmental Protection Act ) was adopted already in 1992 . The law provided the foundations for regulating social relations in the field of environmental protection , established the basic rights and obligations of legal and natural persons in preserving the biodiversity inherent in Lithuania , ecological systems and the landscape . Lithuania agreed to cut carbon emissions by at least 20 % of 1990 levels by the year 2020 and by at least 40 % by the year 2030 , together with all European Union members . Also , by 2020 at least 20 % ( 27 % by 2030 ) of country 's total energy consumption should be from the renewable energy sources . In 2016 , Lithuania introduced especially effective container deposit legislation , which resulted in collecting 92 % of all packagings in 2017.
Lithuania does not have high mountains and its landscape is dominated by blooming meadows , dense forests and fertile fields of cereals . However it stands out by the abundance of [ which previously had castles where the ancient Lithuanians burned altars for pagan gods . Lithuania is a particularly watered region with more than 3,000 lakes , mostly in the northeast . The country is also drained by numerous rivers , most notably the longest Nemunas ] . Lithuania is home to two terrestrial ecoregions : [ [ Central European mixed forests and Sarmatic mixed forests .
Forest has long been one of the most important natural resources in Lithuania . Forests occupy one third of the country 's territory and timber-related industrial production accounts for almost 11 % industrial production in the country . Lithuania has five national parks , 30 regional parks , 402 nature reserves , 668 state-protected natural heritage objects .
Lithuania is ranked fifth , second to Sweden ( first 3 places are not granted ) in Climate Change Performance Index ( CCPI ) . It had a 2019 Forest Landscape Integrity Index mean score of 1.62/10 , ranking it 162nd globally out of 172 countries .
===Biodiversity===
Lithuanian ecosystems include natural and semi-natural ( forests , bogs , wetlands and meadows ) , and anthropogenic ( agrarian and urban ) ecosystems . Among natural ecosystems , forests are particularly important to Lithuania , covering 33 % of the country 's territory . Wetlands ( raised bogs , fens , transitional mires , etc . ) cover 7.9 % of the country , with 70 % of wetlands having been lost due to drainage and peat extraction between 1960 and 1980 . Changes in wetland plant communities resulted in the replacement of moss and grass communities by trees and shrubs , and fens not directly affected by land reclamation have become drier as a result of a drop in the water table . There are 29,000 rivers with a total length of 64,000 ; km in Lithuania , the Nemunas River basin occupying 74 % of the territory of the country . Due to the construction of dams , approximately 70 % of spawning sites of potential catadromous fish species have disappeared . In some cases , river and lake ecosystems continue to be impacted by anthropogenic eutrophication .
Agricultural land comprises 54 % of Lithuania 's territory ( roughly 70 % of that is arable land and 30 % meadows and pastures ) , approximately 400,000 ha of agricultural land is not farmed , and acts as an ecological niche for weeds and invasive plant species . Habitat deterioration is occurring in regions with very productive and expensive lands as crop areas are expanded . Currently , 18.9 % of all plant species , including 1.87 % of all known fungi species and 31 % of all known species of lichens , are listed in the List of extinct and endangered species of Lithuania . The list also contains 8 % of all fish species .
The wildlife populations have rebounded as the hunting became more restricted and urbanization allowed replanting forests ( forests already tripled in size since their lows ) . Currently , Lithuania has approximately 250,000 larger wild animals or 5 per each square kilometer . The most prolific large wild animal in every part of Lithuania is the roe deer , with 120,000 of them . They are followed by boars ( 55,000 ) . Other ungulates are the deer ( ~22,000 ) , fallow-deer ( ~21,000 ) and the largest one : moose ( ~7,000 ) . Among the Lithuanian predators , foxes are the most common ( ~27,000 ) . Wolves are , however , more ingrained into the mythology as there are just 800 in Lithuania . Even rarer are the lynxes ( ~200 ) . The large animals mentioned above exclude the rabbit , ~200,000 of which may live in the Lithuanian forests .
==Politics==
===Government===
Since Lithuania declared the restoration of its independence on 11 March 1990 , it has maintained strong democratic traditions . It held its first independent general elections on 25 October 1992 , in which 56.75 % of voters supported the Constitution of Lithuania . There were intense debates concerning the constitution , particularly the role of the president . A 1992 Lithuanian presidency referendum was held on 23 May 1992 to gauge public opinion on the matter , and 41 % of voters supported the restoration of the President of Lithuania . Through compromise , a semi-presidential system was agreed on .
The Lithuanian [ of state ] is the president , directly elected for a five-year term and serving a maximum of two terms .

In 2001 , the Civil Code of Lithuania was passed in Seimas . It was succeeded by the Criminal Code and Criminal Procedure Code in 2003 . The approach to the criminal law is inquisitorial , as opposed to Adversarial system ; it is generally characterised by an insistence on formality and rationalisation , as opposed to practicality and informality . Normative legal act enters into force on the next day after its publication in the Teiss akt registras , unless it has a later entry into force date .
The European Union law is an integral part of the Lithuanian legal system since 1 May 2004.
Lithuania , after breaking away from the Soviet Union had a difficult crime situation , however the Lithuanian law enforcement agencies eliminated many criminals over the years , making Lithuania a reasonably safe country . Crime in Lithuania has been declining rapidly . Law enforcement in Lithuania is primarily the responsibility of local Lietuvos policija ( Lithuanian Police ) commissariats . They are supplemented by the Lietuvos policijos antiteroristini operacij rinktin Aras ( Anti-Terrorist Operations Team of the Lithuanian Police Aras ) , Lietuvos kriminalins policijos biuras ( Lithuanian Criminal Police Bureau ) , Lietuvos policijos kriminalistini tyrim centras ( Lithuanian Police Forensic Research Center ) and Lietuvos keli policijos tarnyba ( Lithuanian Road Police Service ) .

===Administrative divisions===
The current system of administrative division was established in 1994 and modified in 2000 to meet the requirements of the European Union .

Municipalities have been the most important unit of administration in Lithuania since the system of County governor ( Lithuania ) ( apskrities virininkas ) was dissolved in 2010 . Some municipalities are historically called `` district municipalities '' ( often shortened to `` district '' ) , while others are called `` city municipalities '' ( sometimes shortened to `` city '' ) . Each has its own elected government . The election of municipality councils originally occurred every three years , but now takes place every four years . The council appoints elder ( administrative title ) to govern the elderships . Mayors have been directly elected since 2015 ; prior to that , they were appointed by the council .
Elderships , numbering over 500 , are the smallest administrative units and do not play a role in national politics . They provide necessary local public servicesfor example , registering births and deaths in rural areas . They are most active in the social sector , identifying needy individuals or families and organizing and distributing welfare and other forms of relief . Some citizens feel that elderships have no real power and receive too little attention , and that they could otherwise become a source of local initiative for addressing rural problems .

The population ages 6 to 19 has decreased by 36 % between 2005 and 2015 . As a result , the student-teacher ratio is decreasing and expenditure per student is increasing , but schools , particularly in rural areas , are forced into reorganizations and consolidations . As with other Baltic states nations , in particular Latvia , the large volume of higher education graduates within the country , coupled with the high rate of spoken second languages is contributing to an education brain drain .

Montenegro ( ; , ) is a country in southeast Europe on the Adriatic Sea coast of the Balkans . It borders Bosnia and Herzegovina to the north , Serbia to the northeast , Kosovo to the east , Albania to the southeast , the Adriatic Sea and Croatia to the west . The largest and capital city Podgorica covers 10.4 % of Montenegro 's territory and is home to 29.9 % of the country 's population , while Cetinje has the status of old royal capital . Major group in the country are Montenegrins . Serbs of Montenegro form a significant minority at 28.7 % , followed by Bosniaks , Albanians and Croats .
During the Early Medieval period , three principalities were located on the territory of modern-day Montenegro : Duklja , roughly corresponding to the southern half ; Travunia , the west ; and Principality of Serbia ( early medieval ) proper , the north . The Zeta under the Balii emerged in the 14th and 15th centuries . The name Montenegro was first used to refer to the country in the late 15th century . After falling under Ottoman rule , Montenegro regained its independence in 1696 under the rule of the House of Petrovi-Njego , first as a Prince-Bishopric of Montenegro and later as a secular Principality of Montenegro . Montenegro 's independence was recognized by the Great Powers at the Congress of Berlin in 1878 . In 1910 , the country became a Kingdom of Montenegro . After World War I , it became part of Kingdom of Yugoslavia . Following the breakup of Yugoslavia , the republics of Republic of Serbia ( 19922006 ) and Republic of Montenegro ( 19922006 ) together proclaimed a Serbia and Montenegro . Following the Montenegrin independence referendum , 2006 held in May 2006 , Montenegro declared its independence and the confederation peacefully dissolved .
Classified by the World Bank as an upper middle-income country , Montenegro is a member of the UN , NATO , the World Trade Organization , the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe , the Council of Europe , and the Central European Free Trade Agreement . Montenegro is a founding member of the Union for the Mediterranean . It is also in the Accession of Montenegro to the European Union the European Union .
== Etymology ==
The country 's English name derives from Venetian language and translates as `` Black Mountain '' , deriving from the appearance of Loven when covered in dense evergreen forests . In the monuments of Kotor , Montenegro was mentioned as Montenegro in 1397 , as Monte Nigro in 1443 and as Crna Gora in 1435 and 1458 , but there are much older papers of Latin sources where Montenegro is mentioned as Monte nigro . The first mention of Montenegro ( as Monte nigro ) dates to 9 November 1053 in a papal epistle and the others date to 1061 , 1097 , 1121 , 1125 , 1144 , 1154 , 1179 and 1189.
The native name Crna Gora , also meaning `` black mountain '' or `` black hill '' , came to denote the majority of contemporary Montenegro in the 15th century . Originally , it had referred to only a small strip of land under the rule of the Patrovii tribe , but the name eventually came to be used for the wider mountainous region after the Crnojevi noble family took power in Upper Zeta . The aforementioned region became known as Stara Crna Gora 'Old Montenegro ' by the 19th century to distinguish the independent region from the neighbouring Ottoman-occupied Montenegrin territory of Brda ' ( The ) Highlands ' . Montenegro further increased its size several times by the 20th century , as the result of wars against the Ottoman Empire , which saw the annexation of Old Herzegovina and parts of Metohija and southern Raka ( region ) . Its borders have changed little since then , losing Metohija and gaining the Bay of Kotor .
After the second session of the Anti-Fascist Council for the National Liberation of Yugoslavia during World War II in Yugoslavia , the contemporary modern state of Montenegro was founded as the Federal State of Montenegro ( Montenegrin language :     / Savezna drava Crne Gore ) on 15 November 1943 within the Yugoslav Federation by the State Anti-fascist Council for the National Liberation of Montenegro and Boka . After the war , Montenegro became a republic under its name , the Socialist Republic of Montenegro People 's Republic of Montenegro ( Montenegrin language :     / Narodna Republika Crna Gora ) on 29 November 1945 . In 1963 , it was renamed to the Socialist Republic of Montenegro ( Montenegrin language :     / Socijalistika Republika Crna Gora ) . As the breakup of Yugoslavia occurred , the SRCG was renamed to the Republic of Montenegro ( Montenegrin language :    / Republika Crna Gora ) on 27 April 1992 within the Serbia and Montenegro by removing the adjective `` socialist '' from the republic 's title . Since 22 October 2007 , a year after its independence , the name of the country became simply known as Montenegro .
The ISO 3166-1 alpha-2 ISO Alpha-2 code for Montenegro is ME and the ISO 3166-1 alpha-3 Alpha-3 Code is MNE .
== History ==
=== Arrival of the Slavs ===
Three Slavs principalities were located on the territory : Duklja , roughly corresponding to the southern half , Travunia , the west , and Principality of Serbia ( early medieval ) , the north . Duklja gained its independence from the Byzantine Roman Empire in 1042 . Over the next few decades , it expanded its territory to neighbouring Rascia and Bosnia , and also became recognised as a kingdom . Its power started declining at the beginning of the 12th century . After King Bodin 's death ( in 1101 or 1108 ) , several civil wars ensued . Duklja reached its zenith under Vojislav 's son , Mihailo I of Duklja ( 104681 ) , and his grandson Constantine Bodin ( 10811101 ) .
As the nobility fought for the throne , the kingdom was weakened , and by 1186 , the territory of modern-day Montenegro became part of the state ruled by Stefan Nemanja and was a part of various state formations ruled by the Nemanji dynasty for the next two centuries . After the Serbian Empire collapsed in the second half of the 14th century , the most powerful Zetan family , the Balis , became sovereigns of Zeta .
By the 13th century , Zeta had replaced Duklja when referring to the realm . In the late 14th century , southern Montenegro ( Lordship of Zeta ) came under the rule of the Bali noble family , then the Crnojevi noble family , and by the 15th century , Zeta was more often referred to as Crna Gora ( Venetian language : monte negro ) .
In 1421 , Zeta was annexed to the Serbian Despotate , but after 1455 , another noble family from Zeta , the Crnojevis , became sovereign rulers of the country , making it the last free monarchy of the Balkans before it fell to the Ottomans in 1496 , and got annexed to the sanjak of Shkodr . During the reign of Crnojevis , Zeta became known under its current name ;  Montenegro . For a short time , Montenegro existed as a separate autonomous sanjak in 15141528 ( Sanjak of Montenegro ) . Also , Old Herzegovina region was part of Sanjak of Herzegovina .
=== Ottoman period ===
Large portions fell under the control of the Ottoman Empire from 1496 to 1878 . In the 16th century , Montenegro developed a unique form of autonomy within the Ottoman Empire permitting Montenegrin clans freedom from certain restrictions . Nevertheless , the Montenegrins were disgruntled with Ottoman rule , and in the 17th century , raised numerous rebellions , which culminated in the defeat of the Ottomans in the Great Turkish War at the end of that century .
Montenegro consisted of territories controlled by warlike clans . Most clans had a chieftain ( knez ) , who was not permitted to assume the title unless he proved to be as worthy a leader as his predecessor . The great assembly of Montenegrin clans ( Zbor ) was held every year on 12 July in Cetinje , and any adult clansman could take part .
Parts of the territory were controlled by Republic of Venice and the First French Empire and Austria-Hungary , its successors . In 1515 , Montenegro became a theocracy led by the Metropolitanate of Montenegro and the Littoral , which flourished after the Petrovi-Njego of Cetinje became the traditional prince-bishops ( whose title was `` Vladika of Montenegro '' ) . However , the Venetian Republic introduced governors who meddled in Montenegrin politics . The republic was succeeded by the Austrian Empire in 1797 , and the governors were abolished by Prince-Bishop Petar II Petrovi-Njego in 1832.
People from Montenegro in this historical period have been described as Orthodox Serbs .
=== Principality and Kingdom of Montenegro===
Under Nicholas I of Montenegro ( ruled 18601918 ) , the principality was enlarged several times in the Montenegro-Turkish Wars and was recognised as independent in 1878 . Nicholas I established diplomatic relations with the Ottoman Empire .
Minor border skirmishes excepted , diplomacy ushered in about 30 years of peace between the two states until the deposition of Abdul Hamid II in 1909.
The political skills of Abdul Hamid II and Nicholas I played a major role in the mutually amicable relations . Modernization of the state followed , culminating with the draft of a Constitution in 1905 . However , political rifts emerged between the reigning People 's Party of Montenegro People 's Party , who supported the process of democratization and union with Serbia , and those of the True People 's Party , who were monarchist .
In 1858 one of the major Montenegrin victories over the Ottomans occurred at the Battle of Grahovac . Mirko Petrovi Njego , elder brother of Knjaz Danilo , led an army of 7,500 and defeated the numerically superior Ottomans with 15,000 troops at Grahovac on 1 May 1858 . This forced the Great Powers to officially demarcate the borders between Montenegro and Ottoman Empire , de facto recognizing Montenegro 's independence .
In the Battle of Vuji Do Montenegrins inflicted major defeat to the Ottoman Army under Grand Vizier Ahmed Muhtar Pasha . In the aftermath of the Russian victory against the Ottoman Empire in the Russo-Turkish War of 18771878 , the great powers of Europe restructured the map of the Balkan region . The Ottoman Empire recognized independence of Montenegro in the Treaty of Berlin ( 1878 ) in 1878.
The first Montenegrin constitution ( also known as the Danilo Code ) was proclaimed in 1855.
In 1910 Montenegro became Kingdom of Montenegro , and as a result of the Balkan wars in 1912 and 1913 ( in which the Ottomans lost most of their Balkan lands ) , a common border with Serbia was established , with Shkodr being awarded to a newly created Albania , though the current capital city of Montenegro , Podgorica , was on the old border of Albania and Yugoslavia . Montenegro became one of the Allies of World War I during World War I ( 191418 ) . In the Battle of Mojkovac fought in January 1916 between Austria-Hungary and the Kingdom of Montenegro , Montenegrins achieved decisive victory despite being outnumbered five to one . From 1916 to October 1918 Austria-Hungary occupied Montenegro . During the occupation , King Nicholas fled the country and a government-in-exile was set up in Bordeaux .
=== Kingdom of Yugoslavia ===
In 1922 , Montenegro formally became the Zeta Oblast in the Kingdom of Serbs , Croats and Slovenes , with the addition of the coastal areas around Budva and Bay of Kotor . In a further restructuring in 1929 , it became a part of a larger Zeta Banovina of the Kingdom of Yugoslavia that reached the Neretva River .
Nicholas 's grandson , the Serb King Alexander I of Yugoslavia , dominated the Yugoslav government . Zeta Banovina was one of nine banovinas which formed the kingdom ; it consisted of the present-day Montenegro and parts of Serbia , Croatia , and Bosnia .
=== World War II and Socialist Yugoslavia===
In April 1941 , Nazi Germany , the Kingdom of Italy , and other Axis allies attacked and occupied the Kingdom of Yugoslavia . Italian forces occupied Montenegro and established it as a puppet Italian governorate of Montenegro .
In May , the Montenegrin branch of the Communist Party of Yugoslavia started preparations for an uprising planned for mid-July . The Communist Party and its Youth League organised 6,000 of its members into detachments prepared for guerrilla warfare . According to some historians , the first armed uprising in Nazi Germany-occupied Europe happened on 13 July 1941 in Montenegro .
Unexpectedly , the uprising took hold , and by 20 July , 32,000 men and women had joined the fight . Except for the coast and major towns ( Podgorica , Cetinje , Pljevlja , and Niki ) , which were besieged , Montenegro was mostly liberated . In a month of fighting , the Italian army suffered 5,000 dead , wounded , and captured . The uprising lasted until mid-August , when it was suppressed by a counter-offensive of 67,000 Italian troops brought in from Albania . Faced with new and overwhelming Italian forces , many of the fighters laid down their arms and returned home . Nevertheless , intense guerrilla fighting lasted until December .
Fighters who remained under arms fractured into two groups . Most of them went on to join the Yugoslav Partisans , consisting of communists and those inclined towards active resistance ; these included Arso Jovanovi , Sava Kovaevi ( Yugoslav Partisan ) , Svetozar Vukmanovi-Tempo , Milovan ilas , Peko Dapevi , Vlado Dapevi , Veljko Vlahovi , and Blao Jovanovi . Those loyal to the Karaorevi dynasty and opposing communism went on to become Chetniks , and turned to collaboration with Italians against the Partisans .
War broke out between Partisans and Chetniks during the first half of 1942 . Pressured by Italians and Chetniks , the core of the Montenegrin Partisans went to Serbia and Bosnia , where they joined with other Yugoslav Partisans . Fighting between Partisans and Chetniks continued through the war . Chetniks with Italian backing controlled most of the country from mid-1942 to April 1943 . Montenegrin Chetniks received the status of `` anti-communist militia '' and received weapons , ammunition , food rations , and money from Italy . Most of them were moved to Mostar , where they fought in the Battle of Neretva against the Partisans , but were dealt a heavy defeat .
During the German operation Schwartz against the Partisans in May and June 1943 , Germans disarmed large number of Chetniks without fighting , as they feared they would turn against them in case of an Allied invasion of the Balkans . After the capitulation of Italy in September 1943 , Partisans managed to take hold of most of Montenegro for a brief time , but Montenegro was soon German occupied territory of Montenegro , and fierce fighting continued during late 1943 and entire 1944 . Montenegro was liberated by the Partisans in December 1944.
Montenegro became one of the six constituent republics of the communist Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia ( SFRY ) . Its capital became Podgorica , renamed Titograd in honour of President Josip Broz Tito . After the war , the infrastructure of Yugoslavia was rebuilt , industrialization began , and the University of Montenegro was established . Greater autonomy was established until the Socialist Republic of Montenegro ratified a new constitution in 1974.
=== Montenegro within FR Yugoslavia ===
After the dissolution of the SFRY in 1992 , Montenegro remained part of a smaller Federal Republic of Yugoslavia along with Serbia .
In the Montenegrin independence referendum , 1992 , the turnout was 66 % , with 96 % of the votes cast in favour of the federation with Serbia . The referendum was boycotted by the Muslim , Albanian , and Catholic minorities , as well as the pro-independence Montenegrins . The opponents claimed that the poll was organized under anti-Democracy with widespread propaganda from the state-controlled media in favour of a pro-federation vote . No impartial report on the fairness of the referendum was made , as it was unmonitored , unlike in a later 2006 referendum when European Union observers were present .
During the 19911995 Bosnian War and Croatian War , Montenegrin police and military forces joined Serbian troops in the attacks on Dubrovnik , Croatia . These operations , aimed at acquiring more territory , were characterized by a consistent pattern of large-scale violations of human rights .
Montenegrin General Pavle Strugar was convicted for his part in the bombing of Dubrovnik .
Bosnian refugees were arrested by Montenegrin police and transported to Serb camps in Foa ethnic cleansing , where they were subjected to systematic torture and executed .
In 1996 , Milo ukanovi 's government severed ties between Montenegro and its partner Serbia , which was led by Slobodan Miloevi . Montenegro formed its own economic policy and adopted the German Deutsche Mark as its currency and subsequently Montenegro and the euro , although not part of the Eurozone currency union . Subsequent governments pursued pro-independence policies , and political tensions with Serbia simmered despite the political changes in Belgrade .
Targets in Montenegro were bombed by NATO forces during Operation Allied Force in 1999 , although the extent of these attacks was limited in both time and area affected .
In 2002 , Serbia and Montenegro came to a new agreement for continued cooperation and entered into negotiations regarding the future status of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia . This resulted in the Belgrade Agreement , which saw the country 's transformation into a more decentralised state union named Serbia and Montenegro in 2003 . The Belgrade Agreement also contained a provision delaying any future referendum on the independence of Montenegro for at least three years .
=== Independence and recent history ===
The status of the union between Montenegro and Serbia was decided by a Montenegrin independence referendum , 2006 on 21 May 2006 . A total of 419,240 votes were cast , representing 86.5 % of the total electorate ; 230,661 votes ( 55.5 % ) were for independence and 185,002 votes ( 44.5 % ) were against . This narrowly surpassed the 55 % threshold needed to validate the referendum under the rules set by the European Union . According to the electoral commission , the 55 % threshold was passed by only 2,300 votes . Serbia , the member-states of the European Union , and the permanent members of the United Nations Security Council all diplomatic recognition Montenegro 's independence .

The Law on the Status of the Descendants of the Petrovi Njego Dynasty was passed by the Parliament of Montenegro on 12 July 2011 . It rehabilitated the House of Petrovi-Njego and recognized limited symbolic roles within the constitutional framework of the republic .
In 2015 , the investigative journalists ' network Organized Crime and Corruption Reporting Project named Montenegro 's long-time President and Prime Minister Milo ukanovi `` Person of the Year in Organized Crime '' . The extent of ukanovi 's corruption led to street demonstrations and calls for his removal .

In 2017 , fourteen people , including two Russian nationals and two Montenegrin opposition leaders , Andrija Mandi and Milan Kneevi ( Montenegrin politician ) , were indicted for their alleged roles in the coup attempt on charges such as `` preparing a conspiracy against the constitutional order and the security of Montenegro '' and an `` attempted terrorist act . ''
Montenegro formally MontenegroNATO relations of NATO in June 2017 , though `` Montenegro remains deeply divided over joining NATO '' , an event that triggered a promise of retaliatory actions on the part of Russia 's government .

In its political rights and civil liberties worldwide report in May 2020 , Freedom House marked Montenegro as a [ regime ] rather than a democracy because of declining standards in governance , justice , elections , and media freedom . For the first time in three decades , in the 2020 Montenegrin parliamentary election , the opposition won more votes than ukanovi 's ruling party .

After the promulgation of the Declaration of Independence in the Parliament of the Republic of Montenegro on 3 June 2006 , following the independence referendum held on 21 May , the Government of the Republic of Montenegro assumed the competences of defining and conducting the foreign policy of Montenegro as a subject of international law and a sovereign state . The implementation of this constitutional responsibility was vested in the Ministry of Foreign Affairs , which was given the task of defining the foreign policy priorities and activities needed for their implementation . These activities are pursued in close cooperation with other state administration authorities , the President , the Speaker of the Parliament , and other relevant stakeholders .
Integration into the European Union is Montenegro 's strategic goal . This process will remain in the focus of Montenegrin foreign policy in the short term .
The second strategic and equally important goal , but one attainable in a shorter time span , was joining NATO , which would guarantee stability and security for pursuing other strategic goals . Montenegro believes NATO integration would speed up EU integration . In May 2017 NATO accepted Montenegro as a NATO member starting 5 June 2017.
=== Symbols ===
An official flag of Montenegro , based on the royal standard of King Nicholas I , was adopted on 12 July 2004 by the Montenegrin legislature . This royal flag was red with a silver border , a silver coat of arms , and the initials  , in Cyrillic script ( corresponding to NI in Latin script ) , representing King Nicholas I . On the current flag , the border and arms are in gold and the royal cipher in the centre of the arms has been replaced with a golden lion .
The national day of Statehood Day ( Montenegro ) marks the date in 1878 when the Congress of Berlin recognized Montenegro as the 27th independent state in the world and the start of one of the first popular uprisings in Europe against the Axis Powers on 13 July 1941 in Montenegro .
In 2004 , the Montenegrin legislature selected a popular Montenegrin traditional song , `` Oj , svijetla majska zoro Oh , Bright Dawn of May '' , as the national anthem . Montenegro 's official anthem during the reign of King Nicholas I was Ubavoj nam Crnoj Gori ( `` To Our Beautiful Montenegro '' ) .
=== Military ===
The military of Montenegro is a fully professional standing army under the Ministry of Defence ( Montenegro ) and is composed of the Montenegrin Ground Army , the Montenegrin Navy , and the Montenegrin Air Force , along with special forces . Conscription was abolished in 2006 . The military currently maintains a force of 1,920 active duty members . The bulk of its equipment and forces were inherited from the armed forces of the State Union of Serbia and Montenegro ; as Montenegro contained the entire coastline of the former union , it retained practically the entire naval force .
Montenegro was a member of NATO 's Partnership for Peace program and then became an official candidate for full membership in the alliance . Montenegro applied for a Membership Action Plan on 5 November 2008 , which was granted in December 2009 . Montenegro is also a member of Adriatic Charter . Montenegro was invited to join NATO on 2 December 2015 and on 19 May 2016 , NATO and Montenegro conducted a signing ceremony at NATO headquarters in Brussels for Montenegro 's membership invitation . Montenegro became NATO 's 29th Member states of NATO on 5 June 2017 , despite Russia 's objections . The government plans to have the army participate in peacekeeping missions through the UN and NATO such as the International Security Assistance Force .
=== Administrative divisions ===
Montenegro is divided into twenty-three municipalities ( optina ) . This includes 21 District-level Municipalities and 2 Urban Municipalities , with two subdivisions of municipality of Podgorica , listed below . Each municipality can contain multiple cities and towns . Historically , the territory of the country was divided into `` nahije '' .

=== Cities in Montenegro ===
== Economy ==
The economy of Montenegro is mostly Tertiary sector of the economy service-based and is in Transition economy to a market economy . According to the International Monetary Fund , the nominal GDP of Montenegro was $ 5.424 ; billion in 2019 . The Purchasing power parity for 2019 was $ 12.516 ; billion , or $ 20,083 per capita . According to Eurostat data , the Montenegrin GDP per capita stood at 48 % of the EU average in 2018 . The Central Bank of Montenegro is not part of the euro system but the country is `` euroisation '' , using Montenegro and the euro as its currency .
GDP grew at 10.7 % in 2007 and 7.5 % in 2008 . The country entered a recession in 2008 as a part of the late-2000s recession , with GDP contracting by 4 % . However , Montenegro remained a target for foreign direct investment , the only country in the Balkans to increase its amount of direct foreign investment . The country exited the recession in mid-2010 , with GDP growth at around 0.5 % . However , the significant dependence of the Montenegrin economy on foreign direct investment leaves it susceptible to external shocks and a high export/import trade deficit .
In 2007 , the service sector made up 72.4 % of GDP , with industry and agriculture making up the rest at 17.6 % and 10 % , respectively . There are 50,000 farming households in Montenegro that rely on agriculture to fill the family budget .
=== Infrastructure ===
The Montenegrin road infrastructure is not yet at Western European standards . Despite an extensive road network , no roads are built to full motorway standards . Construction of new motorways is considered a national priority , as they are important for uniform regional economic development and the development of Montenegro as an attractive tourist destination .
Current European routes that pass through Montenegro are European route E65 and European route E80 .
The backbone of the Montenegrin rail network is the BelgradeBar railway , which provides international connection towards Serbia . There is a domestic branch line , the Niki-Podgorica railway , which was operated as a freight-only line for decades , and is now also open for passenger traffic after the reconstruction and electrification works in 2012 . The other branch line from Podgorica towards the Albanian border , the PodgoricaShkodr railway , is not in use .
Montenegro has two international airports , Podgorica Airport and Tivat Airport . The two airports served 1.1 ; million passengers in 2008.
The Port of Bar is Montenegro 's main seaport . Initially built in 1906 , the port was almost completely destroyed during World War II , with reconstruction beginning in 1950 . Today , it is equipped to handle over 5 million tons of cargo annually , though the breakup of the former Yugoslavia and the size of the Montenegrin industrial sector has resulted in the port operating at a loss and well below capacity for several years . The reconstruction of the Belgrade-Bar railway and the proposed Belgrade-Bar motorway are expected to bring the port back up to capacity .
=== Tourism ===
Montenegro has both a picturesque coast and a mountainous northern region . The country was a well-known tourist spot in the 1980s . Yet , the Yugoslav wars that were fought in neighbouring countries during the 1990s crippled the tourist industry and damaged the image of Montenegro for years .
With a total of 1.6 ; million visitors , Montenegro is the 36th most visited country ( out of 47 countries ) in Europe . The Montenegrin Adriatic coast is long , with of beaches and many well-preserved ancient old towns . National Geographic Traveler ( edited once a decade ) ranks Montenegro among the `` 50 Places of a Lifetime '' , and the Montenegrin seaside Sveti Stefan was used as the cover for the magazine . The coast region of Montenegro is considered one of the great new `` discoveries '' among world tourists . In January 2010 , The New York Times ranked the Ulcinj South Coast region of Montenegro , including Velika Plaza , Ada Bojana , and the Hotel Mediteran of Ulcinj , among the `` Top 31 Places to Go in 2010 '' as part of a worldwide ranking of tourism destinations .
Montenegro was also listed by Yahoo Travel among the `` 10 Top Hot Spots of 2009 '' to visit , describing it as being `` [ c ] urrently ranked as the second fastest growing tourism market in the world ( falling just behind China ) '' . It is listed every year by prestigious tourism guides like Lonely Planet as a top tourist destination along with Greece , Spain and other popular locations .
It was not until the 2000s that the tourism industry began to recover , and the country has since experienced a high rate of growth in the number of visits and overnight stays .
== Demographics ==
=== Ethnic structure ===
According to the 2003 census , Montenegro has 620,145 citizens . If the methodology used up to 1991 had been adopted in the 2003 census , Montenegro would officially have recorded 673,094 citizens . The results of the 2011 census show that Montenegro had 620,029 citizens .
Montenegro is a Multinational state in which no ethnic group forms a majority . Major ethnic groups include Montenegrins ( ethnic group ) ( /Crnogorci ) and Serbs ( /Srbi ) ; others are Bosniaks ( Bonjaci ) , Albanians ( Albanci ;  Shqiptart ) and Croats ( Hrvati ) . The number of `` Montenegrins '' and `` Serbs '' fluctuates widely from census to census due to changes in how people perceive , experience , or choose to express , their identity and ethnic affiliation .

Angola ( ; ) , officially the Republic of Angola ( Repblica de Angola ) , is a country in the west coast of Southern Africa . It is the second largest lusophone ( List of territorial entities where Portuguese is an official language Portuguese-speaking ) country in both total area and List of countries and dependencies by population ( behind Brazil ) , and it is the List of African countries by area seventh-largest country in Africa , bordered by Namibia to the south , the Democratic Republic of the Congo to the north , Zambia to the east , and the Atlantic Ocean to the west . Angola has an Enclave and exclave province , the province of Cabinda Province that borders the Republic of the Congo and the Democratic Republic of the Congo . The capital and largest city is Luanda .
Angola has been inhabited since the Paleolithic . Its formation as a nation state originates from European exploration of Africa , which initially began with coastal settlements and trading posts founded in the 16th century . In the 19th century , European settlers gradually began to establish themselves in the interior . The Portuguese Angola that became Angola did not have its present borders until the early 20th century , owing to resistance by native groups such as the Cuamato , the Oukwanyama and the Mbunda people .
After a protracted Angolan War of Independence anti-colonial struggle , Angola achieved independence in 1975 as a MarxismLeninism MarxistLeninist People 's Republic of Angola one-party republic . The country descended into a devastating Angolan Civil War the same year , between the ruling MPLA People 's Movement for the Liberation of Angola ( MPLA ) , backed by the Soviet Union and Cuba , and the insurgent anti-communist UNITA ( UNITA ) , supported by the United States and South Africa . Following the end of the war in 2002 , Angola emerged as a relatively stable Unitary state , Presidential system Republic .
Angola has vast Mineral resource estimation and Oil reserves , and its economy is among the fastest-growing in the world , especially since the end of the civil war . However , economic growth is highly uneven , with most of the nation 's Distribution of wealth # Wealth concentration in a disproportionately small sector of the population . The standard of living remains low for most Angolans ; life expectancy is among the lowest in the world , while infant mortality is among the highest .
Angola is a member of the United Nations , OPEC , African Union , the Community of Portuguese Language Countries , and the Southern African Development Community . Its population of 25.8 million is multicultural and multiethnic . Angolan culture reflects centuries of Portuguese rule , namely the predominance of the Portuguese language and of the Catholic Church , intermingled with a variety of indigenous customs and traditions .
==Etymology==
The name Angola comes from the Portuguese language colonial name Portuguese Angola ( 'Kingdom of Angola ' ) , which appeared as early as Paulo Dias de Novais 's 1571 charter . The Toponymy was derived by the Portuguese from the title List of Ngolas of Ndongo held by the kings of Kingdom of Ndongo . Ndongo in the [ between the Cuanza River Kwanza ] and [ [ Lucala Rivers , was nominally a possession of the Kingdom of Kongo , but was seeking greater independence in the 16th century .
==History==
===Early migrations and political units===
Modern Angola was populated predominantly by nomadic Khoi and San people prior to the first Bantu migrations . The Khoi and San peoples were neither Pastoralisms nor cultivators , but rather [ name=Henderson They were displaced by Bantu peoples ] arriving from the north in the first millennium BC , most of whom likely originated in what is today northwestern [ [ Nigeria and southern Niger . Bantu speakers introduced the cultivation of bananas and taro , as well as large cattle herds , to Angola 's central highlands and the Luanda plain .
A number of political entities were established ; the best-known of these was the Kingdom of the Kongo , based in Angola , which extended northward to what is now the Democratic Republic of the Congo , the Republic of the Congo and Gabon . It established trade routes with other city-states and civilisations up and down the coast of southwestern and western Africa and even with Great Zimbabwe and the Mutapa Empire , although it engaged in little or no transoceanic trade . To its south lay the Kingdom of Ndongo , from which the area of the later Portuguese colony was sometimes known as Dongo .
===Portuguese colonization===
Kingdom of Portugal Age of Discovery Diogo Co reached the area in 1484 . The previous year , the Portuguese had established relations with the Kingdom of Kongo , which stretched at the time from modern Gabon in the north to the Kwanza River in the south . The Portuguese established their primary early trading post at Soyo , which is now the northernmost city in Angola apart from the Cabinda Province enclave and exclave . Paulo Dias de Novais founded So Paulo de Loanda ( Luanda ) in 1575 with a hundred families of settlers and four hundred soldiers . Benguela was fortified in 1587 and became a township in 1617.
The Portuguese established several other settlements , forts and trading posts along the Angolan coast , principally trading in Slavery in Angola for plantations in the American South . Local slave dealers provided a large number of slaves for the Portuguese Empire , usually in exchange for manufactured goods from Europe .
This part of the Atlantic slave trade continued until after Empire of Brazil Brazil 's independence of Brazil in the 1820s .
Despite Portugal 's territorial claims in Angola , its control over much of the country 's vast interior was minimal . In the 16th century Portugal gained control of the coast through a series of treaties and wars . Life for European colonists was difficult and progress slow . John Iliffe ( historian ) notes that `` Portuguese records of Angola from the 16th century show that a great famine occurred on average every seventy years ; accompanied by epidemic disease , it might kill one-third or one-half of the population , destroying the demographic growth of a generation and forcing colonists back into the river valleys '' .
During the Portuguese Restoration War , the Dutch West India Company Dutch Loango-Angola the principal settlement of Luanda in 1641 , using alliances with local peoples to carry out attacks against Portuguese holdings elsewhere . A fleet under Salvador de S retook Luanda in 1648 ; reconquest of the rest of the territory was completed by 1650 . New treaties with the Kingdom of Kongo were signed in 1649 ; others with Nzinga of Ndongo and Matamba 's Kingdom of Matamba and Ndongo followed in 1656 . The conquest of Pungo Andongo in 1671 was the last major Portuguese expansion from Luanda , as attempts to invade Kongo in 1670 and Matamba in 1681 failed . Colonial outposts also expanded inward from Benguela , but until the late 19th century the inroads from Luanda and Benguela were very limited . Hamstrung by a series of political upheavals in the early 1800s , Portugal was slow to mount a large scale annexation of Angolan territory .
The slave trade was abolished in Angola in 1836 , and in 1854 the colonial government freed all its existing slaves . Four years later , a more progressive administration appointed by Lisbon abolished slavery altogether . However , these decrees remained largely unenforceable , and the Portuguese depended on assistance from the British Royal Navy to enforce their ban on the slave trade . This coincided with a series of renewed military expeditions into the bush .
By the mid-nineteenth century Portugal had established its dominion as far east as the Congo River and as far south as Momedes . Until the late 1880s , Lisbon entertained proposals to link Angola with its colony in Mozambique but was blocked by British and Belgian opposition . In this period , the Portuguese came up against different forms of armed resistance from various peoples in Angola .
The Berlin Conference in 18841885 set the colony 's borders , delineating the boundaries of Portuguese claims in Angola , although many details were unresolved until the 1920s . Trade between Portugal and its African territories rapidly increased as a result of protective tariffs , leading to increased development , and a wave of new Portuguese immigrants .
===Angolan independence===
Under colonial law , black Angolans were forbidden from forming political parties or labour unions . The first nationalist movements did not take root until after World War II , spearheaded by a largely Westernised , Portuguese-speaking urban class which included many mestios . During the early 1960s they were joined by other associations stemming from ad hoc labour activism in the rural workforce . Portugal 's refusal to address increasing Angolan demands for self-determination provoked an armed conflict which erupted in 1961 with the Baixa de Cassanje revolt and gradually evolved into a protracted Angolan War of Independence that persisted for the next twelve years . Throughout the conflict , three militant nationalist movements with their own partisan guerrilla wings emerged from the fighting between the Portuguese government and local forces , supported to varying degrees by the Portuguese Communist Party .
The FNLA ( FNLA ) recruited from Bakongo refugees in Zaire . Benefiting from particularly favourable political circumstances in Kinshasha , and especially from a common border with Zaire , Angolan political exiles were able to build up a power base among a large expatriate community from related families , clans , and traditions . People on both sides of the border spoke mutually intelligible dialects and enjoyed shared ties to the historical Kingdom of Kongo . Though as foreigners skilled Angolans could not take advantage of Mobutu Sese Seko 's state employment programme , some found work as middlemen for the absentee owners of various lucrative private ventures . The migrants eventually formed the FNLA with the intention of making a bid for political power upon their envisaged return to Angola .
A largely Ovimbundu guerrilla initiative against the Portuguese in central Angola from 1966 was spearheaded by Jonas Savimbi and the UNITA ( UNITA ) . It remained handicapped by its geographic remoteness from friendly borders , the ethnic fragmentation of the Ovimbundu , and the isolation of peasants on European plantations where they had little opportunity to mobilise .
During the late 1950s , the rise of the MarxistLeninist MPLA ( MPLA ) in the east and Dembos hills north of Luanda came to hold special significance . Formed as a coalition resistance movement by the Angolan Communist Party , the organisation 's leadership remained predominantly Ambundu and courted public sector workers in Luanda . Although both the MPLA and its rivals accepted material assistance from the Soviet Union or the People 's Republic of China , the former harboured strong anti-imperialist views and was openly critical of the United States and its support for Portugal . This allowed it to win important ground on the diplomatic front , soliciting support from nonaligned governments in Morocco , Ghana , Guinea , Mali , and the United Arab Republic .
The MPLA attempted to move its headquarters from Conakry to Lopoldville in October 1961 , renewing efforts to create a common front with the FNLA , then known as the Union of Angolan Peoples ( UPA ) and its leader Holden Roberto . Roberto turned down the offer . When the MPLA first attempted to insert its own insurgents into Angola , the cadres were ambushed and annihilated by UPA partisans on Roberto 's orderssetting a precedent for the bitter factional strife which would later ignite the Angolan Civil War .
===Angolan Civil war===
Throughout the war of independence , the three rival nationalist movements were severely hampered by political and military factionalism , as well as their inability to unite guerrilla efforts against the Portuguese . Between 1961 and 1975 the MPLA , UNITA , and the FNLA competed for influence in the Angolan population and the international community . The Soviet Union and Cuba became especially sympathetic towards the MPLA and supplied that party with arms , ammunition , funding , and training . They also backed UNITA militants until it became clear that the latter was at irreconcilable odds with the MPLA .
The collapse of Portugal 's Estado Novo ( Portugal ) government following the 1974 Carnation Revolution suspended all Portuguese military activity in Africa and the brokering of a ceasefire pending negotiations for Angolan independence . Encouraged by the Organisation of African Unity , Holden Roberto , Jonas Savimbi , and MPLA chairman Agostinho Neto met in Mombasa in early January 1975 and agreed to form a coalition government . This was ratified by the Alvor Agreement later that month , which called for general elections and set the country 's independence date for 11 November 1975 . All three factions , however , followed up on the ceasefire by taking advantage of the gradual Portuguese withdrawal to seize various strategic positions , acquire more arms , and enlarge their militant forces . The rapid influx of weapons from numerous external sources , especially the Soviet Union and the United States , as well as the escalation of tensions between the nationalist parties , fueled a new outbreak of hostilities . With tacit American and Zairean support the FNLA began massing large numbers of troops in northern Angola in an attempt to gain military superiority . Meanwhile , the MPLA began securing control of Luanda , a traditional Ambundu stronghold . Sporadic violence broke out in Luanda over the next few months after the FNLA attacked MPLA forces in March 1975 . The fighting intensified with street clashes in April and May , and UNITA became involved after over two hundred of its members were massacred by an MPLA contingent that June . An upswing in Soviet arms shipments to the MPLA influenced a decision by the Central Intelligence Agency to likewise provide substantial covert aid to the FNLA and UNITA .
In August 1975 , the MPLA requested direct assistance from the Soviet Union in the form of ground troops . The Soviets declined , offering to send advisers but no troops ; however , Cuba was more forthcoming and in late September dispatched nearly five hundred combat personnel to Angola , along with sophisticated weaponry and supplies . By independence there were over a thousand Cuban soldiers in the country . They were kept supplied by a massive CubaAngola airbridge carried out with Soviet aircraft . The persistent buildup of Cuban and Soviet military aid allowed the MPLA to drive its opponents from Luanda and blunt an abortive intervention by Zairean and South African troops , which had deployed in a belated attempt to assist the FNLA and UNITA . The FNLA was largely annihilated , although UNITA managed to withdraw its civil officials and militia from Luanda and seek sanctuary in the southern provinces . From there , Savimbi continued to mount a determined insurgent campaign against the MPLA .
Between 1975 and 1991 , the MPLA implemented an economic and political system based on the principles of scientific socialism , incorporating Planned economy and a MarxistLeninist one-party state . It embarked on an ambitious programme of Nationalization , and the domestic private sector was essentially abolished . Privately owned enterprises were nationalised and incorporated into a single umbrella of state-owned enterprises known as Unidades Economicas Estatais ( UEE ) . Under the MPLA , Angola experienced a significant degree of modern industrialisation . However , corruption and graft also increased and public resources were either allocated inefficiently or simply embezzled by officials for personal enrichment . The ruling party survived an attempted coup d'tat by the Maoism-oriented Communist Organization of Angola ( OCA ) in 1977 , which was suppressed after a series of bloody political purges left thousands of OCA supporters dead .
The MPLA abandoned its former Marxist ideology at its third party congress in 1990 , and declared social democracy to be its new platform . Angola subsequently became a member of the International Monetary Fund ; restrictions on the market economy were also reduced in an attempt to draw foreign investment . By May 1991 it reached a peace agreement with UNITA , the Bicesse Accords , which scheduled Angolan general election , 1992 for September 1992 . When the MPLA secured a major electoral victory , UNITA objected to the results of both the presidential and legislative vote count and returned to war . Following the election , the Halloween massacre ( Angola ) occurred from 30 October to 1 November , where MPLA forces killed thousands of UNITA supporters .
===21st century===
On 22 March 2002 , Jonas Savimbi was killed in action against government troops . UNITA and the MPLA reached a cease-fire shortly afterwards . UNITA gave up its armed wing and assumed the role of a major opposition party . Although the political situation of the country began to stabilise , regular democratic processes did not prevail until the elections in Angola in 2008 and 2012 and the adoption of a new Constitution of Angola in 2010 , all of which strengthened the prevailing dominant-party system .
Angola has a serious humanitarian crisis ; the result of the prolonged war , of the abundance of minefields , of the continued political ( and to a much lesser degree ) military activities in favour of the independence of the enclave and exclave of Cabinda ( province ) ( carried out in the context of the protracted Cabinda War by the Front for the Liberation of the Enclave of Cabinda ) , but most of all , by the depredation of the country 's rich mineral resources by the rgime . While most of the internally displaced have now settled around the capital , in the so-called wikt : musseques , the general situation for Angolans remains desperate .
Drought in 2016 caused the worst food crisis in Southern Africa in 25 years . Drought affected 1.4 million people across seven of Angola 's 18 provinces . Food prices rose and acute malnutrition rates doubled , with more than 95,000 children affected .
Jos Eduardo dos Santos stepped down as President of Angola after 38 years in 2017 , being peacefully succeeded by Joo Loureno , Santos ' chosen successor .
==Geography==
At , Angola is the world 's twenty-third largest country - comparable in size to Mali , or twice the size of France or of Texas . It lies mostly between latitudes 4th parallel south 4 and 18th parallel south 18S , and longitudes 12th meridian east 12 and 24th meridian east 24E .
Angola borders Namibia to the south , Zambia to the east , the Democratic Republic of the Congo to the north-east and the South Atlantic Ocean to the west .
The coastal enclave and exclave of Cabinda ( province ) in the north has borders with the Republic of the Congo to the north and with the Democratic Republic of the Congo to the south .
Angola 's capital , Luanda , lies on the Atlantic coast in the northwest of the country .
Angola had a 2018 Forest Landscape Integrity Index mean score of 8.35/10 , ranking it 23rd globally out of 172 countries .
===Climate===
Angola , although located in a tropical zone , has a climate uncharacteristic of this zone , due to the confluence of three factors :
* the cold Benguela Current flowing along the southern part of the coast
* the relief in the interior
* the influence of the Namib Desert in the southwest
Angola 's climate features two seasons :
* rainfall from November to April
* drought , known as Cacimbo , from May to October , drier , as the name implies , and with lower temperatures
While the coastline has high rainfall rates , decreasing from north to south and from to , with average annual temperatures above , one can divide the interior zone into three areas :
* North , with high rainfall and high temperatures
* Central Plateau , with a dry season and average temperatures of the order of 19 ; C
* South , with very high thermal amplitudes due to the proximity of the Kalahari Desert and the influence of masses of tropical air
===Administrative divisions===
, Angola is divided into Provinces of Angola ( provncias ) and Municipalities of Angola . The municipalities are further divided into 559 communes ( townships ) . The provinces are :
===Exclave of Cabinda===
With an area of approximately , the Northern Angolan province of Cabinda is unusual in being separated from the rest of the country by a strip , some wide , of the Democratic Republic of Congo along the lower Congo River . Cabinda borders the Congo Republic to the north and north-northeast and the DRC to the east and south . The town of Cabinda is the chief population centre .
According to a 1995 census , Cabinda had an estimated population of 600,000 , approximately 400,000 of whom live in neighbouring countries . Population estimates are , however , highly unreliable . Consisting largely of tropical forest , Cabinda produces hardwoods , coffee , cocoa , crude rubber and palm oil .
The product for which it is best known , however , is its oil , which has given it the nickname , `` the Kuwait of Africa '' . Cabinda 's petroleum production from its considerable offshore reserves now accounts for more than half of Angola 's output . Most of the oil along its coast was discovered under Portuguese Angola by the Cabinda Gulf Oil Company ( CABGOC ) from 1968 onwards .
Ever since Portugal handed over sovereignty of its former overseas province of Angola to the local independence groups ( MPLA , UNITA and FNLA ) , the territory of Cabinda has been a focus of separatist guerrilla actions opposing the Government of Angola ( which has employed its armed forces , the FAAForas Armadas Angolanas ) and Cabindan separatists . The Front for the Liberation of the Enclave of Cabinda-Foras Armadas de Cabinda ( FLEC-FAC ) announced a virtual Federal Republic of Cabinda under the Presidency of N'Zita Henriques Tiago . One of the characteristics of the Cabindan independence movement is its constant fragmentation , into smaller and smaller factions .
== Government and politics ==
The Angolan government is composed of three branches of government : executive , legislative and judicial . The executive branch of the government is composed of the President , the Vice-Presidents and the Council of Ministers .
The legislative branch comprises a 220-seat Unicameralism legislature , the National Assembly of Angola , elected from both provincial and nationwide constituencies . For decades , political power has been concentrated in the presidency .
After 38 years of rule , in 2017 President dos Santos stepped down from MPLA leadership . The leader of the winning party at the parliamentary elections in August 2017 would become the next president of Angola . The MPLA selected the former Defense Minister Joo Loureno as Santos ' chosen successor .
In what has been described as a political purge to cement his power and reduce the influence of the Dos Santos family , Loureno subsequently sacked the chief of the national police , Ambrsio de Lemos , and the head of the intelligence service , Apolinrio Jos Pereira . Both are considered allies of former president Dos Santos . He also removed Isabel dos Santos , daughter of the former president , as head of the country 's state oil company Sonangol .
===Constitution===
The Constitution of Angola establishes the broad outlines of government structure and delineates the rights and duties of citizens . The legal system is based on Portuguese law and customary law but is weak and fragmented , and courts operate in only 12 of more than 140 municipalities . A Supreme Court serves as the appellate tribunal ; a Constitutional Court does not hold the powers of judicial review . Governors of the 18 provinces are appointed by the president . After the end of the civil war the regime came under pressure from within as well as from the international community to become more democratic and less authoritarian . Its reaction was to implement a number of changes without substantially changing its character .
The Constitution of Angola , adopted in 2010 , did away with presidential elections , introducing a system in which the president and the vice-president of the political party that wins the parliamentary elections automatically become president and vice-president . Directly or indirectly , the president controls all other organs of the state , so there is de facto no separation of powers . In the classifications used in constitutional law , this government falls under the category of authoritarian regime .
===Armed forces===
The Angolan Armed Forces ( AAF ) are headed by a Chief of Staff who reports to the Minister of Defence . There are three divisionsthe Army ( Exrcito ) , Navy ( Marinha de Guerra , MGA ) and National Air Force of Angola ( Fora Area Nacional , FAN ) . Total manpower is 107,000 ; plus paramilitary forces of 10,000 ( 2015 est. ) .
Its equipment includes Russian-manufactured fighters , bombers and transport planes . There are also Brazilian-made EMB-312 Tucanos for training , Czech-made L-39s for training and bombing , and a variety of western-made aircraft such as the C-212\Aviocar , Sud Aviation Alouette III , etc . A small number of AAF personnel are stationed in the Democratic Republic of the Congo ( Kinshasa ) and the Republic of the Congo ( Brazzaville ) .
===Police===
The National Police departments are Public Order , Criminal Investigation , Traffic and Transport , Investigation and Inspection of Economic Activities , Taxation and Frontier Supervision , Riot Police and the Rapid Intervention Police . The National Police are in the process of standing up an air wing , to provide helicopter support for operations . The National Police are developing their criminal investigation and forensic capabilities . The force has an estimated 6,000 patrol officers , 2,500 taxation and frontier supervision officers , 182 criminal investigators and 100 financial crimes detectives and around 90 economic activity inspectors .
The National Police have implemented a modernisation and development plan to increase the capabilities and efficiency of the total force . In addition to administrative reorganisation , modernisation projects include procurement of new vehicles , aircraft and equipment , construction of new police stations and forensic laboratories , restructured training programmes and the replacement of AKM rifles with 9 ; mm Uzis for officers in urban areas .
===Justice===
A Supreme Court serves as a court of appeal . The Constitutional Court is the supreme body of the constitutional jurisdiction , established with the approval of Law no . 2/08 , of 17 June  Organic Law of the Constitutional Court and Law n. 3/08 , of 17 June  Organic Law of the Constitutional Process . The legal system is based on Portuguese and customary laws , but it is weak and fragmented . There are only 12 courts in more than 140 counties in the country . Its first task was the validation of the candidacies of the political parties to the legislative elections of 5 September 2008 . Thus , on 25 June 2008 , the Constitutional Court was institutionalized and its Judicial Counselors assumed the position before the President of the Republic . Currently , seven advisory judges are present , four men and three women .
In 2014 , a new penal code took effect in Angola . The classification of money-laundering as a crime is one of the novelties in the new legislation .
===Foreign relations===
Angola is a founding member state of the Community of Portuguese Language Countries ( CPLP ) , also known as the Lusophone Commonwealth , an international organization and political association of Lusophone nations across four continents , where Portuguese language is an official language .
On 16 October 2014 , Angola was elected for the second time a non-permanent member of the United Nations Security Council , with 190 favorable votes out of a total of 193 . The term of office began on 1 January 2015 and expired on 31 December 2016.
Since January 2014 , the Republic of Angola has been chairing the International Conference for the Great Lakes Region ( CIRGL ) . [ 80 ] In 2015 , CIRGL Executive Secretary Ntumba Luaba said that Angola is the example to be followed by the members of the organization , due to the significant progress made during the 12 years of peace , namely in terms of socio-economic stability and political- military .
===Human rights===
Angola is classified as 'not free ' by Freedom House in the Freedom in the World 2014 report . The report noted that the Angolan legislative election , 2012 , in which the ruling Popular Movement for the Liberation of Angola won more than 70 % of the vote , suffered from serious flaws , including outdated and inaccurate voter rolls . Voter turnout dropped from 80 % in 2008 to 60 % .
A 2012 report by the United States State Department U.S. Department of State said , `` The three most important [ rights ] abuses [ in 2012 ] were official corruption and impunity ; limits on the freedoms of assembly , association , speech , and press ; and cruel and excessive punishment , including reported cases of torture and beatings as well as unlawful killings by police and other security personnel . ''
Angola ranked forty-two of forty-eight sub-Saharan African states on the 2007 Index of African Governance list and scored poorly on the 2013 Ibrahim Index of African Governance . It was ranked 39 out of 52 sub-Saharan African countries , scoring particularly badly in the areas of participation and human rights , sustainable economic opportunity and human development . The Ibrahim Index uses a number of variables to compile its list which reflects the state of governance in Africa .
In 2019 , Homosexuality acts were decriminalized in Angola , and the government also prohibited discrimination based on sexual orientation . The vote was overwhelming : 155 for , 1 against , 7 abstaining .
==Economy==
Angola has diamonds , oil , gold , copper and a rich wildlife ( dramatically impoverished during the civil war ) , forest and fossil fuels . Since independence , oil and diamonds have been the most important economic resource . Smallholding and plantation agriculture dramatically dropped in the Angolan Civil War , but began to recover after 2002.
Angola 's economy has in recent years moved on from the disarray caused by a quarter-century of Angolan civil war to become the fastest-growing economy in Africa and one of the fastest-growing in the world , with an average GDP growth of 20 % between 2005 and 2007 . In the period 200110 , Angola had the world 's highest annual average GDP growth , at 11.1 % .
In 2004 , the Exim Bank of China approved a $ 2 ; billion line of credit to Angola , to be used for rebuilding Angola 's infrastructure , and to limit the influence of the International Monetary Fund there .
China is Angola 's biggest trade partner and export destination as well as the fourth-largest source of imports . Bilateral trade reached $ 27.67 ; billion in 2011 , up 11.5 % year-on-year . China 's imports , mainly crude oil and diamonds , increased 9.1 % to $ 24.89 ; billion while China 's exports to Angola , including mechanical and electrical products , machinery parts and construction materials , surged 38.8 % . The oil Overproduction led to a local price for unleaded gasoline of Pound sterling 0.37 a gallon .
The Angolan economy grew 18 % in 2005 , 26 % in 2006 and 17.6 % in 2007 . Due to the global recession the economy contracted an estimated 0.3 % in 2009 . The security brought about by the 2002 peace settlement has allowed the resettlement of 4 ; million displaced persons and a resulting large-scale increases in agriculture production . Angola 's economy is expected to grow by 3.9 percent in 2014 said the International Monetary Fund ( IMF ) , robust growth in the non-oil economy , mainly driven by a very good performance in the agricultural sector , is expected to offset a temporary drop in oil production .
Angola 's financial system is maintained by the National Bank of Angola and managed by governor : no : Jose de Lima Massano . According to a study on the banking sector , carried out by Deloitte , the monetary policy led by Banco Nacional de Angola ( BNA ) , the Angolan national bank , allowed a decrease in the inflation rate put at 7.96 % in December 2013 , which contributed to the sector 's growth trend . Estimates released by Angola 's central bank , said country 's economy should grow at an annual average rate of 5 percent over the next four years , boosted by the increasing participation of the private sector .
Although the country 's economy has grown significantly since Angola achieved political stability in 2002 , mainly due to fast-rising earnings in the oil sector , Angola faces huge social and economic problems . These are in part a result of almost continual armed conflict from 1961 on , although the highest level of destruction and socio-economic damage took place after the 1975 independence , during the long years of Angolan Civil War . However , high poverty rates and blatant social inequality chiefly stem from persistent authoritarianism , `` neo-patrimonial '' practices at all levels of the political , administrative , military and economic structures , and of Corruption in Angola . The main beneficiaries are political , administrative , economic and military power holders , who have accumulated ( and continue to accumulate ) enormous wealth .
`` Secondary beneficiaries '' are the middle strata which are about to become social classes . However , almost half the population has to be considered poor , with dramatic differences between the countryside and the cities ( where by now slightly more than 50 % of the people live ) .
A study carried out in 2008 by the Angolan Instituto Nacional de Estatstica found that in rural areas roughly 58 % must be classified as `` poor '' according to UN norms , but in the urban areas only 19 % , and an overall rate of 37 % . In cities , a majority of families , well beyond those officially classified as poor , must adopt a variety of survival strategies . In urban areas social inequality is most evident and it is extreme in Luanda . In the Human Development Index Angola constantly ranks in the bottom group .
In January 2020 , a leak of government documents known as the Luanda Leaks showed that U.S. consulting companies such as Boston Consulting Group , McKinsey & Company , and PricewaterhouseCoopers had helped members of the family of former President Jos Eduardo dos Santos ( especially his daughter Isabel dos Santos ) corruptly run Sonangol for their own personal profit , helping them use the company 's revenues to fund vanity projects in France and Switzerland .
The enormous differences between the regions pose a serious structural problem for the Angolan economy , illustrated by the fact that about one third of economic activities are concentrated in Luanda and neighbouring Bengo province , while several areas of the interior suffer economic stagnation and even regression .
One of the economic consequences of the social and regional disparities is a sharp increase in Angolan private investments abroad . The small fringe of Angolan society where most of the asset accumulation takes place seeks to spread its assets , for reasons of security and profit . For the time being , the biggest share of these investments is concentrated in Portugal where the Angolans in Portugal ( including the family of the state president ) in banks as well as in the domains of energy , Telecommunications in Angola , and mass media has become notable , as has the acquisition of vineyards and orchards as well as of touristic enterprises .
Angola has upgraded critical infrastructure , an investment made possible by funds from the nation 's development of oil resources . According to a report , just slightly more than ten years after the end of the Angolan Civil War Angola 's standard of living has overall greatly improved . Life expectancy , which was just 46 years in 2002 , reached 51 in 2011 . Mortality rates for children fell from 25 percent in 2001 to 19 percent in 2010 and the number of students enrolled in primary school has tripled since 2001 . However , at the same time the social and economic inequality that has characterised the country for so long has not diminished , but on the contrary deepened in all respects .
With a stock of assets corresponding to 70 ; billion Kz ( US $ 6.8 ; billion ) , Angola is now the third-largest financial market in sub-Saharan Africa , surpassed only by Nigeria and South Africa . According to the Angolan Minister of Economy , Abrao Gourgel , the financial market of the country grew modestly from 2002 and now lies in third place at the level of sub-Saharan Africa .
On 19 December 2014 , the Capital Market in Angola started . Angola Stock Exchange and Derivatives ( Angola Stock Exchange and Derivatives , in English ) received the secondary public debt market , and it is expected to start the corporate debt market by 2015 , but the stock market should be a reality only in 2016.
===Natural resources===
The Economist reported in 2008 that diamonds and oil make up 60 % of Angola 's economy , almost all of the country 's revenue and all of its dominant exports . Growth is almost entirely driven by rising Extraction of petroleum which surpassed in late 2005 and was expected to grow to by 2007 . Control of the Petroleum industry is consolidated in Sonangol Group , a conglomerate owned by the Angolan government . In December 2006 , Angola was admitted as a member of OPEC .
According to the Heritage Foundation , a conservative American think tank , oil production from Angola has increased so significantly that Angola now is China 's biggest supplier of oil . `` China has extended three multibillion dollar lines of credit to the Angolan government ; two loans of $ 2 billion from China Exim Bank , one in 2004 , the second in 2007 , as well as one loan in 2005 of $ 2.9 billion from China International Fund Ltd. ''
Growing oil revenues also created opportunities for Corruption in Angola : according to a recent Human Rights Watch report , 32 ; billion US dollars disappeared from government accounts in 20072010 . Furthermore , Sonangol , the state-run oil company , controls 51 % of Cabinda 's oil . Due to this market control the company ends up determining the profit received by the government and the taxes it pays . The council of foreign affairs states that the World Bank mentioned that Sonangol `` is a taxpayer , it carries out quasi-fiscal activities , it invests public funds , and , as concessionaire , it is a sector regulator . This multifarious work programme creates conflicts of interest and characterises a complex relationship between Sonangol and the government that weakens the formal budgetary process and creates uncertainty as regards the actual fiscal stance of the state . ''
In 2002 Angola demanded compensation for oil spills allegedly caused by Chevron Corporation , the first time it had fined a multinational corporation operating in its waters .
Operations in its List of diamond mines include partnerships between state-run Endiama and mining companies such as ALROSA which operate in Angola .
Access to biocapacity in Angola is higher than world average . In 2016 , Angola had 1.9 global hectares of biocapacity per person within its territory , slightly more than world average of 1.6 global hectares per person . In 2016 Angola used 1.01 global hectares of biocapacity per person - their ecological footprint of consumption . This means they use about half as much biocapacity as Angola contains . As a result , Angola is running a biocapacity reserve .
===Agriculture===
Agriculture and forestry is an area of potential opportunity for the country . The African Economic Outlook organization states that `` Angola requires 4.5 million tonnes a year of grain but grows only about 55 % of the maize it needs , 20 % of the rice and just 5 % of its required wheat '' .
In addition , the World Bank estimates that `` less than 3 percent of Angola 's abundant fertile land is cultivated and the economic potential of the forestry sector remains largely unexploited '' .
Before independence in 1975 , Angola ( Portugal ) was a breadbasket of southern Africa and a major exporter of bananas , coffee and sisal , but Angolan Civil War ( 19752002 ) destroyed fertile countryside , left it littered with landmines and drove millions into the cities .
The country now depends on expensive food imports , mainly from South Africa and Portugal , while more than 90 % of farming is done at the family and subsistence level . Thousands of Angolan small-scale farmers are trapped in poverty .
=== Transport ===
Transport in Angola consists of :
* Three separate Rail transport in Angola totalling
* of highway of which is paved
* 1,295 navigable inland waterways
* Eight major sea ports
* 243 List of airports in Angola , of which 32 are paved .
Angola centers its port trade in five main ports : Port of Namibe , Port of Lobito , Soyo , Cabinda and Port of Luanda . The port of Luanda is the largest of the five , as well as being one of the busiest on the African continent . Major expansion of this port is also taking place .
Travel on highways outside of towns and cities in Angola ( and in some cases within ) is often not best advised for those without four-by-four vehicles . While a reasonable road infrastructure has existed within Angola , time and the war have taken their toll on the road surfaces , leaving many severely potholed , littered with broken asphalt . In many areas drivers have established alternate tracks to avoid the worst parts of the surface , although careful attention must be paid to the presence or absence of landmine warning markers by the side of the road . The Angolan government has contracted the restoration of many of the country 's roads . The road between Lubango and Namibe , for example , was completed recently with funding from the European Union , and is comparable to many European main routes . Completing the road infrastructure is likely to take some decades , but substantial efforts are already being made .
===Telecommunications===
The telecommunications industry is considered one of the main strategic sectors in Angola .
In October 2014 , the building of an optic fiber underwater cable was announced . This project aims to turn Angola into a continental hub , thus improving Internet connections both nationally and internationally .
On 11 March 2015 , the First Angolan Forum of Telecommunications and Information Technology was held in Luanda under the motto `` The challenges of telecommunications in the current context of Angola '' , to promote debate on topical issues on telecommunications in Angola and worldwide . A study of this sector , presented at the forum , said Angola had the first telecommunications operator in Africa to test LTE  with speeds up to 400 Mbit/s  and mobile penetration of about 75 % ; there are about 3.5 million smartphones in the Angolan market ; There are about of optical fibre installed in the country .
The first Angolan satellite , Angosat 1 AngoSat-1 , was launched into orbit on 26 December 2017 . It was launched from the Baikonur Cosmodrome in Kazakhstan on board a Zenit-3F rocket . The satellite was built by Russia 's RSC Energia , a subsidiary of the state-run space industry player Roscosmos . The satellite payload was supplied by Airbus Defence & Space . Due to an on-board power failure during solar panel deployment , on 27 December , RSC Energia revealed that they lost communications contact with the satellite . Although , subsequent attempts to restore communications with the satellite were successful , the satellite eventually stopped sending data and RSC Energia confirmed that AngoSat-1 was inoperable . The launch of AngoSat-1 was aimed at ensuring telecommunications throughout the country . According to Aristides Safeca , Secretary of State for Telecommunications , the satellite was aimed at providing telecommunications services , TV , internet and e-government and was expected to remain in orbit `` at best '' for 18 years . A replacement satellite named AngoSat-2 is in the works and is expected to be in service by 2020.
=== Technology ===
The management of the top-level domain '.ao ' passed from Portugal to Angola in 2015 , following new legislation . A joint decree of minister of Telecommunications and Information Technologies Jos Carvalho da Rocha and the minister of Science and Technology , Maria Cndida Pereira Teixeira , states that `` under the massification '' of that Angolan domain , `` conditions are created for the transfer of the domain root '.ao ' of Portugal to Angola '' .

Angola has a population of 24,383,301 inhabitants according to the preliminary results of its 2014 census , the first one conducted or carried out since 15 December 1970 . It is composed of Ovimbundu ( language Umbundu ) 37 % , Northern Mbundu people ( language Kimbundu ) 23 % , Bakongo 13 % , and 32 % other ethnic groups ( including the Chokwe people , the Ovambo people , the Ganguela and the Xindonga ) as well as about 2 % mestios ( mixed European and African ) , 1.6 % Chinese and 1 % European . The Ambundu and Ovimbundu ethnic groups combined form a majority of the population , at 62 % . The population is forecast to grow to over 60 million people to 2050 , 2.7 times the 2014 population . However , on 23 March 2016 , official data revealed by Angola 's National Statistic Institute  Instituto Nacional de Estatstica ( INE ) , states that Angola has a population of 25,789,024 inhabitants .
It is estimated that Angola was host to 12,100 refugees and 2,900 asylum seekers by the end of 2007 . 11,400 of those refugees were originally from the Democratic Republic of Congo , who arrived in the 1970s . there were an estimated 400,000 Democratic Republic of the Congo migrant workers , at least 220,000 Portuguese Angolans , and about 259,000 Chinese people in Angola . 1 million Angolans are mixed race ( black and white ) .
Since 2003 , more than 400,000 Democratic Republic of the Congo migrants have been expelled from Angola . Prior to independence in 1975 , Angola had a community of approximately 350,000 Portuguese , but the vast majority left after independence and the ensuing civil war . However , Angola has recovered its Portuguese minority in recent years ; currently , there are about 200,000 registered with the consulates , and increasing due to the debt crisis in Portugal and the relative prosperity in Angola . The Chinese population stands at 258,920 , mostly composed of temporary migrants . Also , there is a small Brazilian community of about 5,000 people .
, the total fertility rate of Angola is 5.54 children born per woman ( 2012 estimates ) , the 11th highest in the world .
=== Languages ===
The languages in Angola are those originally spoken by the different ethnic groups and Portuguese language , introduced during the Portuguese colonial era . The most widely spoken indigenous languages are Umbundu , Kimbundu and Kikongo , in that order . Portuguese is the official language of the country .
Although the exact numbers of those fluent in Portuguese or who speak Portuguese as a first language are unknown , a 2012 study mentions that Portuguese is the first language of 39 % of the population . In 2014 , a census carried out by the Instituto Nacional de Estatstica in Angola mentions that 71.15 % of the nearly 25.8 million inhabitants of Angola ( meaning around 18.3 million people ) use Portuguese as a first or second language .
According to the 2014 census , Portuguese language is spoken by 71.1 % of Angolans , Umbundu language by 23 % , Kikongo language by 8.2 % , Kimbundu by 7.8 % , Chokwe language by 6.5 % , Nyaneka language by 3.4 % , Ngangela language by 3.1 % , Fiote language by 2.4 % , Kwanyama language by 2.3 % , Muhumbi language by 2.1 % , Luvale language by 1 % , and Languages of Angola by 4.1 % .
=== Religion ===
There are about 1,000 religious communities , mostly Christian , in Angola . While reliable statistics are nonexistent , estimates have it that more than half of the population are Catholics , while about a quarter adhere to the Protestant churches introduced during the colonial period : the Congregationalists mainly among the Ovimbundu of the Central Highlands and the coastal region to its west , the Methodists concentrating on the Kimbundu speaking strip from Luanda to Malanje , the Baptists almost exclusively among the Bakongo of the north-west ( now present in Luanda as well ) and dispersed Adventists , Reformed and Lutherans .
In Luanda and region there subsists a nucleus of the `` syncretic '' Tocoists and in the north-west a sprinkling of Kimbanguism can be found , spreading from the Congo/Zare . Since independence , hundreds of Pentecostal and similar communities have sprung up in the cities , where by now about 50 % of the population is living ; several of these communities/churches are of Brazilian origin .
the U.S. Department of State estimates the Muslim population at 80,00090,000 , less than 1 % of the population , while the Islam in Angola puts the figure closer to 500,000 . Muslims consist largely of migrants from West Africa and the Middle East ( especially Lebanon ) , although some are local converts . The Angolan government does not Islam in Angola # Legal status any Muslim organizations and often shuts down mosques or prevents their construction .
In a study assessing nations ' levels of religious regulation and persecution with scores ranging from 0 to 10 where 0 represented low levels of regulation or persecution , Angola was scored 0.8 on Government Regulation of Religion , 4.0 on Social Regulation of Religion , 0 on Government Favoritism of Religion and 0 on Religious Persecution .
Foreign Missionary were very active prior to independence in 1975 , although since the beginning of the anti-colonial fight in 1961 the Portuguese colonial authorities expelled a series of Protestant missionaries and closed mission stations based on the belief that the missionaries were inciting pro-independence sentiments . Missionaries have been able to return to the country since the early 1990s , although security conditions due to the civil war have prevented them until 2002 from restoring many of their former inland mission stations .
The Catholic Church and some major Protestant denominations mostly keep to themselves in contrast to the `` New Churches '' which actively proselytize . Catholics , as well as some major Protestant denominations , provide help for the poor in the form of crop seeds , farm animals , medical care and education .
=== Urbanization ===
=== Health ===
Epidemics of cholera , malaria , rabies and African [ fevers like Marburg virus Marburg hemorrhagic fever ] , are common diseases in several parts of the country . Many regions in this country have high incidence rates of [ [ tuberculosis and high HIV/AIDS in Africa rates . Dengue , filariasis , leishmaniasis and onchocerciasis ( river blindness ) are other diseases carried by insects that also occur in the region . Angola has one of the highest infant mortality rates in the world and one of the world 's lowest life expectancies . A 2007 survey concluded that low and deficient niacin status was common in Angola . Demographic and Health Surveys is currently conducting several surveys in Angola on malaria , domestic violence and more .
In September 2014 , the Angolan Institute for Cancer Control ( IACC ) was created by presidential decree , and it will integrate the National Health Service in Angola . The purpose of this new centre is to ensure health and medical care in oncology , policy implementation , programmes and plans for prevention and specialised treatment .

In 2014 , Angola launched a national campaign of vaccination against measles , extended to every child under ten years old and aiming to go to all 18 provinces in the country . The measure is part of the Strategic Plan for the Elimination of Measles 20142020 created by the Angolan Ministry of Health which includes strengthening routine immunisation , a proper dealing with measles cases , national campaigns , introducing a second dose of vaccination in the national routine vaccination calendar and active epidemiological surveillance for measles . This campaign took place together with the vaccination against polio and vitamin A supplementation .
A 2016 Angola and DR Congo yellow fever outbreak outbreak , the worst in the country in three decades began in December 2015 . By August 2016 , when the outbreak began to subside , nearly 4,000 people were suspected of being infected . As many as 369 may have died . The outbreak began in the capital , Luanda , and spread to at least 16 of the 18 provinces .
=== Education ===
Although by law education in Angola is compulsory and free for eight years , the government reports that a percentage of pupils are not attending due to a lack of school buildings and teachers . Pupils are often responsible for paying additional school-related expenses , including fees for books and supplies .
In 1999 , the gross primary enrollment rate was 74 percent and in 1998 , the most recent year for which data are available , the net primary enrollment rate was 61 percent . Gross and net enrollment ratios are based on the number of pupils formally registered in primary school and therefore do not necessarily reflect actual school attendance . There continue to be significant disparities in enrollment between rural and urban areas . In 1995 , 71.2 percent of children ages 7 to 14 years were attending school . It is reported that higher percentages of boys attend school than girls . During the Angolan Civil War ( 19752002 ) , nearly half of all schools were reportedly looted and destroyed , leading to current problems with overcrowding .
The Ministry of Education recruited 20,000 new teachers in 2005 and continued to implement teacher trainings . Teachers tend to be underpaid , inadequately trained and overworked ( sometimes teaching two or three shifts a day ) . Some teachers may reportedly demand payment or bribes directly from their pupils . Other factors , such as the presence of landmines , lack of resources and identity papers , and poor health prevent children from regularly attending school . Although budgetary allocations for education were increased in 2004 , the education system in Angola continues to be extremely under-funded .
According to estimates by the UNESCO Institute for Statistics , the adult literacy rate in 2011 was 70.4 % . By 2015 , this had increased to 71.1 % . 82.9 % of males and 54.2 % of women are literate as of 2001 . Since independence from Portugal in 1975 , a number of Angolan students continued to be admitted every year at high schools , politechnic institutes and universities in Portugal and Brazil through bilateral agreements ; in general , these students belong to the elites .
In September 2014 , the Angolan Ministry of Education announced an investment of 16 million Euros in the computerisation of over 300 classrooms across the country . The project also includes training teachers at a national level , `` as a way to introduce and use new information technologies in primary schools , thus reflecting an improvement in the quality of teaching '' .
In 2010 , the Angolan government started building the Angolan Media Libraries Network , distributed throughout several provinces in the country to facilitate the people 's access to information and knowledge . Each site has a bibliographic archive , multimedia resources and computers with Internet access , as well as areas for reading , researching and socialising . The plan envisages the establishment of one media library in each Angolan province by 2017 . The project also includes the implementation of several media libraries , in order to provide the several contents available in the fixed media libraries to the most isolated populations in the country . At this time , the mobile media libraries are already operating in the provinces of Luanda , Malanje , Uge , Cabinda and Lunda South . As for REMA , the provinces of Luanda , Benguela , Lubango and Soyo have currently working media libraries .
==Culture==
Angolan culture has been heavily influenced by Portuguese culture , especially in terms of language and religion , and the culture of the indigenous ethnic groups of Angola , predominantly Bantu people .
The diverse ethnic communitiesthe Ovimbundu , Northern Mbundu people , Bakongo , Chokwe people , Mbunda people and other peoplesto varying degrees maintain their own cultural traits , traditions and languages , but in the cities , where slightly more than half of the population now lives , a mixed culture has been emerging since colonial times ; in Luanda , since its foundation in the 16th century .
In this urban culture , the Portuguese heritage has become more and more dominant . African roots are evident in music and dance , and is moulding the way in which Portuguese is spoken . This process is well reflected in contemporary Angolan literature , especially in the works of Angolan literature .
In 2014 , Angola resumed the National Festival of Angolan Culture after a 25-year break . The festival took place in all the provincial capitals and lasted for 20 days , with the theme  Culture as a Factor of Peace and Development .
=== Cinema ===
In 1972 , one of Angola 's first feature films , Sarah Maldoror 's Co-production ( media ) internationally co-produced Sambizanga ( film ) , was released at the Carthage Film Festival to critical acclaim , winning the Tanit d'Or , the festival 's highest prize .
=== Sports ===
Basketball is the most popular sport in Angola . Its Angola national basketball team has won the AfroBasket 11 times and holds the record of most titles . As a top team in Africa , it is a regular competitor at the Basketball at the Summer Olympics and the FIBA World Cup . Angola is home to one of Africa 's first competitive leagues .
In football , Angola hosted the 2010 Africa Cup of Nations . The Angola national football team qualified for the 2006 FIFA World Cup , their first appearance in the World Cup finals . They were eliminated after one defeat and two draws in the group stage . They won three COSAFA Cups and finished runner-up in the 2011 African Nations Championship .
Angola has participated in the World Women 's Handball Championship for several years . The country has also appeared in the Angola at the Olympics for seven years and both regularly competes in and once has hosted the FIRS Roller Hockey World Cup , where the best finish is sixth . Angola is also often believed to have historic roots in the martial art `` Capoeira Angola '' and `` Batuque ( game ) '' which were practiced by Slavery in Angola transported as part of the Atlantic slave trade .

Benin ( , ; Bnin ) , officially the Republic of Benin ( Rpublique du Bnin ) ( formerly known as Republic of Dahomey ) , is a country in West Africa . It is bordered by Togo to the west , Nigeria to the east , Burkina Faso to the north-west , and Niger to the north-east . The majority of its population lives on the small southern coastline of the Bight of Benin , part of the Gulf of Guinea in the northernmost tropical portion of the Atlantic Ocean . The capital of Benin is Porto-Novo , but the seat of government is in Cotonou , the country 's largest city and economic capital . Benin covers an area of and its population in was estimated to be approximately million . Benin is a tropical nation , highly dependent on agriculture , and is a large exporter of cotton and palm oil . Substantial employment and income arise from subsistence agriculture .
The official language of Benin is French , with several indigenous languages such as Fon language , Bariba language , Yoruba language and Dendi language also being commonly spoken . The largest religious group in Benin is Catholic Church , followed closely by Islam , Vodun ( commonly referred to as Voodoo outside the country ) and Protestantism . Benin is a member of the United Nations , the African Union , the Economic Community of West African States , the Organisation of Islamic Cooperation , the South Atlantic Peace and Cooperation Zone , Organisation internationale de la Francophonie , the Community of SahelSaharan States , the African Petroleum Producers Association and the Niger Basin Authority .
Little is known of Benin 's early history . From the 17th to the 19th century , the main political entities in the area were the Kingdom of Dahomey , along with the city-state of Porto-Novo , and a large area with many different nations to the north . This region was referred to as the Slave Coast of West Africa from as early as the 17th century due to the large number of enslaved people who were shipped to the New World during the Trans-Atlantic slave trade . After enslavement was abolished , France took over the country and renamed it French Dahomey . In 1960 , Dahomey gained full independence from France . The sovereign state has had a tumultuous history since then , with many different democratic governments , military coups , and military governments . A MarxistLeninist state called the People 's Republic of Benin existed between 1975 and 1990 . In 1991 , it was replaced by the current Multi-party system multi-party Republic of Benin .
==Etymology==
During the colonial period and at independence , the country was Geographical renaming Dahomey . On 30 November 1975 , it was renamed Benin . `` Dahomey changed its name to the Republic of Benin ( Rpublique du Benin ) in memory of pre-19th century greatness of Ancient Benin of Nigeria '' , referring to the historic Kingdom of Benin .
==History==
===Precolonial period===
The current country of Benin combines three areas which had distinctly different political systems and ethnicities prior to French colonial control . Before 1700 , there were a few important city-states along the coast ( primarily of the Aja people ethnic group , but also including Yoruba people and Gbe languages peoples ) and a mass of tribal regions inland ( composed of Bariba people , Mahi , Gedevi , and Kabye peoples ) . The Oyo Empire , located primarily to the east of modern Benin , was the most significant large-scale military force in the region . It regularly conducted raids and exacted tribute from the coastal kingdoms and the tribal regions . The situation changed in the 1600s and early 1700s as the Kingdom of Dahomey , consisting mostly of Fon people , was founded on the Abomey plateau and began taking over areas along the coast . By 1727 , king Agaja of the Kingdom of Dahomey had conquered the coastal cities of Allada and Ouidah , but it had become a tributary of the Oyo empire and did not directly attack the Oyo allied city-state of Porto-Novo . The rise of the kingdom of Dahomey , the rivalry between the kingdom and the city of Porto-Novo , and the continued tribal politics of the northern region , persisted into the colonial and post-colonial periods .
The Dahomey was known for its culture and traditions . Young boys were often apprenticed to older soldiers , and taught the kingdom 's military customs until they were old enough to join the army . Dahomey was also famous for instituting an elite female soldier corps , called Ahosi , i.e . the king 's wives , or Mino , `` our mothers '' in the Fon language Fongbe , and known by many Europeans as the Dahomean Amazons . This emphasis on military preparation and achievement earned Dahomey the nickname of `` black Sparta '' from European observers and 19th-century explorers such as Sir Richard Burton .
===Early Portuguese colonization and the slave trade===
The kings of Dahomey sold their war captives into Atlantic slave trade . They also had a practice of killing war captives in a ceremony known as the Annual Customs of Dahomey . By about 1750 , the King of Dahomey was earning an estimated 250,000 per year by selling African captives to European slave-traders .
Though the leaders of Dahomey appear to have initially resisted the slave trade , it flourished in the region of Dahomey for almost three hundred years , beginning in 1472 with a trade agreement with Portuguese Empire merchants . The area was named the Slave Coast of West Africa `` Slave Coast '' because of this flourishing trade . Court protocols , which demanded that a portion of war captives from the kingdom 's many battles be decapitated , decreased the number of enslaved people exported from the area . The number went from 102,000 people per decade in the 1780s to 24,000 per decade by the 1860s . The decline was partly due to the Slave Trade Act 1807 banning the trans-Atlantic slave trade by Britain in 1808 , followed by other countries . This decline continued until 1885 , when the last slave ship departed from the coast of the modern Benin Republic bound for Brazil in South America , which had yet to abolish slavery . The capital 's name Porto-Novo is of Portuguese origin , meaning `` New Port '' . It was originally developed as a port for the slave trade .
Among the goods the Portuguese sought were carved items of ivory made by Benin  s artisans in the form of carved saltcellars , spoons , and hunting horns - the first pieces of African art produced for sale abroad as exotic objects .
===French colonial period===
By the middle of the nineteenth century , Dahomey had begun to weaken and lose its status as the regional power . This enabled the French to take over the area in 1892 . In 1899 , the French included the land called French Dahomey within the larger French West Africa colonial region .
In 1958 , France granted autonomy to the Republic of Dahomey , and full independence on 1 August 1960 , which is celebrated each year as Independence Day , a Public holidays in Benin . The president who led the country to independence was Hubert Maga .
===Post-colonial period===
For the next twelve years after 1960 , ethnic strife contributed to a period of turbulence . There were several coups and regime changes , with the figures of Hubert Maga , Sourou Migan Apithy , Justin Ahomadgb , and mile Derlin Zinsou dominating ; the first three each represented a different area and ethnicity of the country . These three agreed to form a Presidential Council ( Benin ) after violence marred the 1970 elections .
On 7 May 1972 , Maga ceded power to Ahomadgb . On 26 October 1972 , Lt. Col. Mathieu Krkou overthrew the ruling triumvirate , becoming president and stating that the country would not `` burden itself by copying foreign ideology , and wants neither Capitalism , Communism , nor Socialism '' . On 30 November 1974 however , he announced that the country was officially Marxism , under control of the Military Council of the Revolution ( CMR ) , which nationalized the petroleum industry and banks . On 30 November 1975 , he renamed the country to the People 's Republic of Benin .
The CMR was dissolved in 1979 , and Krkou arranged show elections in which he was the only allowed candidate . Establishing relations with China , North Korea , and Great Socialist People 's Libyan Arab Jamahiriya , he put nearly all businesses and economic activities under state control , causing foreign investment in Benin to dry up . Krkou attempted to reorganize education , pushing his own aphorisms such as `` Poverty is not a fatality '' , resulting in a mass emigration of teachers , along with numerous other professionals . The regime financed itself by contracting to take nuclear waste , first from the Soviet Union and later from France .
In 1980 , Krkou converted to Islam and changed his first name to Ahmed . He changed his name back after claiming to be a born-again Christian . In 1989 , riots broke out when the regime did not have enough money to pay its army . The banking system collapsed . Eventually , Krkou renounced Marxism , and a convention forced Krkou to release political prisoners and arrange elections . MarxismLeninism was abolished as the nation 's form of government .
The country 's name was officially changed to the Republic of Benin on 1 March 1990 , after the newly formed government 's constitution was completed .
In a 1991 election , Krkou lost to Nicphore Soglo . Krkou returned to power after winning the 1996 vote . In 2001 , a closely fought election resulted in Krkou winning another term , after which his opponents claimed election irregularities .
In 1999 , Krkou issued a national apology for the substantial role that Africans had played in the Atlantic slave trade .
Krkou and former president Soglo did not run in the 2006 elections , as both were barred by the constitution 's restrictions on age and total terms of candidates .
On 5 March 2006 , Beninese presidential election , 2006 was held that was considered free and fair . It resulted in a Two-round system between Thomas Boni Yayi and Adrien Houngbdji . The runoff election was held on 19 March and was won by Boni , who assumed office on 6 April . The success of the fair multi-party elections in Benin won praise internationally . Boni was Beninese presidential election , 2011 , taking 53.18 % of the vote in the first roundenough to avoid a runoff election . He was the first president to win an election without a runoff since the restoration of democracy in 1991.
In the Beninese presidential election , 2016 , in which Boni Yayi was barred by the constitution from running for a third term , businessman Patrice Talon won the second round with 65.37 % of the vote , defeating investment banker and former Prime Minister Lionel Zinsou . Talon was sworn in on 6 April 2016 . Speaking on the same day that the Constitutional Court confirmed the results , Talon said that he would `` first and foremost tackle constitutional reform '' , discussing his plan to limit presidents to a single term of five years in order to combat `` complacency '' . He also said that he planned to slash the size of the government from 28 to 16 members .
==Politics==
Benin 's politics take place in a framework of a presidential system representative democracy republic , in which the President of Benin is both [ of state ] and [ of government ] , within a multi-party system . Executive power is exercised by the government . Legislative power is vested in both the government and the legislature . The judiciary is independent of the executive and the legislature . The political system is derived from the 1990 Constitution of Benin and the subsequent transition to democracy in 1991.
Benin scored highly in the 2013 Ibrahim Index of African Governance , which comprehensively measures the state of governance across the continent . Benin was ranked 18th out of 52 African countries and scored best in the categories of Safety & Rule of Law and Participation & Human Rights .
In its 2007 Worldwide Press Freedom Index , Reporters Without Borders ranked Benin 53rd out of 169 countries .
Benin has been rated equal-88th out of 159 countries in a 2005 analysis of police , business , and political corruption .

The majority of Benin 's 11,485,000 inhabitants live in the south of the country . The population is young , with a life expectancy of 62 years . About 42 African ethnic groups live in this country , including the Yoruba people in the southeast ( migrated from what is now Nigeria in the 12th century ) ; the Dendi people in the north-central area ( who came from Mali in the 16th century ) ; the Bariba people and the Fula people in the northeast ; the Betammaribe and the Somba people in the Atakora Mountains ; the Fon people in the area around Abomey in the South Central and the Mina people , Xueda people , and Aja people ( who came from Togo ) on the coast .
Recent migrations have brought other African nationals to Benin that include Nigerians , Togolese , and Malians . The foreign community also includes many Lebanese and Indians involved in trade and commerce . The personnel of the many European embassies and foreign aid missions and of nongovernmental organisations and various missionary groups account for a large part of the 5,500 European population . A small part of the European population consists of Beninese citizens of French people .
===Largest cities===
== Religion ==
In the 2013 census , 48.5 % of the population of Benin were Christianity ( 25.5 % Roman Catholic , 6.7 % Celestial Church of Christ , 3.4 % Methodist , 12.9 % other Christian denominations ) , 27.7 % were Muslim , 11.6 % practiced Vodun , 2.6 % practiced other local traditional religions , 2.6 % practiced other religions , and 5.8 % claimed no religious affiliation . A government survey conducted by the Demographic and Health Surveys Program in 2011-2012 indicated that followers of Christianity had increased to 57.5 % of the population ( with Catholics making up 33.9 % , Methodists 3.0 % , Celestials 6.2 % and other Christians 14.5 % ) , while Muslims had declined to 22.8 % .
Traditional religions include local animism religions in the Atakora Department ( Atakora and Donga provinces ) , and Vodun and Orisha veneration among the Yoruba and Tado peoples in the center and south of the nation . The town of Ouidah on the central coast is the spiritual center of Beninese Vodun .
Today the two largest religions are Christianity , followed throughout the south and center of Benin and in Otammari country in the Atakora Department , and Islam , introduced by the Songhai Empire and Hausa merchants , and now followed throughout Alibori , Borgou and Donga Department provinces , as well as among the Yoruba ( who also follow Christianity ) . Many , however , continue to hold Vodun and Orisha beliefs and have incorporated the pantheon of Vodun and Orisha into Christianity . The Ahmadiyya Muslim Community , a sect originating in the 19th century , is also present in a significant minority .
== Geography and climate ==
Benin , a narrow , northsouth strip of land in West Africa , lies between latitudes 6th parallel north 6 and 13th parallel north 13N , and longitudes prime meridian 0 and 4th meridian east 4E . Benin is bounded by Togo to the west , Burkina Faso and Niger to the north , Nigeria to the east , and the Bight of Benin to the south . The distance from the Niger River in the north to the Atlantic Ocean in the south is about . Although the coastline measures , the country measures about at its widest point . Four terrestrial ecoregions lie within Benin 's borders : Eastern Guinean forests , Nigerian lowland forests , Guinean forest-savanna mosaic , and West Sudanian savanna . It had a 2018 Forest Landscape Integrity Index mean score of 5.86/10 , ranking it 93rd globally out of 172 countries .
Benin shows little variation in elevation and can be divided into four areas from the south to the north , starting with the low-lying , sandy , coastal plain ( highest elevation ) which is , at most , wide . It is marshy and dotted with lakes and lagoons communicating with the ocean . Behind the coast lies the Guinean forest-savanna mosaic-covered plateaus of southern Benin ( altitude between ) , which are split by valleys running north to south along the Couffo River , Zou River , and Oum Rivers .
This geography makes it Climate change vulnerability . With the majority of the country living near the coast in low-lying areas sea level rise could have large effects on the economy and population . Northern areas will see additional regions become deserts , making agriculture difficult in a region with many subsistence farmers .
An area of flat land dotted with rocky hills whose altitude seldom reaches extends around Nikki and Save .
A range of mountains extends along the northwest border and into Togo ; these are the Togo Mountains . The highest point , Mont Sokbaro , is at . Benin has fallow fields , mangroves , and remnants of large sacred forests . In the rest of the country , the savanna is covered with thorny scrub and dotted with huge Adansonia digitata trees . Some forests line the banks of rivers . In the north and the northwest of Benin , the W National Park and Pendjari National Park attract tourists eager to see elephants , lions , antelopes , hippos , and monkeys . Pendjari National Park together with the bordering Parks Arli National Park and W National Park in Burkina Faso and Niger are among the most important strongholds for the endangered West African lion . With an estimated 356 ( range : 246466 ) lions , W-Arli-Pendjari harbors the largest remaining population of lions in West Africa . Historically Benin has served as habitat for the endangered painted hunting dog , Lycaon pictus ; however , this canid is thought to have been locally Local extinction .
Benin 's climate is hot and humid . Annual rainfall in the coastal area averages 1300 ; mm or about 51 ; inches . Benin has two rainy and two dry seasons per year . The principal rainy season is from April to late July , with a shorter less intense rainy period from late September to November . The main dry season is from December to April , with a short cooler dry season from late July to early September . Temperatures and humidity are high along the tropical coast . In Cotonou , the average maximum temperature is ; the minimum is .
Variations in temperature increase when moving north through savanna and plateau toward the Sahel . A dry wind from the Sahara called the Harmattan blows from December to March , when grass dries up , other vegetation turns reddish brown , and a veil of fine dust hangs over the country , causing the skies to be overcast . It is also the season when farmers burn brush in the fields .
==Economy==
The economy of Benin is dependent on subsistence agriculture , cotton production , and regional trade . Cotton accounts for 40 % of the GDP and roughly 80 % of official export receipts . Growth in real output has averaged around 5 % in the past seven years , but rapid population growth has offset much of this increase . Inflation has subsided over the past several years . Benin uses the CFA franc , which is pegged to the euro .
Benin 's economy has continued to strengthen over the past years , with real GDP growth estimated at 5.1 and 5.7 % in 2008 and 2009 , respectively . The main driver of growth is the agricultural sector , with cotton being the country 's main export , while services continue to contribute the largest part of GDP largely because of Benin 's geographical location , enabling trade , transportation , transit and tourism activities with its neighboring states . Benin 's overall macroeconomic conditions were positive in 2017 , with a growth rate of around 5.6 percent . Economic growth was largely driven by Benin 's cotton industry and other cash crops , the Port of Cotonou , and telecommunications . Cashew and pineapple production and processing have substantial commercial potential . The country 's primary source of revenue is the Port of Cotonou , although the government is seeking to expand its revenue base . In 2017 , Benin imported about $ 2.8 billion in goods such as rice , meat and poultry , alcoholic beverages , fuel plastic materials , specialized mining and excavating machinery , telecommunications equipment , passenger vehicles , and toiletries and cosmetics . Principal exports are ginned cotton , cotton cake and cotton seeds , cashew , shea butter , cooking oil , and lumber .
Access to biocapacity in Benin is lower than world average . In 2016 , Benin had 0.9 global hectares of biocapacity per person within its territory , much less than the world average of 1.6 global hectares per person . In 2016 Benin used 1.4 global hectares of biocapacity per person - their ecological footprint of consumption . This means they use slightly under double as much biocapacity as Benin contains . As a result , Benin is running a biocapacity deficit .
In order to raise growth still further , Benin plans to attract more foreign investment , place more emphasis on Tourism in Benin , facilitate the development of new food processing systems and agricultural products , and encourage new information and communication technology . Projects to improve the business climate by reforms to the land tenure system , the commercial justice system , and the financial sector were included in Benin 's US $ 307 million Millennium Challenge Account grant signed in February 2006.
The Paris Club and bilateral creditors have eased the external debt situation , with Benin benefiting from a G8 debt reduction announced in July 2005 , while pressing for more rapid structural reforms . An insufficient electrical supply continues to adversely affect Benin 's economic growth though the government recently has taken steps to increase domestic power production .
Although trade unions in Benin represent up to 75 % of the formal workforce , the large informal economy has been noted by the International Trade Union Confederation ( ITCU ) to contain ongoing problems , including a lack of women 's wage equality , the use of child labour , and the continuing issue of unfree labour .
Benin is a member of the Organization for the Harmonization of Business Law in Africa ( OHADA ) .
Cotonou has the country 's only seaport and Cadjehoun Airport . A new port is currently under construction between Cotonou and Porto Novo . Benin is connected by two-lane asphalted roads to its neighboring countries ( Togo , Burkina Faso , Niger , and Nigeria ) . Mobile telephone service is available across the country through various Mobile Network Code . ADSL connections are available in some areas . Benin is connected to the Internet by way of satellite connections ( since 1998 ) and a single submarine cable SAT-3/WASC ( cable system ) SAT-3/WASC ( since 2001 ) , keeping the price of data extremely high . Relief is expected with the initiation of the ACE ( cable system ) cable in 2011.
Despite the GDP growth rate of 4-5 % remaining consistent over the past two decades , poverty has been increasing . According to the National Institute of Statistics and Economic Analysis in Benin , those living under the poverty line have increased from 36.2 % in 2011 to 40.1 % in 2015.
==Education==
The literacy rate in Benin is among the lowest in the world : in 2015 it was estimated to be 38.4 % ( 49.9 % for males and 27.3 % for females ) . Benin has achieved universal primary education and half of the children ( 54 % ) were enrolled in secondary education in 2013 , according to the UNESCO Institute for Statistics .
Although at one time the education system was not free , Benin has abolished school fees and is carrying out the recommendations of its 2007 Educational Forum .
The government has devoted more than 4 % of GDP to education since 2009 . In 2015 , public expenditure on education ( all levels ) amounted to 4.4 % of GDP , according to the UNESCO Institute for Statistics . Within this expenditure , Benin devoted quite a large share to tertiary education : 0.97 % of GDP .
Between 2009 and 2011 , the share of young people enrolled at university rose from 10 % to 12 % of the 1825 year age cohort , one of the highest ratios in West Africa . Student enrollment in tertiary education more than doubled between 2006 and 2011 from 50,225 to 110,181 . These statistics encompass not only bachelor 's , master 's and Ph.D. programmes but also students enrolled in non-degree post-secondary diplomas .
==Science and technology==
=== National policy framework ===
The Ministry of Higher Education and Scientific Research is responsible for implementing science policy . The National Directorate of Scientific and Technological Research handles planning and coordination , whereas the National Council for Scientific and Technical Research and National Academy of Sciences , Arts , and Letters each play an advisory role . Financial support comes from Benin 's National Fund for Scientific Research and Technological Innovation . The Benin Agency for the Promotion of Research Results and Technological Innovation carries out technology transfer through the development and dissemination of research results .
The regulatory framework has evolved since 2006 till date when the country 's first science policy was prepared . This has since been updated and complemented by new texts on science and innovation ( the year of adoption is between brackets ) :
* a manual for monitoring and evaluating research structures and organizations ( 2013 ) ;
* a manual on how to select research programmes and projects and apply to the National Fund for Scientific Research and Technological Innovation ( 2013 ) for competitive grants ;
* a draft act for funding scientific research and innovation and a draft code of ethics for scientific research and innovation were both submitted to the Supreme Court in 2014 ;
* a strategic plan for scientific research and innovation ( under development in 2015 ) .
Equally important are Benin 's efforts to integrate science into existing policy documents :
* Benin Development Strategies 2025 : Benin 2025 Alafia ( 2000 ) ;
* Growth Strategy for Poverty Reduction 20112016 ( 2011 ) ;
* Phase 3 of the Ten-year Development Plan for the Education Sector , covering 20132015 ;
* Development Plan for Higher Education and Scientific Research 20132017 ( 2014 ) .
In 2015 , Benin 's priority areas for scientific research were : health , education , construction and building materials , transportation and trade , culture , tourism and handicrafts , cotton/textiles , food , energy and climate change .
The main challenges facing research and development in Benin are :
* the unfavorable organizational framework for research : weak governance , a lack of co-operation between research structures and the absence of an official document on the status of researchers ;
* the inadequate use of human resources and the lack of any motivational policy for researchers ; and
* the mismatch between research and development needs .
=== Human and financial investment in research ===
In 2007 , Benin counted 1,000 researchers ( in headcounts ) . This corresponds to 115 researchers per million inhabitants . The main research structures in Benin are the Centre for Scientific and Technical Research , National Institute of Agricultural Research , National Institute for Training and Research in Education , Office of Geological and Mining Research and the Centre for Entomological Research .
The University of Abomey-Calavi was selected by the World Bank in 2014 to participate in its Centres of Excellence project , owing to its expertise in applied mathematics . Within this project , the World Bank has loaned $ 8 million to Benin . The Association of African Universities has also received funds to enable it to co-ordinate knowledge-sharing among the 19 universities in West Africa involved in the project .
There are no available data on Benin 's level of investment in research and development .
In 2013 , the government devoted 2.5 % of GDP to public health . In December 2014 , 150 volunteer health professionals travelled to Guinea , Liberia and Sierra Leone from Benin , Cte d'Ivoire , Ghana , Mali , Niger , and Nigeria , as part of a joint initiative by the Economic Community of West African States ( ECOWAS ) and its specialized agency , the West African Health Organisation , to help combat the epidemic . The Ebola epidemic has been a tragic reminder of the chronic underinvestment in West African health systems .
The Government of Benin devoted less than 5 % of GDP to agricultural development in 2010 , even though the members of the African Union had agreed to commit at least 10 % of GDP to this area in the Maputo Declaration of 2003 . They reiterated this goal in the Malabo Declaration adopted in Equatorial Guinea in 2014 . In the latter declaration , they reaffirmed their 'intention to devote 10 % of their national budgets to agricultural development and agreed to targets such as doubling agricultural productivity , halving post-harvest loss and bringing stunting down to 10 % across Africa ' . However , African leaders meeting in Equatorial Guinea failed to resolve the debate on establishing a common standard of measurement for the 10 % target .
=== Research output ===
Benin has the third-highest publication intensity for scientific journals in West Africa , according to Thomson Reuters ' Web of Science , Science Citation Index Expanded . There were 25.5 scientific articles per million inhabitants cataloged in this database in 2014 . This compares with 65.0 for the Gambia , 49.6 for Cape Verde , 23.2 for Senegal and 21.9 for Ghana . The volume of publications in this database tripled in Benin between 2005 and 2014 from 86 to 270 . Between 2008 and 2014 , Benin 's main scientific collaborators were based in France ( 529 articles ) , United States ( 261 ) , United Kingdom ( 254 ) , Belgium ( 198 ) and Germany ( 156 ) .
==Transportation==
Transport in Benin includes road , rail , water and air transportation . Benin possesses a total of 6,787 ; km of [ of which 1,357 ; km are paved . Of the paved highways in the country , there are 10 Controlled-access highway expressways ] . This leaves 5,430 ; km of unpaved road . The [ [ TransWest African Coastal Highway Trans-West African Coastal Highway crosses Benin , connecting it to Nigeria to the east , and Togo , Ghana and Ivory Coast to the west . When construction in Liberia and Sierra Leone is finished , the highway will continue west to seven other Economic Community of West African States ( ECOWAS ) nations . A paved highway also connects Benin northwards to Niger , and through that country to Burkina Faso and Mali to the north-west .
Rail transport in Benin consists of of Single track ( rail ) , railway . Benin does not , at this time , share railway links with adjacent countries , but construction work has commenced on international lines connecting Benin with Niger and Nigeria , with outline plans announced for further connections to Togo and Burkina Faso . Benin will be a participant in the AfricaRail project .
Cadjehoun Airport , located at Cotonou , has direct international jet service to Accra , Niamey , Monrovia , Lagos , Ouagadougou , Lom , and Douala , as well as other cities in Africa . Direct services also link Cotonou to Paris , Brussels , and Istanbul .
== Health ==
The HIV/AIDS rate in Benin was estimated in 2013 at 1.13 % of adults aged 1549 years . Malaria is a problem in Benin , being a leading cause of morbidity and mortality among children younger than five years .
During the 1980s , less than 30 % of the country 's population had access to primary health care services . Benin had one of the highest death rates for children under the age of five in the world . Its infant mortality rate stood at 203 deaths for every live births . Only one in three mothers had access to child health care services . The Bamako Initiative changed that dramatically by introducing community-based healthcare reform , resulting in more efficient and equitable provision of services . , Benin had the 26th highest rate of maternal mortality in the world . According to a 2013 UNICEF report , 13 % of women had undergone female genital mutilation . A comprehensive approach strategy was extended to all areas of healthcare , with subsequent improvement in the health care indicators and improvement in health care efficiency and cost . Demographic and Health Surveys has completed three surveys in Benin since 1996.
==Culture==
===Arts===
Beninese literature had a strong oral tradition long before French became the dominant language . Flix Couchoro wrote the first Beninese novel , L'Esclave ( Beninese novel ) L'Esclave ( The Slave ) , in 1929.
Post-independence , the country was home to a vibrant and innovative music scene , where native folk music combined with Ghanaian [ French cabaret ] , American [ [ rock and roll , funk and soul music , and Music of the Democratic Republic of the Congo African Rumba .
Singer Anglique Kidjo and actor Djimon Hounsou were born in Cotonou , Benin . Composer Wally Badarou and singer Gnonnas Pedro are also of Beninese descent .
Biennale Benin , continuing the projects of several organizations and artists , started in the country in 2010 as a collaborative event called `` Regard Benin '' . In 2012 , the project became a Biennial coordinated by the Consortium , a federation of local associations . The international exhibition and artistic program of the 2012 Biennale Benin are curated by Abdellah Karroum and the Curatorial Delegation .
A number of Beninese artists have received major international recognition , such as Georges Adagbo , Meschac Gaba , Romuald Hazoum , Dominique Zinkp and Emo de Medeiros .
===Customary names===
Many Beninese in the south of the country have Akan name Akan-based names indicating the day of the week on which they were born . This is due to influence of the Akan people like the Akwamu and others .
===Language===
Local languages are used as the languages of instruction in elementary schools , with French only introduced after several years . In wealthier cities , however , French is usually taught at an earlier age . At the secondary school level , local language is generally forbidden and French is the sole language of instruction . Beninese languages are generally transcribed with a separate letter for each speech sound ( phoneme ) , rather than using diacritics as in French or digraph ( orthography ) as in English . This includes Beninese Yoruba language , which in Nigeria is written with both diacritics and digraphs . For instance , the mid vowels written  ,  ,  , o in French are written in Beninese languages , whereas the consonants are written ng and sh or ch in English are written  and c. However , digraphs are used for nasal vowels and the labial-velar consonants kp and gb , as in the name of the Fon language Fon gbe , and diacritics are used as tone ( linguistics ) . In French-language publications , a mixture of French and Beninese orthographies may be seen .
===Cuisine===
Beninese cuisine is known in Africa for its exotic ingredients and flavorful dishes . Beninese cuisine involves fresh meals served with a variety of key sauces . In southern Benin cuisine , the most common ingredient is Maize , often used to prepare dough which is mainly served with peanut- or tomato-based sauces . Fish and chicken are the most common meats used in southern Beninese cuisine , but beef , goat , and Aethomys are also consumed . The main staple in northern Benin is Yam ( vegetable ) , often served with sauces mentioned above . The population in the northern provinces use beef and pork meat which is fried in palm or peanut oil or cooked in sauces . Cheese is used in some dishes . Couscous , rice , and beans are commonly eaten , along with fruits such as mangoes , oranges , avocados , bananas , kiwi fruit , and pineapples .
Meat is usually quite expensive , and meals are generally light on meat and generous on vegetable fat . Frying in palm or peanut oil is the most common meat preparation , and smoked fish is commonly prepared in Benin . Grinders are used to prepare Cornmeal , which is made into a dough and served with sauces . `` Chicken on the spit '' is a traditional recipe in which chicken is roasted over a fire on wooden sticks . Arecaceae roots are sometimes soaked in a jar with salt water and sliced garlic to tenderize them , then used in dishes . Many people have outdoor mud stoves for cooking .
===Sports===
Association football is generally considered the most popular sport in Benin . In the past decade , baseball has been introduced to the country .

== Etymology ==
The name for Japan in Japanese language is written using the kanji and pronounced Nippon or Nihon . Before it was adopted in the early 8th century , the country was known in China as Wa ( Japan ) ( ) and in Japan by the endonym Yamato . Nippon , the original Sino-Japanese reading of the characters , is favored for official uses , including on Japanese yen and postage stamps . Nihon is typically used in everyday speech and reflects shifts in Japanese phonology during the Edo period . The characters mean `` sun origin '' . It is the source of the popular Western epithet `` Land of the Rising Sun '' .
The name Japan is based on the Chinese pronunciation and was introduced to European languages through early trade . In the 13th century , Marco Polo recorded the early Mandarin Chinese or Wu Chinese pronunciation of the characters  labels=no as Cipangu . The old Malay language name for Japan , Japang or Japun , was borrowed from a southern coastal Chinese dialect and encountered by Portuguese Empire traders in Southeast Asia , who brought the word to Europe in the early 16th century . The first version of the name in English appears in a book published in 1577 , which spelled the name as Giapan in a translation of a 1565 Portuguese letter .
== History ==
=== Prehistoric to classical history ===
A Japanese Paleolithic from around 30,000 ; BC constitutes the first known habitation of the Japanese archipelago . This was followed from around 14,500 ; BC ( the start of the Jmon period ) by a Mesolithic to Neolithic semi-sedentary [ culture characterized by Pit-house pit dwelling ] and rudimentary agriculture . [ [ Jmon pottery from the period are among the oldest surviving examples of pottery . From around 1000 BC , Yayoi period # Origin of the Yayoi people began to enter the archipelago from Kyushu , intermingling with the Jomon people ; the Yayoi period saw the introduction of practices including Paddy field wet-rice farming , a new Yayoi pottery , and metallurgy from China and Korea . According to legend , Emperor Jimmu ( grandson of Amaterasu ) founded Yamatai in central Japan in 660 BC , beginning a Imperial House of Japan .
Japan first appears in written history in the Chinese Book of Han , completed in 111 AD . Buddhism was introduced to Japan from Baekje ( a Korean kingdom ) in 552 , but the development of Buddhism in Japan was primarily influenced by China . Despite early resistance , Buddhism was promoted by the ruling class , including figures like Prince Shtoku , and gained widespread acceptance beginning in the Asuka period ( 592710 ) .
The far-reaching Taika Reforms in 645 nationalized all land in Japan , to be Equal-field system among cultivators , and ordered the compilation of a household registry as the basis for a new system of taxation . The Jinshin War of 672 , a bloody conflict between Prince ama and his nephew Prince tomo , became a major catalyst for further administrative reforms . These reforms culminated with the promulgation of the Taih Code , which consolidated existing statutes and established the structure of the central and subordinate local governments . These legal reforms created the ritsury state , a system of Chinese-style centralized government that remained in place for half a millennium .
The Nara period ( 710784 ) marked the emergence of a Japanese state centered on the Imperial Court in Heij Palace Heij-ky ( modern Nara , Nara ) .

This marked the beginning of the Heian period ( 7941185 ) , during which a distinctly indigenous Japanese culture emerged . Murasaki Shikibu 's The Tale of Genji and the lyrics of Japan 's national anthem `` Kimigayo '' were written during this time .
=== Feudal era ===
Japan 's feudal era was characterized by the emergence and dominance of a ruling class of warriors , the samurai . In 1185 , following the defeat of the Taira clan in the Genpei War , samurai Minamoto no Yoritomo established a military government at Kamakura , Kanagawa . After Yoritomo 's death , the Hj clan came to power as regents for the shguns . The Zen school of Buddhism was introduced from China in the Kamakura period ( 11851333 ) and became popular among the samurai class . The Kamakura shogunate repelled Mongol invasions of Japan in 1274 and 1281 but was eventually Kenmu Restoration by Emperor Go-Daigo . Go-Daigo was defeated by Ashikaga Takauji in 1336 , beginning the Muromachi period ( 13361573 ) . The succeeding Ashikaga shogunate failed to control the feudal warlords ( daimys ) and a nin War , opening the century-long Sengoku period ( `` Warring States '' ) .
During the 16th century , Portuguese traders and Society of Jesus Missionary reached Japan for the first time , initiating direct Nanban trade and Nanban art exchange between Japan and the West .

The shogunate enacted measures including buke shohatto , as a code of conduct to control the autonomous daimys , and in 1639 the isolationist sakoku ( `` closed country '' ) policy that spanned the two and a half centuries of tenuous political unity known as the Edo period ( 16031868 ) . Modern Japan 's economic growth began in this period , resulting in Kaid and water transportation routes , as well as financial instruments such as futures contracts , banking and insurance of the Osaka rice brokers . The study of Western sciences ( rangaku ) continued through contact with the Dutch enclave in Nagasaki . The Edo period gave rise to kokugaku ( `` national studies '' ) , the study of Japan by the Japanese .
=== Modern era ===
In 1854 , Matthew C. Perry and the `` Black Ships '' of the United States Navy forced the opening of Japan to the outside world with the Convention of Kanagawa .

Adopting Western political , judicial , and military institutions , the Cabinet of Japan organized the Privy Council ( Japan ) , introduced the Meiji Constitution , and assembled the National Diet . During the Meiji era ( 18681912 ) , the Empire of Japan emerged as the most developed nation in Asia and as an industrialized world power that pursued military conflict to expand its sphere of influence . After victories in the First Sino-Japanese War ( 18941895 ) and the Russo-Japanese War ( 19041905 ) , Japan gained control of Taiwan , Korea and the southern half of Sakhalin . The Japanese population doubled from 35 million in 1873 to 70 million by 1935 , with a significant shift to urbanization .

The 1920s saw a political shift towards Statism in Shwa Japan , a period of lawlessness following the 1923 Great Tokyo Earthquake , the passing of Peace Preservation Law # Public Security Preservation Law of 1925 , and a series of May 15 Incident . This process accelerated during the 1930s , spawning a number of radical nationalist groups that shared a hostility to liberal democracy and a dedication to expansion in Asia . In 1931 , Japan Japanese invasion of Manchuria ; following Lytton Report , it resigned from the League of Nations two years later . In 1936 , Japan signed the Anti-Comintern Pact with Nazi Germany ; the 1940 Tripartite Pact made it one of the Axis Powers .

In 1940 , the Empire Japanese invasion of French Indochina , after which the United States placed an oil embargo on Japan . On December 78 , 1941 , Japanese forces carried out surprise Attack on Pearl Harbor , as well as on United Kingdom forces in Battle of Malaya , Bombing of Singapore ( 1941 ) , and Battle of Hong Kong , among others , beginning Pacific War . Throughout areas occupied by Japan during the war , numerous abuses were committed against local inhabitants , with many forced into Comfort women . After Allies of World War II victories during the next four years , which culminated in the Soviet invasion of Manchuria and the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki in 1945 , Japan agreed to an Surrender of Japan . The war cost Japan Japanese colonial empire and millions of lives . The Allies ( led by the United States ) repatriated millions of Japanese diaspora from their former colonies and military camps throughout Asia , largely eliminating the Japanese empire and its influence over the territories it conquered . The Allies convened the International Military Tribunal for the Far East to prosecute Japanese leaders for Japanese war crimes .
In 1947 , Japan adopted a new Constitution of Japan emphasizing liberal democratic practices . The Occupation of Japan ended with the Treaty of San Francisco in 1952 , and Japan was granted membership in the United Nations in 1956 . A Japanese economic miracle propelled Japan to become the second-largest economy in the world ; this ended in the mid-1990s after the popping of an Japanese asset price bubble , beginning the Lost Decade ( Japan ) `` Lost Decade '' . On March 11 , 2011 , Japan suffered one of the 2011 Thoku earthquake and tsunami , triggering the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear disaster . On May 1 , 2019 , after the historic abdication of Emperor Akihito , his son Naruhito became Emperor , beginning the Reiwa era .

Colombia ( , ; ) , officially the Republic of Colombia ( ) , is a country in South America with Insular region of Colombia in North America . Colombia is bounded on the north by the Caribbean Sea , the northwest by Panama , the south by Ecuador and Peru , the east by Venezuela , the southeast by Brazil , and the west by the Pacific Ocean . It comprises 32 Departments of Colombia and the Capital District of Bogot , the country 's largest city .
With over 50 million inhabitants Colombia is one of the most Race and ethnicity in Colombia and Languages of Colombia diverse countries in the world , with its rich cultural heritage reflecting influences by various Amerindian civilizations , European settlement , forced African labor , and immigration from Europe and the greater Middle East . Urban centres are concentrated in the Andean highlands and the Caribbean coast .
Colombia has been inhabited by various Indigenous peoples in Colombia since at least 12,000 BCE , including the Muisca , Quimbaya civilization , and the Tairona . The Spanish landed first in La Guajira in 1499 and by the mid-16th century annexed part of the region , establishing the New Kingdom of Granada , with Bogot as its capital . Spanish American wars of independence from Spain was achieved in 1810 , with what is now Colombia emerging as the United Provinces of New Granada . The new nation experimented with federalism as the Granadine Confederation ( 1858 ) , and then the United States of Colombia ( 1863 ) , before the Republic of Colombia was finally declared in 1886 . Separation of Panama from Colombia in 1903 , leading to Colombia 's present borders . Beginning in the 1960s , the country suffered from an asymmetric low-intensity Colombian armed conflict ( 1964present ) and political violence , both of which escalated in the 1990s . Since 2005 , there has been significant improvement in security , stability , and rule of law , as well as unprecedented economic growth and development .
Colombia is one of the world 's 17 megadiverse countries and has the second-highest level of Biodiversity of Colombia in the world . Its territory encompasses Amazon natural region , Andean natural region , Orinoqua natural region , and Tatacoa Desert , and it is the only country in South America with coastlines and islands along both the Caribbean natural region and Pacific/Choc natural region .
Colombia is considered a regional power in international affairs , being a member of major global and regional organizations including the United Nations , the World Trade Organization , the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development ( OECD ) , the Organization of American States , the Pacific Alliance , the Andean Community , and a NATO Global Partner . Colombia 's diversified economy is the third largest in South America , with macroeconomic stability and favorable long-term growth prospects .
== Etymology ==
The name `` Colombia '' is derived from the last name of the Italian navigator Christopher Columbus ( Cristoforo Colombo , link=no Cristbal Coln ) . It was conceived as a reference to all of the New World . The name was later adopted by the Gran Colombia of 1819 , formed from the territories of the old Viceroyalty of New Granada ( modern-day Colombia , Panama , Venezuela , Ecuador , and northwest Brazil ) .
When Venezuela , Ecuador , and Cundinamarca Department ( 1820 ) came to exist as independent states , the former Provinces of the Republic of New Granada adopted the name `` Republic of New Granada '' . New Granada officially changed its name in 1858 to the Granadine Confederation . In 1863 the name was again changed , this time to United States of Colombia , before finally adopting its present name  the Republic of Colombia  in 1886.
To refer to this country , the Colombian government uses the terms Colombia and Repblica de Colombia .
== History ==
=== Pre-Columbian era ===
Owing to its location , the present territory of Colombia was a corridor of early human civilization from Mesoamerica and the Caribbean to the Andes and Amazon basin . The oldest archaeological finds are from the Pubenza archaeological site and El Totumo archaeological site sites in the Magdalena Valley southwest of Bogot . These sites date from the Paleo-Indians period ( 18,0008000 ; BCE ) . At Puerto Hormiga archaeological site and other sites , traces from the Archaic period in South America ( ~80002000 ; BCE ) have been found . Vestiges indicate that there was also early occupation in the regions of El Abra and Tequendama in Cundinamarca Department ( 1820 ) . The oldest pottery discovered in the Americas , found at San Jacinto archaeological site , dates to 50004000 ; BCE .
Indigenous people inhabited the territory that is now Colombia by 12,500 ; BCE . Nomadic [ tribes at the El Abra ] , [ [ Tibit and Tequendama sites near present-day Bogot traded with one another and with other cultures from the Magdalena River Valley . A site including eight miles of Pictogram that is under study at Serrana de la Lindosa was revealed in November 2020 . Their age is suggested as being 12,500 years old ( c. 10,480 B.C . ) by the anthropologists working on the site because of extinct fauna depicted . That would have been during the earliest known human occupation of the area now known as Colombia .
Between 5000 and 1000 ; BCE , hunter-gatherer tribes transitioned to agrarian societies ; fixed settlements were established , and pottery appeared . Beginning in the 1st millennium BCE , groups of Indigenous peoples of the Americas including the Muisca , Zen , Quimbaya civilization , and Tairona developed the political system of cacicazgos with a pyramidal structure of power headed by caciques . The Muisca inhabited mainly the area of what is now the Departments of Colombia of Boyac Department and Cundinamarca Department high plateau ( Altiplano Cundiboyacense ) where they formed the Muisca Confederation . They farmed maize , potato , quinoa , and cotton , and traded gold , Colombian emeralds , blankets , ceramic handicrafts , coca and especially Halite with neighboring nations . The Tairona inhabited northern Colombia in the isolated mountain range of Sierra Nevada de Santa Marta . The Quimbaya inhabited regions of the Cauca River Valley between the Cordillera Occidental ( Colombia ) and Cordillera Central ( Colombia ) Ranges of the Colombian Andes . Most of the Amerindians practiced agriculture and the social structure of each indigenous community was different . Some groups of indigenous people such as the Caribs lived in a state of permanent war , but others had less bellicose attitudes .
=== European annexation ===
Alonso de Ojeda ( who had sailed with Columbus ) reached the Guajira Peninsula in 1499 . Spanish explorers , led by Rodrigo de Bastidas , made the first exploration of the Caribbean Basin in 1500 . Christopher Columbus navigated near the Caribbean in 1502 . In 1508 , Vasco Nez de Balboa accompanied an expedition to the territory through the region of Gulf of Urab and they founded the town of Santa Mara la Antigua del Darin in 1510 , the first stable settlement on the continent .
Santa Marta was founded in 1525 , and Cartagena , Colombia in 1533 . Spanish conquistador Gonzalo Jimnez de Quesada led an expedition to the interior in April 1536 , and christened the districts through which he passed `` New Kingdom of Granada '' . In August 1538 , he founded provisionally its capital near the Muisca cacicazgo of Bacat , and named it `` Santa Fe '' . The name soon acquired a suffix and was called Santa Fe de Bogot . Two other notable journeys by early conquistadors to the interior took place in the same period . Sebastin de Belalczar , conqueror of Quito , traveled north and founded Cali , in 1536 , and Popayn , in 1537 ; from 1536 to 1539 , German conquistador Nikolaus Federmann crossed the Orinoqua Natural Region , Colombia and went over the Cordillera Oriental ( Colombia ) in a search for El Dorado , the `` city of gold '' . The legend and the gold would play a pivotal role in luring the Spanish and other Europeans to New Granada during the 16th and 17th centuries .
The List of conquistadors in Colombia made frequent alliances with the enemies of different indigenous communities . Indian auxiliaries were crucial to conquest , as well as to creating and maintaining empire . Indigenous peoples in New Granada experienced a decline in population due to conquest as well as Eurasian diseases , such as smallpox , to which they had no immunity . Regarding the land as deserted , the Spanish Crown sold properties to all persons interested in colonised territories , creating large farms and possession of mines .
In the 16th century , the nautical science in Spain reached a great development thanks to numerous scientific figures of the Casa de Contratacin and nautical science was an essential pillar of the Iberian ship development , 14001600 .
=== Colonial exchange ===
In 1542 , the region of New Granada , along with all other Spanish possessions in South America , became part of the Viceroyalty of Peru , with its capital in Lima . In 1547 , New Granada became the Captaincy-General of New Granada within the viceroyalty .
In 1549 , the Real Audiencia was created by a royal decree , and New Granada was ruled by the Royal Audience of Santa Fe de Bogot , which at that time comprised the provinces of Santa Marta , Rio de San Juan , Popayn , Guayana and Cartagena . But important decisions were taken from the colony to Spain by the Council of the Indies .
In the 16th century , Europeans began to bring Atlantic slave trade from Africa . Spain was the only European power that could not establish Factory ( trading post ) in Africa to purchase slaves ; therefore , the Spanish empire relied on the asiento system , awarding merchants ( mostly from Portuguese Empire , French colonial empire , South Sea Company # Slave trade under the Asiento , and the Dutch Empire ) the license to trade enslaved people to their overseas territories . Some people defended the human rights and freedoms of oppressed peoples . The indigenous peoples could not be enslaved because they were legally Commoners of the Spanish Crown . To protect the indigenous peoples , several forms of land ownership and regulation were established : resguardos , encomiendas and haciendas .
The Viceroyalty of New Granada was created in 1717 , then temporarily removed , and then re-established in 1739 . Its capital was Santa F de Bogot . This Viceroyalty included some other provinces of northwestern South America that had previously been under the jurisdiction of the New Spain or Viceroyalty of Peru and correspond mainly to today 's Venezuela , Ecuador , and Panama . So , Bogot became one of the principal administrative centers of the Spanish possessions in the New World , along with Lima and Mexico City , though it remained somewhat backward compared to those two cities in several economic and logistical ways .
After Great Britain declared war on Spain in 1739 , Battle of Cartagena de Indias quickly became the British forces ' top target , but an upset Spanish victory during the War of Jenkins ' Ear , a war with Great Britain for economic control of the Caribbean , cemented Spanish dominance in the Caribbean until the Seven Years ' War .
The 18th-century priest , botanist and mathematician Jos Celestino Mutis was delegated by Viceroy Antonio Caballero y Gngora to conduct an inventory of the nature of New Granada . Started in 1783 , this became known as the Royal Botanical Expedition to New Granada . It classified plants and wildlife , and founded the first astronomical observatory in the city of Santa Fe de Bogot . In July 1801 the Prussian scientist Alexander von Humboldt reached Santa Fe de Bogot where he met with Mutis . In addition , historical figures in the process of independence in New Granada emerged from the expedition as the astronomer Francisco Jos de Caldas , the scientist Francisco Antonio Zea , the zoologist Jorge Tadeo Lozano and the painter Salvador Rizo .
=== Independence ===
Since the beginning of the periods of conquest and colonization , there were several rebel movements against Spanish rule , but most were either crushed or remained too weak to change the overall situation . The last one that sought outright independence from Spain sprang up around 1810 and culminated in the Colombian Declaration of Independence , issued on 20 July 1810 , the day that is now celebrated as the nation 's Independence Day . This movement followed the independence of St. Domingue ( present-day Haiti ) in 1804 , which provided some support to an eventual leader of this rebellion : Simn Bolvar . Francisco de Paula Santander also would play a decisive role .
A movement was initiated by Antonio Nario , who opposed Spanish centralism and led the opposition against the Viceroyalty . Cartagena , Colombia became independent in November 1811 . In 1811 the United Provinces of New Granada were proclaimed , headed by Camilo Torres Tenorio . The emergence of two distinct ideological currents among the patriots ( federalism and Unitary state ) gave rise to a period of Patria Boba . Shortly after the Napoleonic Wars ended , Ferdinand VII , recently restored to the throne in Spain , unexpectedly decided Spanish reconquest of New Granada to retake most of northern South America . The viceroyalty was restored under the command of Juan Smano , whose regime punished those who participated in the patriotic movements , ignoring the political nuances of the Junta ( Spanish American Independence ) . The retribution stoked renewed rebellion , which , combined with a weakened Spain , made possible a successful rebellion led by the Venezuelan-born Military career of Simn Bolvar , who finally proclaimed Spanish American wars of independence in 1819 . The Royalist ( Spanish American Independence ) pro-Spanish resistance was defeated in 1822 in the present territory of Colombia and in 1823 in Venezuela .
The territory of the Viceroyalty of New Granada became the Gran Colombia , organized as a subdivisions of Gran Colombia of Colombia , Panama , Ecuador , Venezuela , parts of Guyana and Brazil and north of Maran River . The Congress of Ccuta in 1821 adopted a Colombian Constitution of 1821 for the new Republic . Simn Bolvar became the first President of Colombia , and Francisco de Paula Santander was made Vice President of Colombia . However , the new republic was unstable and three countries emerged from the collapse of Gran Colombia in 1830 ( New Granada , Ecuador and Venezuela ) .
Colombia was the first constitutional government in South America , and the Colombian Liberal Party and Colombian Conservative Party parties , founded in 1848 and 1849 , respectively , are two of the oldest surviving political parties in the Americas . Slavery was abolished in the country in 1851.
Internal political and territorial divisions led to the dissolution of Gran Colombia in 1830 . The so-called `` Cundinamarca Province '' adopted the name `` Republic of the New Granada '' , which it kept until 1858 when it became the `` Confederacin Granadina '' ( Granadine Confederation ) . After a Colombian Civil War ( 18601862 ) two-year civil war in 1863 , the `` United States of Colombia '' was created , lasting until 1886 , when the country finally became known as the Republic of Colombia . Internal divisions remained between the bipartisan political forces , occasionally igniting very bloody civil wars , the most significant being the Thousand Days ' War ( 18991902 ) .
=== 20th century ===
The United States of America 's intentions to influence the area ( especially the Panama Canal construction and control ) led to the Separation of Panama from Colombia in 1903 and the establishment of it as a nation . The United States paid Colombia $ 25,000,000 in 1921 , seven years after completion of the canal , for redress of President Theodore Roosevelt 's role in the creation of Panama , and Colombia recognized Panama under the terms of the ThomsonUrrutia Treaty . Colombia and Peru went to Leticia Incident because of territory disputes far in the Amazon basin . The war ended with a peace deal brokered by the League of Nations . The League finally awarded the disputed area to Colombia in June 1934.
Soon after , Colombia achieved some degree of political stability , which was interrupted by a bloody conflict that took place between the late 1940s and the early 1950s , a period known as La Violencia ( `` The Violence '' ) . Its cause was mainly mounting tensions between the two leading political parties , which subsequently ignited after the assassination of the Liberal presidential candidate Jorge Elicer Gaitn on 9 April 1948 . The ensuing riots in Bogot , known as El Bogotazo , spread throughout the country and claimed the lives of at least 180,000 Colombians .
Colombia entered the Korean War when Laureano Gmez was elected president . It was the only Latin American country to join the war in a direct military role as an ally of the United States . Particularly important was the resistance of the Colombian troops at Battle of Old Baldy .
The violence between the two political parties decreased first when Gustavo Rojas Pinilla deposed the Laureano Gmez of Colombia in a coup d'tat and negotiated with the guerrillas , and then under the Colombian Military Junta of General Gabriel Pars .
After Rojas ' deposition , the Colombian Conservative Party and Colombian Liberal Party agreed to create the National Front ( Colombia ) , a coalition that would jointly govern the country . Under the deal , the presidency would alternate between conservatives and liberals every 4 years for 16 years ; the two parties would have parity in all other elective offices . The National Front ended `` La Violencia '' , and National Front administrations attempted to institute far-reaching social and economic reforms in cooperation with the Alliance for Progress . Despite the progress in certain sectors , many social and political problems continued , and guerrilla groups were formally created such as the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia , the National Liberation Army ( Colombia ) and the 19th of April Movement M-19 to fight the government and political apparatus .
Since the 1960s , the country has suffered from an Asymmetric warfare Low intensity conflict low-intensity Colombian armed conflict ( 1964present ) between Military Forces of Colombia , Guerrilla movements in Colombia and Paramilitarism in Colombia . The conflict escalated in the 1990s , mainly in remote rural areas . Since the beginning of the armed conflict , [ rights defenders ] have fought for the respect for human rights , despite staggering opposition . Several guerrillas ' organizations decided to demobilize after peace negotiations in 19891994 .
The United States has been heavily involved in the conflict since its beginnings , when in the early 1960s the U.S. government encouraged the Colombian military to attack leftist militias in rural Colombia . This was part of the U.S. fight against communism . Mercenaries and multinational corporations such as Chiquita Brands International are some of the international actors that have contributed to the violence of the conflict .
Beginning in the mid-1970s Colombian drug cartels became major producers , processors and exporters of Illegal drug trade in Colombia , primarily Cannabis ( drug ) and cocaine .
On 4 July 1991 , a new Colombian Constitution of 1991 was promulgated . The changes generated by the new constitution are viewed as positive by Colombian society .
===21st century===
The administration of President lvaro Uribe ( 200210 ) , adopted the democratic security policy which included an integrated counter-terrorism and counter-insurgency campaign . The Government economic plan also promoted confidence in investors . As part of a controversial peace process the United Self-Defense Forces of Colombia ( right-wing paramilitaries ) as a formal organization had ceased to function . In February 2008 , millions of Colombians demonstrated against FARC and other outlawed groups .
After peace negotiations in Cuba , the Government of Colombia of President Juan Manuel Santos and guerrilla of FARC-EP announced a final agreement to end the conflict . However , a Colombian peace agreement referendum , 2016 to ratify the deal was unsuccessful . Afterward , the Colombian government and the FARC signed a revised Colombian peace process in November 2016 , which the Colombian congress approved . In 2016 , President Santos was awarded the 2016 Nobel Peace Prize . The Government began a process of attention and comprehensive reparation for victims of conflict . Colombia shows modest progress in the struggle to defend human rights , as expressed by Human Rights Watch . A Special Jurisdiction of Peace has been created to investigate , clarify , prosecute and punish serious human rights violations and grave breaches of international humanitarian law which occurred during the armed conflict and to satisfy victims ' right to justice . During his visit to Colombia , Pope Francis paid tribute to the victims of the conflict .
2010 ColombiaVenezuela diplomatic crisis Colombia 's relations with Venezuela have fluctuated due to ideological differences between both governments . Colombia has offered Humanitarian aid with food and medicines to mitigate the shortage of supplies in Venezuela . Colombia 's Foreign Ministry said that all efforts to resolve Crisis in Venezuela ( 2012present ) Venezuela 's crisis should be peaceful . Colombia proposed the idea of the Sustainable Development Goals and a final document was adopted by the United Nations . 201920 Colombian protests are a series of country-wide protests against inequality , police brutality , corruption and in favor of the Colombian peace process .
== Geography ==
The geography of Colombia is characterized by its six main Natural regions of Colombia that present their own unique characteristics , from the Andes mountain range region shared with Ecuador and Venezuela ; the Pacific Coastal region shared with Panama and Ecuador ; the Caribbean coastal region shared with Venezuela and Panama ; the Llanos ( plains ) shared with Venezuela ; the Amazon Rainforest region shared with Venezuela , Brazil , Peru and Ecuador ; to the Insular Region ( Colombia ) , comprising islands in both the Atlantic and Pacific oceans . It shares its maritime limits with Costa Rica , Nicaragua , Honduras , Jamaica , Haiti , and the Dominican Republic .
Colombia is bordered to the northwest by Panama , to the east by Venezuela and Brazil , and to the south by Ecuador and Peru ; it established its maritime boundaries with neighboring countries through seven agreements on the Caribbean Sea and three on the Pacific Ocean . It lies between latitudes 12th parallel north 12N and 4th parallel south 4S and between longitudes 67th meridian west 67 and 79th meridian west 79W .
Part of the Pacific Ring of Fire , a region of the world subject to earthquakes and volcano , in the interior of Colombia the Andes are the prevailing geographical feature . Most of Colombia 's population centers are located in these interior highlands . Beyond the Colombian Massif ( in the southwestern departments of Cauca Department and Nario Department ) , these are divided into three branches known as cordilleras ( mountain ranges ) : the Cordillera Occidental ( Colombia ) , running adjacent to the Pacific coast and including the city of Santiago de Cali ; the Cordillera Central ( Colombia ) , running between the Cauca River and Magdalena River valleys ( to the west and east , respectively ) and including the cities of Medelln , Manizales , Pereira , Colombia , and Armenia , Quindo ; and the Cordillera Oriental ( Colombia ) , extending northeast to the Guajira Peninsula and including Bogot , Bucaramanga , and Ccuta .
Peaks in the Cordillera Occidental exceed , and in the Cordillera Central and Cordillera Oriental they reach . At , Bogot is the highest city of its size in the world .
East of the Andes lies the savanna of the Llanos , part of the Orinoco River basin , and in the far southeast , the jungle of the Amazon rainforest . Together these lowlands comprise over half Colombia 's territory , but they contain less than 6 % of the population . To the north the Caribbean Region of Colombia , home to 21.9 % of the population and the location of the major port cities of Barranquilla and Cartagena , Colombia , generally consists of low-lying plains , but it also contains the Sierra Nevada de Santa Marta mountain range , which includes the country 's tallest peaks ( Pico Cristbal Coln and Pico Simn Bolvar ) , and the La Guajira Desert . By contrast the narrow and discontinuous Pacific Region of Colombia , backed by the Baud Mountains mountains , are sparsely populated and covered in dense vegetation . The principal Pacific port is Buenaventura , Colombia .
The main rivers of Colombia are Magdalena River , Cauca River , Guaviare River , Atrato River , Meta River , Putumayo River and Caquet River . Colombia has four main drainage systems : the Pacific drain , the Caribbean drain , the Orinoco Basin and the Amazon Basin . The Orinoco and Amazon River Rivers mark limits with Colombia to Venezuela and Peru respectively .
Protected areas and the `` National Park System '' cover an area of about and account for 12.77 % of the Colombian territory . Compared to neighboring countries , rates of deforestation in Colombia are still relatively low . Colombia had a 2018 Forest Landscape Integrity Index mean score of 8.26/10 , ranking it 25th globally out of 172 countries . Colombia is the sixth country in the world by magnitude of total renewable freshwater supply , and still has large reserves of freshwater .
=== Climate ===
The climate of Colombia is characterized for being tropical presenting variations within Natural regions of Colombia and depending on the altitude , temperature , [ winds and rainfall . The diversity of climate zones in Colombia is characterized for having tropical rainforest ] s , [ [ savannas , steppes , deserts and mountain climate .

The phrase land of Torke is used in the 15th-century The Digby Conversion of Saint Paul . Later usages can be found in the William Dunbar , the 16th century Manipulus Vocabulorum ( `` Turkie , Tartaria '' ) and Francis Bacon 's Sylva Sylvarum ( Turky ) . The modern spelling `` Turkey '' dates back to at least 1719 . The Turkish language name Trkiye was adopted in 1923 under the influence of European usage .
==History==
===Prehistory of Anatolia and Eastern Thrace===
The Anatolian peninsula , comprising most of modern Turkey , is one of the oldest permanently settled regions in the world . Various Ancient Anatolians populations have lived in Anatolia , from at least the Neolithic until the Hellenistic civilization . Many of these peoples spoke the Anatolian languages , a branch of the larger Indo-European language family : and , given the antiquity of the Indo-European Hittite language and Luwian language languages , some scholars have proposed Anatolian hypothesis Anatolia as the hypothetical centre from which the Indo-European languages radiated . The European part of Turkey , called Eastern Thrace , has also been inhabited since at least forty thousand years ago , and is known to have been in the Neolithic era by about 6000 BC .
Gbekli Tepe is the site of the oldest known man-made religious structure , a temple dating to circa 10,000 BC , while atalhyk is a very large Neolithic and Chalcolithic settlement in southern Anatolia , which existed from approximately 7500 BC to 5700 BC . It is the largest and best-preserved Neolithic site found to date and is a UNESCO World Heritage Site . The settlement of Troy started in the Neolithic Age and continued into the Iron Age .
The earliest recorded inhabitants of Anatolia were the Hattians and Hurrians , non-Indo-European peoples who inhabited central and eastern Anatolia , respectively , as early as c. 2300 BC . Indo-European Hittites came to Anatolia and gradually absorbed the Hattians and Hurrians c. 20001700 BC . The first major empire in the area was founded by the Hittites , from the 18th through the 13th century BC . The Assyrians conquered and settled parts of southeastern Turkey as early as 1950 BC until the year 612 BC , although they Assyrian continuity in the region , namely in Hakkari , rnak Province and Mardin province .
Urartu re-emerged in Assyrian inscriptions in the 9th century BC as a powerful northern rival of Assyria . Following the collapse of the Hittite empire c. 1180 BC , the Phrygians , an Indo-European people , achieved ascendancy in Anatolia until their kingdom was destroyed by the Cimmerians in the 7th century BC . Starting from 714 BC , Urartu shared the same fate and dissolved in 590 BC , when it was conquered by the Medes . The most powerful of Phrygia 's successor states were Lydia , Caria and Lycia .
===Antiquity===
Starting around 1200 BC , the coast of Anatolia was heavily settled by Aeolians and Ionians Ancient Greece . Numerous important cities were founded by these colonists , such as Miletus , Ephesus , Smyrna ( now zmir ) and Byzantium ( now Istanbul ) , the latter founded by Greeks colonists from Megara in 657 BC . The first state that was called Armenia by neighbouring peoples was the state of the Armenians Orontid dynasty , which included parts of eastern Turkey beginning in the 6th century BC . In Northwest Turkey , the most significant tribal group in Thrace was the Odrysian kingdom , founded by Teres I.
All of modern-day Turkey was conquered by the Persian Achaemenid Empire during the 6th century BC . The Greco-Persian Wars started when the Greek city states on the coast of Anatolia rebelled against Persian rule in 499 BC . The territory of Turkey later fell to Alexander the Great in 334 BC , which led to increasing cultural homogeneity and Hellenization in the area .
Following Alexander 's death in 323 BC , Anatolia was subsequently divided into a number of small Hellenistic kingdoms , all of which became part of the Roman Republic by the mid-1st century BC . The process of Hellenization that began with Alexander 's conquest accelerated under Roman rule , and by the early centuries of the Christian Era , the local Anatolian languages and cultures had become extinct , being largely replaced by ancient Greek language and culture . From the 1st century BC up to the 3rd century CE , large parts of modern-day Turkey were contested between the Roman Empire and neighbouring Parthian Empire through the frequent Roman-Parthian Wars .
===Early Christian and Byzantine period===
According to Acts of Apostles 11 , Antioch ( now Antakya ) , a city in southern Turkey , is the birthplace of the Early Christianity .
In 324 , Constantine I chose Byzantium to be the new capital of the Roman Empire , renaming it New Rome . Following the death of Theodosius I in 395 and the permanent division of the Roman Empire between his two sons , the city , which would popularly come to be known as Constantinople , became the capital of the Eastern Roman Empire . This empire , which would later be branded by historians as the Byzantine Empire , ruled most of the territory of present-day Turkey until the Late Middle Ages ; although the eastern regions remained firmly in Sasanian hands up to the first half of the seventh century . The frequent Byzantine-Sassanid Wars , as part of the centuries long-lasting Roman-Persian Wars , fought between the neighbouring rivalling Byzantines and Sasanians , took place in various parts of present-day Turkey and decided much of the latter 's history from the fourth century up to the first half of the seventh century .
Several ecumenical councils of the early Church were held in cities located in present-day Turkey including the First Council of Nicaea ( Iznik ) in 325 , the First Council of Constantinople ( Istanbul ) in 381 , the Council of Ephesus in 431 , and the Council of Chalcedon ( Kadky ) in 451.
===Seljuks and the Ottoman Empire===
The Seljuq dynasty originated from the Knk ( tribe ) branch of the Oghuz Turks who resided on the periphery of the Muslim history # Abbasids - `` Islamic Golden Age '' , in the Oghuz Yabgu State of the Ouz confederacy , to the north of the Caspian Sea and Aral Seas , in the 9th century . In the 10th century , the Seljuks started migrating from their ancestral homeland into Persia , which became the administrative core of the Seljuk Empire , after its foundation by Tughril .
In the latter half of the 11th century , the Seljuk Turks began penetrating into medieval Armenia and the eastern regions of Anatolia . In 1071 , the Seljuks defeated the Byzantines at the Battle of Manzikert , starting the Turkification process in the area ; the Turkish language and Islam were introduced to Armenia and Anatolia , gradually spreading throughout the region . The slow transition from a predominantly Christians and Greek language-speaking Anatolia to a predominantly Muslim and Turkish-speaking one was underway . The Mevlevi Order of dervishes , which was established in Konya during the 13th century by Sufi poet Celaleddin Rumi , played a significant role in the Islamization of the diverse people of Anatolia who had previously been Hellenized . Thus , alongside the Turkification of the territory , the Persianate society Seljuks set the basis for a Turko-Persian tradition Turko-Persian principal culture in Anatolia , which their eventual successors , Culture of the Ottoman Empire , would take over .
In 1243 , the Seljuk armies were defeated by the Mongol Empire at the Battle of Kse Da , causing the Seljuk Empire 's power to slowly disintegrate . In its wake , one of the Anatolian beyliks governed by Osman I would evolve over the next 200 years into the Ottoman Empire . The Ottomans completed their conquest of the Byzantine Empire by Fall of Constantinople capturing its capital , Constantinople , in 1453 : their commander thenceforth being known as Mehmed the Conqueror .
In 1514 , Sultan Selim I ( 15121520 ) successfully expanded the empire 's southern and eastern borders by defeating Shah Ismail I of the Safavid dynasty in the Battle of Chaldiran . In 1517 , Selim I expanded Ottoman rule into Ottoman Algeria and OttomanMamluk War ( 15161517 ) , and created a naval presence in the Red Sea . Subsequently , a contest started between the Ottoman and Portuguese Empire empires to become the dominant sea power in the Indian Ocean , with Ottoman naval expeditions in the Indian Ocean in the Red Sea , the Arabian Sea and the Persian Gulf . The Portuguese presence in the Indian Ocean was perceived as a threat to the Ottoman monopoly over the Silk Road between East Asia and Western Europe . Despite the increasingly prominent European presence , the Ottoman Empire 's trade with the east continued to flourish until the second half of the 18th century .
The Ottoman Empire 's power and prestige peaked in the 16th and 17th centuries , particularly during the reign of Suleiman the Magnificent , who personally instituted major legislative changes relating to society , education , taxation and criminal law . The empire was often at odds with the Holy Roman Empire in its steady advance towards Central Europe through the Balkans and the southern part of the PolishLithuanian Commonwealth . The Ottoman Navy contended with several Holy Leagues , such as those in Holy League ( 1538 ) , Holy League ( 1571 ) , Holy League ( 1684 ) and Holy League ( 1717 ) ( composed primarily of Habsburg Spain , the Republic of Genoa , the Republic of Venice , the Knights Hospitaller Knights of St. John , the Papal States , the Grand Duchy of Tuscany and the Duchy of Savoy ) , for the control of the Mediterranean Sea . In the east , the Ottomans were often at war with Safavid Persia over conflicts stemming from territorial disputes or religious differences between the 16th and 18th centuries . The Ottoman-Persian Wars continued as the Zand dynasty , Afsharid dynasty , and Qajar dynasty dynasties succeeded the Safavids in Iran , until the OttomanPersian War ( 18211823 ) . Even further east , there was an extension of the Habsburg-Ottoman conflict , in that the Ottomans also had to Ottoman expedition to Aceh to their farthest and easternmost vassal and territory , the Aceh Sultanate in Southeast Asia , to defend it from European colonizers as well as the Juan de Salcedo who had crossed from Latin America and had Christianized the formerly Muslim-dominated Islam in the Philippines . From the 16th to the early 20th centuries , the Ottoman Empire also Russo-Turkish Wars with the Tsardom of Russia and Russian Empire . These were initially about Ottoman territorial expansion and consolidation in southeastern and eastern Europe ; but starting from the Russo-Turkish War ( 17681774 ) , they became more about the survival of the Ottoman Empire , which had begun to lose its strategic territories on the northern Black Sea coast to the advancing Russians .
From the second half of the 18th century onwards , the Decline of the Ottoman Empire . The Tanzimat reforms , initiated by Mahmud II just before his death in 1839 , aimed to modernise the Ottoman state in line with the progress that had been made in Western Europe . The efforts of Midhat Pasha during the late Tanzimat era led the Ottoman Ottoman constitution of 1876 , which introduced the First Constitutional Era , but these efforts proved to be inadequate in most fields , and failed to stop the Dissolution of the Ottoman Empire . As the empire gradually shrank in size , military power and wealth ; especially after the Great Eastern Crisis in 1875 which led to uprisings in the Balkan provinces that culminated in the Russo-Turkish War ( 18771878 ) ; many Balkan Muslims migrated to the Empire 's heartland in Anatolia , along with the Circassians fleeing the RussianCircassian War of the Russian conquest of the Caucasus . The decline of the Ottoman Empire led to a Rise of nationalism under the Ottoman Empire , leading to increased ethnic tensions which occasionally burst into violence , such as the Hamidian massacres of Armenians .
The loss of Rumelia ( Ottoman territories in Europe ) with the First Balkan War ( 19121913 ) was followed by the arrival of millions of Muslim refugees ( muhacir ) to Istanbul and Anatolia . Historically , the Rumelia Eyalet and Anatolia Eyalet had formed the administrative divisions of the Ottoman Empire core of the Ottoman Empire , with their governors titled Beylerbeyi participating in the Sultan 's Imperial Council ( Ottoman Empire ) , so the loss of all Balkan provinces beyond the Kyky-Enez border line according to the London Conference of 191213 and the Treaty of London ( 1913 ) was a major shock for the Ottoman society and led to the 1913 Ottoman coup d'tat . In the Second Balkan War ( 1913 ) the Ottomans managed to recover their former capital Edirne ( Adrianople ) and its surrounding areas in East Thrace , which was formalised with the Treaty of Constantinople ( 1913 ) . The 1913 coup d'tat effectively put the country under the control of the Three Pashas , making sultans Mehmed V and Mehmed VI largely symbolic figureheads with no real political power .
The Ottoman Empire entered World War I on the side of the Central Powers and was ultimately defeated . The Ottomans successfully defended the Dardanelles strait during the Gallipoli campaign ( 19151916 ) and achieved initial victories against British forces in the first two years of the Mesopotamian campaign , such as the Siege of Kut ( 19151916 ) ; but the Arab Revolt ( 19161918 ) turned the tide against the Ottomans in the Middle East . In the Caucasus campaign , however , the Russian forces had the upper hand from the beginning , especially after the Battle of Sarikamish ( 19141915 ) . Russian forces advanced into northeastern Anatolia and controlled the major cities there until retreating from World War I with the Treaty of Brest-Litovsk following the Russian Revolution ( 1917 ) . During the war , the empire 's Armenians were Tehcir Law to Syria as part of the Armenian Genocide . As a result , an estimated 800,000 to 1,500,000 Armenians were killed . The Turkish government has Armenian Genocide denial the events as genocide and states that Armenians were only Population transfer from the eastern war zone . Genocidal campaigns were also committed against the empire 's other minority groups such as the Assyrian genocide and Greek genocide . Following the Armistice of Mudros on 30 October 1918 , the victorious Allies of World War I sought to partitioning of the Ottoman Empire through the 1920 Treaty of Svres .
===Republic of Turkey===
The occupation of Constantinople ( 1918 ) and Occupation of Smyrna ( 1919 ) by the Allies in the aftermath of World War I prompted the establishment of the Turkish National Movement . Under the leadership of Mustafa Kemal Atatrk Pasha , a military commander who had distinguished himself during the Battle of Gallipoli , the Turkish War of Independence ( 19191923 ) was waged with the aim of revoking the terms of the Treaty of Svres ( 1920 ) .
By 18 September 1922 the Greek , Armenian and French armies had been expelled , and the Turkish Provisional Government in Ankara , which had declared itself the legitimate government of the country on Grand National Assembly of Turkey , started to formalise the legal transition from the old Ottoman into the new Republican political system . On 1 November 1922 , the Turkish Parliament in Ankara formally Abolition of the Ottoman Sultanate , thus ending 623 years of monarchical Ottoman rule . The Treaty of Lausanne of 24 July 1923 , which superseded the Treaty of Svres , led to the international recognition of the sovereignty of the newly formed `` Republic of Turkey '' as the successor state of the Ottoman Empire , and the republic was officially proclaimed on 29 October 1923 in Ankara , the country 's new capital . The Convention Concerning the Exchange of Greek and Turkish Populations stipulated a population exchange between Greece and Turkey , whereby 1.1 ; million Greeks left Turkey for Greece in exchange for 380,000 Muslims transferred from Greece to Turkey .
Mustafa Kemal became the republic 's first President of Turkey and subsequently introduced Atatrk 's Reforms . The reforms aimed to transform the old Millet ( Ottoman Empire ) religion-based and multi-communal Ottoman constitutional monarchy into a Turkish nation state that would be governed as a parliamentary republic under a Turkish Constitution of 1924 . With the Surname Law of 1934 , the Turkish Parliament bestowed upon Mustafa Kemal the honorific surname `` Atatrk '' ( Father Turk ) .
The Montreux Convention Regarding the Regime of the Straits ( 1936 ) restored Turkey 's control over the Turkish Straits , including the right to militarise the coastlines of the Dardanelles and Bosporus straits and the Sea of Marmara , and to block maritime traffic in wartime .
Following the establishment of the Republic of Turkey in 1923 , some Kurds and Zazas tribes , which were feudalism ( manorialism ) communities led by tribal chief ( agha ( title ) ) during the Ottoman period , became discontent about certain aspects of Atatrk 's Reforms Atatrk 's reforms aiming to modernise the country , such as secularism ( the Sheikh Said rebellion , 1925 ) and land reform ( the Dersim rebellion , 19371938 ) , and staged armed revolts that were put down with military operations .
smet nn became Turkey 's second President following Atatrk 's death on 10 November 1938 . On 29 June 1939 , the Hatay State voted in favour of joining Turkey with a referendum . Turkey Second Cairo Conference during most of World War II , but entered the closing stages of the war on the side of the Allies of World War II on 23 February 1945 . On 26 June 1945 , Turkey became a United Nations Charter of the United Nations . In the following year , the One-party period of the Republic of Turkey single-party period in Turkey came to an end , with the 1946 Turkish general election .

After fighting as part of the United Nations forces in the Korean War , Turkey joined NATO in 1952 , becoming a bulwark against Soviet expansion into the Mediterranean Basin . Turkey subsequently became a founding member of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development in 1961 , and an Ankara Agreement of the European Economic Community in 1963.
The country 's tumultuous transition to Multi-party period of the Republic of Turkey was interrupted by military coup d'tat coups d'tat in 1960 Turkish coup d'tat and 1980 Turkish coup d'tat , as well as by military memorandums in 1971 Turkish coup d'tat and 1997 military memorandum ( Turkey ) . Between 1960 and the end of the 20th century , the prominent leaders in Turkish politics who achieved multiple election victories were Sleyman Demirel , Blent Ecevit and Turgut zal .
Following a decade of Cypriot intercommunal violence and the 1974 Cypriot coup d'tat staged by the EOKA B paramilitary organisation , which overthrew President Makarios III and installed the pro-Enosis ( union with Greece ) Nikos Sampson as dictator , Turkish invasion of Cyprus on 20 July 1974 by unilaterally exercising Article IV in the Treaty of Guarantee ( 1960 ) , but without restoring the status quo ante bellum at the end of the military operation . In 1983 the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus , which is recognised only by Turkey , was established . The Annan Plan for Cyprus for reunifying the island was supported by the majority of Turkish Cypriots , but rejected by the majority of Greek Cypriots , in separate 2004 Cypriot Annan Plan referendums . However , negotiations for solving the Cyprus dispute are still ongoing between Turkish Cypriot and Greek Cypriot political leaders .
The KurdishTurkish conflict ( 1978present ) between Turkey and the Kurdistan Workers ' Party ( designated a list of designated terrorist groups by Turkey , the United States , the European Union and North Atlantic Treaty Organization ) has been active since 1984 , primarily in the southeast of the country . More than 40,000 people have died as a result of the conflict . In 1999 PKK 's founder Abdullah calan was arrested and sentenced for terrorism and treason charges . In the past , various Kurdish people groups have unsuccessfully sought ethnic separatism from Turkey to create an independent Kurdistan , while others have more recently pursued provincial autonomy and greater Human rights of Kurdish people in Turkey for Kurds in Turkey . In the 21st century some reforms have taken place to improve the cultural rights of ethnic minorities in Turkey , such as the establishment of TRT Kurd , TRT Arabi and TRT Avaz by the Turkish Radio and Television Corporation .
Since the liberalisation of the Turkish economy in the 1980s , the country has enjoyed stronger economic growth and greater political stability .

In a non-binding vote on 13 March 2019 , the European Parliament called on the EU governments to suspend EU accession talks with Turkey , citing violations of human rights and the rule of law ; but the negotiations , effectively on hold since 2018 , remain active as of 2020.

Between 9 October  25 November 2019 , Turkey conducted a 2019 Turkish offensive into north-eastern Syria military offensive into north-eastern Syria .
==Administrative divisions==
Turkey has a unitary state structure in terms of administration and this aspect is one of the most important factors shaping the Turkish public administration . When three powers ( executive , legislative and judiciary ) are taken into account as the main functions of the state , local administrations have little power . Turkey does not have a federalism system , and the provinces are subordinate to the central government in Ankara . Local administrations were established to provide services in place and the government is represented by the province governors ( vali ) and town governors ( kaymakam ) . Other senior public officials are also appointed by the central government instead of the mayors ( belediye bakan ) or elected by constituents . Turkish municipalities have local legislative bodies ( belediye meclisi ) for decision-making on municipal issues .
Within this unitary framework , Turkey is subdivided into 81 Provinces of Turkey ( il or vilayet ) for administrative purposes . Each province is divided into Districts of Turkey ( ile ) , for a total of 973 districts . Turkey is also subdivided into 7 Geographical regions of Turkey ( blge ) and 21 subregions for geographic , demographic and economic purposes ; this does not refer to an administrative division .
==Politics==
Between 1923 and 2018 , Turkey was a parliamentary system representative democracy . A presidential system was adopted by 2017 Turkish constitutional referendum ; the new system came into effect with the 2018 Turkish presidential election and gives the President complete control of the executive ( government ) , including the power to issue decrees , appoint his own cabinet , draw up the budget , dissolve parliament by calling early elections , and make appointments to the bureaucracy and the courts . The office of Prime Minister of Turkey has been abolished and its powers ( together with those of the Cabinet of Turkey ) have been transferred to the President , who is the [ of state ] and is elected for a five-year term by direct elections . Recep Tayyip Erdoan is the first president elected by direct voting . Constitution of Turkey Turkey 's constitution governs the legal framework of the country . It sets out the main principles of government and establishes Turkey as a unitary centralised state .
Executive power is exercised by the President , while the legislature power is vested in the unicameral parliament , called the Grand National Assembly of Turkey . The judiciary is nominally independent from the executive and the legislature , but the constitutional changes that came into effect with the referendums in 2007 Turkish constitutional referendum , 2010 Turkish constitutional referendum and 2017 gave larger powers to the President and the ruling party for appointing or dismissing judges and prosecutors . The Constitutional Court of Turkey is charged with ruling on the conformity of Legal System in the Republic of Turkey with the constitution . The Turkish Council of State is the tribunal of last resort for administrative cases , and the High Court of Appeals of Turkey for all others .
Universal suffrage for both sexes has been applied throughout Turkey since 1933 and before most countries , and every Turkish citizen who has turned 18 years of age has the right to vote . There are 600 Member of Parliament who are elected for a four-year term by a party-list proportional representation system from 85 electoral districts .
The Constitutional Court can strip the public financing of List of political parties in Turkey that it deems secularism in Turkey anti-secular or separatism , or ban their existence altogether . The electoral threshold is ten percent of the votes .
Supporters of Atatrk 's reforms are called Kemalism , as distinguished from Islamism , representing the two diverging views regarding the role of religion in legislation , education and public life . The Kemalist view supports a form of democracy with a secular constitution and Western culture , while maintaining the necessity of state intervention in the economy , education and other public services . Since its foundation as a republic in 1923 , Turkey has developed a strong tradition of secular state . However , since the 1980s , issues such as income inequality and class distinction have given rise to Islamism , a movement that supports a larger role for religion in government policies , and in theory supports obligation to authority , communal solidarity and social justice ; though what that entails in practice is often contested . Turkey under Recep Tayyip Erdoan and the AKP has been described as becoming increasingly authoritarianism .
===Law===
Judicial system of Turkey Turkey 's judicial system has been wholly integrated with the Law in Europe . For instance , the Turkish civil code ( 1926 ) has been modified by incorporating elements mainly of the Swiss Civil Code and Swiss Code of Obligations , and the Law of Germany . The Administrative Code bears similarities with its Law of France , and the Penal Code with its Italian law codes .
Turkey has adopted the principle of the separation of powers . In line with this principle , judicial power is exercised by independent courts on behalf of the Turkish nation . The independence and organisation of the courts , the security of the tenure of judges and public prosecutors , the profession of judges and prosecutors , the supervision of judges and public prosecutors , the military courts and their organisation , and the powers and duties of the high courts are regulated by the Turkish Constitution .
According to Article 142 of the Turkish Constitution , the organisation , duties and jurisdiction of the courts , their functions and the trial procedures are regulated by law . In line with the aforementioned article of the Turkish Constitution and related laws , the court system in Turkey can be classified under three main categories ; which are the Judicial Courts , Administrative Courts and Military Courts . Each category includes first instance courts and high courts . In addition , the Court of Jurisdictional Disputes rules on cases that can not be classified readily as falling within the purview of one court system .
Law enforcement in Turkey is carried out by several departments ( such as the General Directorate of Security and Gendarmerie General Command ) and agencies , all acting under the command of the President of Turkey or mostly the Ministry of the Interior ( Turkey ) . According to figures released by the Ministry of Justice ( Turkey ) , there are 100,000 people in Turkish prisons as of November 2008 , a doubling since 2000.
In the years of government by the AKP and Erdoan , particularly since 2013 , the independence and integrity of the Turkish judiciary has increasingly been said to be in doubt by institutions , parliamentarians and journalists both within and outside of Turkey ; due to political interference in the promotion of judges and prosecutors , and in their pursuit of public duty . The Turkey 2015 report of the European Commission stated that `` the independence of the judiciary and respect of the principle of separation of powers have been undermined and judges and prosecutors have been under strong political pressure . ''
===Foreign relations===
Turkey is a founding member of the United Nations ( 1945 ) , the OECD ( 1961 ) , the Organisation of Islamic Cooperation ( 1969 ) , the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe ( 1973 ) , the Economic Cooperation Organization ( 1985 ) , the Organization of the Black Sea Economic Cooperation ( 1992 ) , the Developing 8 Countries D-8 ( 1997 ) and the G20 ( 1999 ) . Turkey was a member of the United Nations Security Council in 19511952 , 19541955 , 1961 and 20092010 . In 2012 Turkey became a dialogue partner of the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation , and in 2013 became a member of the Asia Cooperation Dialogue .
In line with its traditional Western orientation , relations with Europe have always been a central part of Turkish foreign policy . Turkey became Member states of the Council of Europe of the Council of Europe in 1950 , applied for associate membership of the EEC ( predecessor of the European Union ) in 1959 and became an associate member in 1963 . After decades of political negotiations , Turkey applied for full membership of the EEC in 1987 , became an associate member of the Western European Union in 1992 , joined the EU Customs Union in 1995 and has been in formal accession negotiations with the EU since 2005 . Turkey 's support for Northern Cyprus in the Cyprus dispute complicates Turkey 's relations with the EU and remains a major stumbling block to the country 's EU accession bid .
The other defining aspect of Turkey 's foreign policy was the country 's long-standing strategic alliance with the United States . The Truman Doctrine in 1947 enunciated American intentions to guarantee the security of Turkey and Greece during the Cold War , and resulted in large-scale Turkey-United States relations U.S. military and economic support . In 1948 both countries were included in the Marshall Plan and the Organisation for European Economic Co-operation for rebuilding European economies . The common threat posed by the Soviet Union during the Cold War led to Turkey 's membership of NATO in 1952 , ensuring close bilateral relations with the US . Subsequently , Turkey benefited from the United States ' political , economic and diplomatic support , including in key issues such as the country 's bid to join the European Union . In the postCold War environment , Turkey 's geostrategic importance shifted towards its proximity to the Middle East , the Caucasus and the Balkans .
The independence of the Turkic states of the Soviet Union in 1991 , with which Turkey shares a common cultural and linguistic heritage , allowed Turkey to extend its economic and political relations deep into Central Asia , thus enabling the completion of a multi-billion-dollar oil and natural gas pipeline transport from Baku in Azerbaijan to the port of Ceyhan in Turkey . The BakuTbilisiCeyhan pipeline forms part of Turkey 's foreign policy strategy to become an energy conduit from the Caspian Sea basin to Europe . However , in 1993 , Turkey sealed its land border with Armenia in a gesture of support to Azerbaijan ( a Turkic state in the Caucasus region ) during the First Nagorno-Karabakh War , and it remains closed .
Under the AKP government , Turkey 's influence has grown in the formerly Ottoman territories of the Middle East and the Balkans , based on the `` strategic depth '' doctrine ( a terminology that was coined by Ahmet Davutolu for defining Turkey 's increased engagement in regional foreign policy issues ) , also called Neo-Ottomanism . Following the Arab Spring in December 2010 , the choices made by the AKP government for supporting certain political opposition groups in the affected countries have led to tensions with some Arab states , such as Turkey 's neighbour Syria since the start of the Syrian civil war , and Egypt after the 2013 Egyptian coup d'tat . , Turkey does not have an ambassador in either Syria or Egypt . Diplomatic relations with Israel were also severed after the Gaza flotilla raid in 2010 , but were normalised following a deal in June 2016 . These political rifts have left Turkey with few allies in the Levant , where rich natural gas fields have recently been discovered ; in sharp contrast with the original goals that were set by the former Foreign Minister ( later Prime Minister ) Ahmet Davutolu in his `` zero problems with neighbours '' foreign policy doctrine . In 2015 , Turkey , Saudi Arabia and Qatar formed a `` strategic alliance '' against Syrian President Bashar al-Assad . However , following the RussiaTurkey relations # Normalisation of ties in 2016 , Turkey revised its stance regarding the solution of the conflict in Syria . In January 2018 , the Turkish military and the Turkish-backed forces , including the Turkish-backed Free Syrian Army and Ahrar al-Sham , began an Turkish military operation in Afrin aimed at ousting U.S.-backed People 's Protection Units from the enclave of Afrin , Syria . In 2020 , Turkey openly Turkish military intervention in the Second Libyan Civil War at the request of the Government of National Accord . There is a dispute over Turkey 's Aegean dispute and CyprusTurkey maritime zones dispute and drilling rights in the eastern Mediterranean . Turkey recognizes and supports the Tripoli-based Government of National Accord ( GNA ) in Libya , which has been torn by a Libyan Civil War ( 2014present ) since 2014.

Between 1959 and 2011 the European Court of Human Rights made more than 2400 judgements against Turkey for human rights violations on issues such as Human rights of Kurdish people in Turkey , women in Turkey women 's rights , LGBT rights in Turkey , and media of Turkey . Turkey 's human rights record continues to be a significant obstacle to the country 's Accession of Turkey to the European Union .
In the latter half of the 1970s , Turkey suffered from political violence in Turkey ( 19761980 ) between far-left politics far-left and far-right politics far-right militant groups , which culminated in the 1980 Turkish coup d'tat . The Kurdistan Workers ' Party ( designated a list of designated terrorist groups by Turkey , the United States , the European Union and North Atlantic Treaty Organization ) was founded in 1978 by a group of Kurdish militants led by Abdullah calan , seeking the foundation of an independent , socialist state Marxist-Leninist state in the region , which was to be known as Kurdistan . The initial reason given by the PKK for this was the oppression of Kurds in Turkey . KurdishTurkish conflict ( 1978present ) A full-scale insurgency began in 1984 , when the PKK announced a Kurdish uprising . Following the arrest and imprisonment of Abdullah calan in 1999 , the PKK modified its demands into equal rights for ethnic Kurds and provincial autonomy within Turkey . Since the conflict began , more than 40,000 people have died , most of whom were Turkish Kurds . The European Court of Human Rights and other international human rights organisations have condemned Turkey for human rights abuses .

On 20 May 2016 , the Turkish parliament stripped almost a quarter of its members of Parliamentary immunity from prosecution , including 101 deputies from the pro-Kurdish Peoples ' Democratic Party ( Turkey ) and the main opposition Republican People 's Party ( Turkey ) party .

According to the Committee to Protect Journalists , the Justice and Development Party ( Turkey ) government has waged one of the world 's biggest crackdowns on media freedom in Turkey . Many journalists have been arrested using charges of `` terrorism '' and `` anti-state activities '' such as the Ergenekon ( organization ) and Sledgehammer ( coup plan ) cases , while thousands have been investigated on charges such as `` denigrating Turkishness '' or `` insulting Islam '' in an effort to sow self-censorship .

Many natural gas pipelines span the country 's territory . The Baku-Tbilisi-Ceyhan pipeline , the second longest oil pipeline in the world , was inaugurated in 2005 . The Blue Stream , a major trans-Black Sea gas pipeline , delivers natural gas from Russia to Turkey . The undersea pipeline , Turkish Stream , with an annual capacity around , allows Turkey to resell Russian gas to the rest of Europe .
Turkey consumes 1700 terawatt hours ( TW/h ) of primary energy per year , a little over 20 megawatt hours ( MW/h ) per person , mostly from imported fossil fuels . Although the energy policy of Turkey includes reducing fossil-fuel imports , coal in Turkey is the largest single reason why greenhouse gas emissions by Turkey amount to 1 % of the global total . Renewable energy in Turkey is being increased and Akkuyu Nuclear Power Plant is being built on the Mediterranean Sea coast : but despite Electricity sector in Turkey overcapacity Fossil fuel subsidies . Turkey has the fifth-highest direct utilisation and capacity of Geothermal power in Turkey in the world .

== Demographics ==
According to the Address-Based Population Recording System of Turkey , the country 's population was 74.7 ; million people in 2011 , nearly three-quarters of whom lived in urban area . According to the 2011 estimate , the population is increasing by 1.35 percent each year . Turkey has an average population density of 97 people per km . People within the 1564 age group constitute 67.4 percent of the total population ; the 014 age group corresponds to 25.3 percent ; while senior citizens aged 65 years or older make up 7.3 percent .
Article 66 of the Turkish Constitution defines a `` Turk '' as `` anyone who is bound to the Turkish state through the bond of citizenship '' ; therefore , the legal use of the term `` Turkish '' as a citizenship of Turkey is different from the ethnic group definition . However approximately 70 to 80 percent of the country 's citizens are ethnic Turks . It is estimated that there are at least 47 ethnic groups represented in Turkey . Reliable data on the ethnic mix of the population is not available , because Turkish census figures do not include statistics on ethnicity .
Kurds in Turkey are the largest non-Turkish ethnicity at anywhere from 12-25 per cent of the population . The exact figure remains a subject of dispute ; according to Servet Mutlu , `` more often than not , these estimates reflect pro-Kurdish or pro-Turkish sympathies and attitudes rather than scientific facts or erudition '' . Mutlu 's 1990 study estimated Kurds made up around 12 per cent of the population , while Mehrdad Izady placed the figure around 25 per cent . The Kurds are making up a majority in the provinces of Ar Province , Batman Province , Bingl Province , Bitlis Province , Diyarbakr Province , Elz Province , Hakkari Province , Idr Province , Mardin Province , Mu Province , Siirt Province , rnak Province , Tunceli Province and Van Province ; a near majority in anlurfa Province ( 47 % ) ; and a large minority in Kars Province ( 20 % ) . In addition , due to internal migration , Kurdish diaspora communities exist in all of the major cities in central and western Turkey . In Istanbul , there are an estimated three million Kurds , making it the city with the largest Kurdish population in the world . Non-Kurdish minorities are believed to make up an estimated 712 percent of the population .
The three `` Millet ( Ottoman Empire ) Non-Muslim '' minority groups recognised in the Treaty of Lausanne were Armenians in Turkey , Greeks in Turkey and Jews in Turkey . Other ethnic groups include Albanians in Turkey , Arabs in Turkey , Assyrians in Turkey , Bosniaks in Turkey , Circassians in Turkey , Georgians in Turkey , Laz people , Pomaks , and Romani people . Turkey is also home to a Muslim community of Megleno-Romanians .
Before the start of the Syrian civil war in 2011 , the estimated number of Arabs in Turkey varied from 1 million to more than 2 million . As of April 2020 , there are 3.6 million Refugees of the Syrian Civil War in Turkey in Turkey , who are mostly Arabs but also include Syrian Kurds , Syrian Turkmen , and other ethnic groups of Syria . The vast majority of these are living in Turkey with temporary residence permits . The Turkish government has granted Turkish citizenship to refugees who have joined the Syrian National Army .
=== Immigration ===
Immigration to Turkey is the process by which people [ migration migrate ] to Turkey to reside in the country . Turkey 's migrant crisis created after an estimated 2.5 percent of the population are [ migration international migrants ] . Turkey hosts the largest number of refugees in the world , including 3.6 million Refugees of the Syrian Civil War in Turkey , as of April 2020 . As part of Turkey 's migrant crisis , according to UNHCR , in 2018 Turkey was hosting 63.4 % of all the refugees in the world , that is 3,564,919 registered refugees from Africa and the Middle East in total .
===Languages===
The official language is Turkish language , which is the most widely spoken Turkic languages in the world . It is spoken by 85.54 percent of the population as a first language . 11.97 percent of the population speaks the Kurmanji dialect of Kurdish languages as their mother tongue . Arabic language and Zaza language are the mother tongues of 2.39 percent of the population , and several other languages are the mother tongues of smaller parts of the population .

Megleno-Romanian language Megleno-Romanian is also spoken .
===Religion===
Turkey is a secular state with no official state religion ; the Turkish Constitution provides for freedom of religion and conscience . A 2016 survey by Ipsos , interviewing 17,180 adults across 22 countries , found that Islam was the dominant religion in Turkey , adhered to by 82 % of the total population ; religiously unaffiliated people comprised 13 % of the population , while 2 % were Christianity . The CIA World Factbook reports that Islam is the religion of 99.8 % of the population , with Sunni Muslims as the largest sect , while 0.2 % are Christians and Jews . However , there are no official governmental statistics specifying the religious beliefs of the Turkish people , nor is religious data recorded in the country 's census . Academics suggest the Alevi population may be from 15 to 20 million , while the Alevi-Bektai Federation states that there are around 25 ; million . According to Aksiyon magazine , the number of Twelver Shia Islam ( excluding Alevis ) is three million ( 4.2 % ) .
Christianity has a long history in present-day Turkey , which is the birthplace of numerous Christian Twelve apostles and saints . Antioch ( Antakya ) is regarded by tradition as the spot where the Gospels were written , and where the followers of Jesus were called Christians for the first time . The percentage of Christians in Turkey fell from 17.5 % ( three million followers ) in a population of 16 ; million to 2.5 % percent in the early 20th century . mainly as a result of the Armenian Genocide , the population exchange between Greece and Turkey , and the Christian emigration that began in the late 19th century and gained pace in the first quarter of the 20th century . Today , there are more than 120,000-320,000 people of various Christian denominations , representing less than 0.2 % of Turkey 's population , including an estimated 80,000 Oriental Orthodox , 35,000 Catholic Church , 18,000 Antiochian Greeks , 5,000 Greek Orthodox Church and smaller numbers of Protestantism . Currently there are 236 churches open for worship in Turkey .
Modern-day Turkey continues to have a small Jewish population ; with around 26,000 History of the Jews in Turkey , the vast majority of whom are Sephardi .
In a mid-2010s poll , 2.9 % of Turkish respondents identified as atheists . The Ateizm Dernei , the first official atheist organisation in the Balkans and the Middle East , was founded in 2014 . Some religious and secular officials have claimed that atheism and deism are growing among Turkish people .
===Education===
The Ministry of National Education ( Turkey ) is responsible for pre-tertiary education . This is compulsory and lasts twelve years : four years each of primary school , middle school and high school . Basic education in Turkey is said to lag behind other OECD countries , with significant differences between high and low performers . Access to high-quality school heavily depends on the performance in the secondary school entrance exams , to the point that some students begin taking private tutoring classes when they are ten years old .
As of 2017 , there are 190 universities in Turkey . Except for the Open Education Faculties ( AF ) at Anadolu University , Istanbul University and Atatrk University ; entrance is regulated by the national Student Selection and Placement System ( SYS ) examination , after which high school graduates are assigned to universities according to their performance . According to the 20122013 Times Higher Education World University Rankings , the top university in Turkey is Middle East Technical University , followed by Bilkent University and Ko University , Istanbul Technical University and Boazii University . All state and private universities are under the control of the Council of Higher Education ( Turkey ) ( YK ) , whose head is appointed by the President of Turkey ; and since 2016 the President directly appoints all rectors of all state and private universities .
===Health===
The Ministry of Health ( Turkey ) has run a universal public healthcare system since 2003 . Known as Universal Health Insurance Genel Salk Sigortas , it is funded by a tax surcharge on employers , currently at 5 % . Public-sector funding covers approximately 75.2 % of health expenditures .
Despite the universal health care , total expenditure on health as a share of GDP in 2018 was the lowest among OECD countries at 6.3 % of GDP , compared to the OECD average of 9.3 % .
Average life expectancy is 78.6 years ( 75.9 for males and 81.3 for females ) , compared with the EU average of 81 years . Turkey has one of the highest rates of obesity in the world , with nearly one third ( 29.5 % ) of its adult population obese . Air pollution in Turkey is a major cause of early death .
==Culture==
Turkey has a very diverse culture that is a blend of various elements of the Turkic peoples , Anatolian , Culture of the Ottoman Empire ( which was itself a continuation of both Greco-Roman and Islamic culture cultures ) and Western culture and traditions , which started with the Tanzimat and still continues today . This mix originally began as a result of the encounter of Turks and their culture with those of the peoples who were in their path during Turkic migration from Central Asia to the West . Turkish culture is a product of efforts to be a `` modern '' Western state , while maintaining traditional religious and historical values .
===Visual arts===
List of Turkish painters , in the Western sense , developed actively starting from the mid 19th century . The first painting lessons were scheduled at what is now the Istanbul Technical University ( then the Imperial Military Engineering School ) in 1793 , mostly for technical purposes . In the late 19th century , human figure in the Western sense was being established in Turkish painting , especially with Osman Hamdi Bey . Impressionism , among the contemporary trends , appeared later on with Halil Pasha ( painter ) . The young Turkish artists sent to Europe in 1926 came back inspired by contemporary trends such as Fauvism , Cubism and even Expressionism , still very influential in Europe . The later `` Group D '' of artists led by Abidin Dino , Cemal Tollu , Fikret Mualla , Princess Fahrelnissa Zeid , Bedri Rahmi Eyuboglu , Adnan Coker and Burhan Doanay introduced some trends that had lasted in the West for more than three decades . Other important movements in Turkish painting were the `` Yeniler Grubu '' ( The Newcomers Group ) of the late 1930s ; the `` On'lar Grubu '' ( Group of Ten ) of the 1940s ; the `` Yeni Dal Grubu '' ( New Branch Group ) of the 1950s ; and the `` Siyah Kalem Grubu '' ( Black Pen Group ) of the 1960s .
Turkish carpet is a traditional art from pre-Islamic times . During its long history , the art and craft of the woven carpet has integrated different cultural traditions . Traces of Byzantine design can be detected ; Turkic peoples migrating from Central Asia , as well as Armenian people , Caucasian and Kurdish tribes either living in , or migrating to Anatolia , brought with them their traditional designs . The arrival of Islam and the development of Islamic art also influenced Turkish carpet design . The history of its designs , motifs and ornaments thus reflects the political and ethnic history and diversity of Asia minor . However , scientific attempts were unsuccessful , as yet , to attribute a particular design to a specific ethnic , regional , or even nomadic versus village tradition .
Ottoman miniature is linked to the Persian miniature tradition , as well as strong Chinese artistic influences . The words tasvir or nak were used to define the art of miniature painting in Ottoman Turkish . The studios the artists worked in were called nakkahane . The miniatures were usually not signed , perhaps because of the rejection of individualism , but also because the works were not created entirely by one person ; the head painter designed the composition of the scene , and his apprentices drew the contours ( which were called tahrir ) with black or colored ink and then painted the miniature without creating an illusion of depth . The head painter , and much more often the scribe of the text , were indeed named and depicted in some of the manuscripts . The understanding of perspective was different from that of the nearby European Renaissance painting tradition , and the scene depicted often included different time periods and spaces in one picture . They followed closely the context of the book they were included in , more illustrations than standalone works of art .
The earliest examples of Turkish paper marbling , called ebru in Turkish , are said to be a copy of the Hlnme by the poet Arif . The text of this manuscript was rendered in a delicate cut paper dcoupage calligraphy by Mehmed bin Gazanfer and completed in 1540 , and features many marbled and decorative paper borders . One early master by the pseudonym of ebek is mentioned posthumously in the earliest Ottoman text on the art known as the Tertib-i Risle-i Ebr , which is dated based on internal evidence to after 1615 . The instructions for several ebru techniques in the text are accredited to this master . Another famous 18th-century master by the name of Hatip Mehmed Efendi ( died 1773 ) is accredited with developing motifs and perhaps early floral designs , although evidence from India appears to contradict some of these reports . Despite this , marbled motifs are commonly referred to as hatip designs in Turkey today .
===Literature and theatre===
Turkish literature is a mix of cultural influences . Interaction between the Ottoman Empire and the Islamic world along with Europe contributed to a blend of Turkic , Islamic and European traditions in modern-day Turkish music and literary arts . Turkish literature was heavily influenced by Persian literature and Arabic literature during most of the Ottoman era . The Tanzimat reforms introduced previously unknown Western genres , primarily the novel and the short story . Many of the writers in the Tanzimat period wrote in several genres simultaneously : for instance , the poet Namik Kemal also wrote the important 1876 novel ntibh ( Awakening ) , while the journalist brahim inasi has written , in 1860 , the first modern Turkish play , the One act play one-act comedy `` air Evlenmesi '' ( The Poet 's Marriage ) . Most of the roots of modern Turkish literature were formed between the years 1896 and 1923 . Broadly , there were three primary literary movements during this period : the Edebiyat- Cedde ( New Literature ) movement ; the Fecr-i t ( Dawn of the Future ) movement ; and the Mill Edebiyat ( National Literature ) movement . The first radical step of innovation in 20th century Turkish poetry was taken by Nzm Hikmet Ran , who introduced the free verse style . Another revolution in Turkish poetry came about in 1941 with the Garip movement led by Orhan Veli Kank , Oktay Rfat Horozcu and Melih Cevdet Anday . The mix of cultural influences in Turkey is dramatised , for example , in the form of the `` new symbols of the clash and interlacing of cultures '' enacted in the novels of Orhan Pamuk , recipient of the 2006 Nobel Prize in Literature .
The origin of Turkish theatre dates back to ancient pagan rituals and oral legends . The dances , music and songs performed during the rituals of the inhabitants of Anatolia millennia ago are the elements from which the first shows originated . In time , the ancient rituals , myths , legends and stories evolved into theatrical shows . Starting from the 11th-century , the traditions of the Seljuk Turks blended with those of the indigenous peoples of Anatolia and the interaction between diverse cultures paved the way for new plays . After the Tanzimat ( Reformation ) period in the 19th century , characters in Turkish theatre were modernised and plays were performed on European-style stages , with actors wearing European costumes . Following the Second Constitutional Era with the Young Turk Revolution in 1908 , theatrical activities increased and social problems began to be reflected at the theatre as well as in historical plays . A theatrical conservatoire , Darlbedayi Darlbedayi-i Osmani ( which became the nucleus of the Istanbul City Theatres ) was established in 1914 . During the years of chaos and war , the Darlbedayi-i Osmani continued its activities and attracted the younger generation . Numerous Turkish playwrights emerged in this era ; some of them wrote on romantic subjects , while others were interested in social problems , and still others dealt with nationalistic themes . The first Turkish musicals were also written in this period . In time , Turkish women began to appear on stage , which was an important development in the late Ottoman society . Until then , female roles had only been played by actresses who were members of Turkey 's ethnic minorities . Today there are numerous private theatres in the country , together with those which are subsidised by the government , such as the Turkish State Theatres .
Notable players , directors and playwrights of Turkish theatre include Muhsin Erturul , Haldun Taner , Aziz Nesin , Glriz Sururi , Yldz Kenter , Mfik Kenter , Haldun Dormen , Sadri Alk , olpan lhan , Mnir zkul , Adile Nait , Erol Gnaydn , Gazanfer zcan , Nejat Uygur , Genco Erkal , Metin Serezli , Nevra Serezli , Levent Krca , Zeki Alasya , Metin Akpnar , Mjdat Gezen , Ferhan ensoy , among others .
===Music and dance===
Music of Turkey includes mainly Turkic culture elements as well as partial influences ranging from Music of Central Asia , Arabic music , Greek music , Ottoman music , Persian traditional music and Music of Southeastern Europe , as well as references to more modern European and Music of the United States popular music . The roots of traditional music in Turkey span across centuries to a time when the Seljuk Turks migrated to Anatolia and Persia in the 11th century and contains elements of both Turkic and pre-Turkic influences . Much of its modern popular music can trace its roots to the emergence in the early 1930s drive for Westernization .
With the assimilation of immigrants from various regions the diversity of musical genres and musical instrumentation also expanded . Turkey has also seen documented folk music and recorded popular music produced in the ethnic styles of Music of Greece , Music of Armenia , Music of Albania , Music of Poland and Jewish communities , among others .
Many Turkish cities and towns have vibrant local music scenes which , in turn , support a number of regional musical styles . Despite this however , western music styles like pop music and Kanto ( music ) lost popularity to arabesque in the late 1970s and 1980s . It became popular again by the beginning of the 1990s , as a result of an opening economy and society . With the support of Sezen Aksu , the resurging popularity of pop music gave rise to several international Turkish pop stars such as Tarkan ( singer ) and Sertab Erener . The late 1990s also saw an emergence of underground music producing alternative Turkish rock music , electronica , Turkish hip hop hip-hop , Hip hop music and dance music in opposition to the mainstream corporate pop music and Arabesque music genres , which many believe have become too commercial . Internationally acclaimed Turkish jazz and blues musicians and composers include Ahmet Ertegun ( founder and president of Atlantic Records ) , Nkhet Ruacan and Kerem Grsev .
The Turkish Five is a name used by some authors to identify the five pioneers of Western classical music in Turkey , namely Ahmed Adnan Saygun , Ulvi Cemal Erkin , Cemal Reit Rey , Hasan Ferit Alnar and Necil Kazm Akses . Internationally acclaimed Turkish musicians of Western classical music include pianists dil Biret , Verda Erman , Glsin Onay , the Pekinel sisters ( Gher and Sher Pekinel ) , Ayegl Sarca and Fazl Say ; violinists Ayla Erduran and Suna Kan ; opera singers Semiha Berksoy , Leyla Gencer and Gne Grle ; and conductors Emre Arac , Grer Aykal , Erol Erdin , Rengim Gkmen and Hikmet imek .
Turkish dance is diverse . Hora ( dance ) is performed in East Thrace ; Zeybek dance in the Aegean Region , Marmara Region and Central Anatolia Region East-Central Anatolia Region ; Teke in the Mediterranean Region ; Kak Oyunlar and Karlama in Central Anatolia Region West-Central Anatolia , Black Sea Region , Marmara Region and Mediterranean Region ; Horon in the Black Sea Region ; Halay in Eastern Anatolia Region and the Central Anatolia Region ; and Bar ( dance ) and Lezginka in the Eastern Anatolia Region .
===Architecture===
The Seljuk architecture combined the elements and characteristics of the Architecture of Central Asia with those of Persian architecture , Arab architecture , Armenian architecture and Byzantine architecture architecture . The transition from Seljuk architecture to Ottoman architecture is most visible in Bursa , which was the capital of the Ottoman Empire between 1335 and 1413 . Following the Fall of Constantinople Ottoman conquest of Constantinople ( Istanbul ) in 1453 , Ottoman architecture was significantly influenced by Byzantine architecture . Topkap Palace in Istanbul is one of the most famous examples of classical Ottoman architecture and was the primary residence of the Ottoman Sultans for approximately 400 years . Mimar Sinan ( c.14891588 ) was the most important architect of the classical period in Ottoman architecture . He was the chief architect of at least 374 buildings which were constructed in various eyalet of the Ottoman Empire in the 16th century .
Since the 18th century , Turkish architecture has been increasingly influenced by European styles , and this can be particularly seen in the Tanzimat era buildings of Istanbul like the Dolmabahe Palace , raan Palace , Feriye Saraylar , Beylerbeyi Palace , Kksu Palace , Ihlamur Palace and Yldz Palace palaces , which were all designed by members of the Balyan family of Ottoman Armenian court architects . The Ottoman era yal waterfront houses ( yal ) on the Bosphorus also reflect the fusion between classical Ottoman and European architectural styles during the aforementioned period .
The First National Architectural Movement in the early 20th century sought to create a new architecture , which was based on motifs from Seljuk and Ottoman architecture . The leading architects of this movement were Vedat Tek ( 18731942 ) , Mimar Kemaleddin Bey ( 18701927 ) , Arif Hikmet Koyunolu ( 18881982 ) and Giulio Mongeri ( 18731953 ) . Buildings from this era are the Istanbul Main Post Office in Istanbul ( 19051909 ) , Tayyare Apartments ( 19191922 ) , Istanbul 4th Vakf Han ( 19111926 ) , State Art and Sculpture Museum ( 19271930 ) , Ethnography Museum of Ankara ( 19251928 ) , the first Ziraat Bank headquarters in Ankara ( 19251929 ) , the first Trkiye  Bankas headquarters in Ankara ( 19261929 ) , Bebek , Istanbul Mosque , and Kamer Hatun Mosque .
===Cuisine===
Turkish cuisine is largely the heritage of Ottoman cuisine . In the early years of the Republic , a few studies were published about regional Anatolian dishes but cuisine did not feature heavily in Turkish folkloric studies until the 1980s , when the fledgling tourism industry encouraged the Turkish state to sponsor two food symposia . The papers submitted at the symposia presented the history of Turkish cuisine on a `` historical continuum '' that dated back to Turkic origins in Central Asia and continued through the Seljuk and Ottoman periods .
Many of the papers presented at these first two symposia were unreferenced . Prior to the symposia , the study of Turkish culinary culture was first popularised by the publication of Sheyl nver 's Fifty Dishes in Turkish History in 1948 . This book was based on recipes found in an 18th century Ottoman manuscript . His second book was about palace cuisine during the reign of Mehmet II . Following the publication of nver 's book subsequent studies were published , including a 1978 study by a historian named Bahaettin gel about the Central Asian cuisine origins of Turkish cuisine .
Ottoman cuisine contains elements of Turkish cuisine , Byzantine cuisine , Balkan cuisine , Armenian cuisine , Kurdish cuisine , Arab cuisine and Persian cuisine cuisines . The country 's position between Europe , Asia , and the Mediterranean Sea helped the Turks in gaining complete control of the major trade routes , and an ideal landscape and climate allowed plants and animals to flourish . Turkish cuisine was well established by the mid-1400s , the beginning of the Ottoman Empire 's six hundred-year reign . Yogurt salads , fish in olive oil , sharbat and dolma became Turkish staples . The empire , eventually spanning from Austria and Ukraine to Arabia and North Africa , used its land and water routes to import exotic ingredients from all over the world . By the end of the 16th century , the Ottoman court housed over 1,400 live-in cooks and passed laws regulating the freshness of food . Since the fall of the empire in World War I ( 19141918 ) and the establishment of the Turkish Republic in 1923 , foreign food such as French hollandaise sauce and Western fast food have made their way into the modern Turkish diet .

Despite legal provisions , media freedom in Turkey has steadily deteriorated from 2010 onwards , with a precipitous decline following the failed 2016 Turkish coup d'tat attempt on 15 July 2016 . As of December 2016 , at least 81 List of arrested journalists in Turkey in Turkey and more than 100 news outlets were closed . Freedom House lists Turkey 's media freedom in Turkey as Freedom of the Press ( report ) . The media crackdowns also extend to Internet censorship with 2017 block of Wikipedia in Turkey between 29 April 2017 and 15 January 2020.

Finland ( Suomi ; Finland , ) , officially the Republic of Finland ( Suomen tasavalta , Republiken Finland ) , is a Nordic country located in Northern Europe . Finland shares land borders with Sweden to the west , Russia to the east , and Norway to the north and is defined by the Gulf of Bothnia to the west and the Gulf of Finland to the south that are part of the Baltic Sea .
Finland has a population of approximately 5.5 million , making it the List of European countries by population 25th-most populous country in Europe . The main language is Finnish language , a Finnic languages of the Uralic languages language family . Swedish language is the second Finland Swedish , and is mainly spoken in certain coastal areas of the country and on land Islands . Finland is a parliamentary republic consisting of 19 Regions of Finland and 310 Municipalities of Finland . The climate varies significantly relative to latitude , from Southern Finland 's [ continental climate ] to the boreal climate of the north . Finland is primarily a boreal forest biome , with more than 180,000 recorded List of lakes of Finland , leading to the denomination `` the land of a thousand lakes '' . With an area of , Finland is the Area and population of European countries eighth-largest country in Europe , and the most List of countries and territories by population density country in the European Union . Helsinki , the capital of Finland , is the largest metropolitan area with over 1.5 million people , which produces a third of the country 's Gross domestic product . Tampere and Turku are the next largest urban areas .
Finland was inhabited around 9000 ; BC after Last glacial period . The Stone Age introduced several different ceramic styles and cultures . The Bronze Age and Iron Age were characterised by extensive contacts with other cultures in Fennoscandia and the Baltic region . From the late 13th century , Finland gradually became an integral part of Sweden as a consequence of the Northern Crusades , the legacy of which is reflected in the prevalence of the Swedish language and its official status . In 1809 , as a result of the Finnish War , Finland was annexed by the Russian Empire as the autonomous Grand Duchy of Finland , during which Golden Age of Finnish Art and the idea of Independence of Finland began to take hold . In 1906 , Finland became the first European state to Universal suffrage # Dates by country , and the first in the world to give all adult citizens the right to run for public office . Nicholas II of Russia , the last Tsar of Russian Empire , tried to Russification of Finland and also terminate its political autonomy , but after the 1917 Russian Revolution , Finland Finnish Declaration of Independence . In 1918 , the fledgling state was divided by the Finnish Civil War . During World War II , Finland fought the Soviet Union in the Winter War and the Continuation War , and Nazi Germany in the Lapland War . After the wars , Finland lost part of its territory , but maintained its independence .
Finland largely remained an Agriculture country until the 1950s . After World War II , the country rapidly industrialised and developed an advanced economy , while building an extensive welfare state based on the Nordic model , resulting in widespread prosperity and a high List of countries by GDP ( nominal ) per capita . Finland joined the United Nations in 1955 and adopted an official policy of neutrality . Finland joined the OECD in 1969 , the Partnership for Peace in 1994 , the European Union in 1995 , the Euro-Atlantic Partnership Council in 1997 , and the Eurozone at its inception in 1999.
Finland is a top performer in numerous International rankings of Finland , including education , economic competitiveness , civil liberties , quality of life and human development . In 2015 , Finland was ranked first in the World Human Capital and the Press Freedom Index and as the most stable country in the world during 20112016 in the Fragile States Index , and second in the Global Gender Gap Report . It also ranked first on the World Happiness Report report for 2018 , 2019 and 2020.
== Etymology ==
=== Finland ===
The earliest written appearance of the name Finland is thought to be on three runestones . Two were found in the Swedish province of Uppland and have the inscription finlonti ( Runestone U 582 ) . The third was found in Gotland . It has the inscription finlandi ( Runestone G 319 ) and dates back to the 13th century . The name can be assumed to be related to the tribe name Finnish tribes , which is mentioned at first known time AD 98 ( disputed meaning ) .
=== Suomi ===
The name Suomi ( ) has uncertain origins , but a common etymology with saame ( Sami people , a Finno-Ugric people in Lapland ( Finland ) ) and Tavastia ( historical province ) ( a province in the inland ) has been suggested ( Proto-Finnic wikt : Reconstruction : Proto-Finnic/hm * hm from older * m , possibly loaned into Proto-Saami as wikt : Reconstruction : Proto-Samic/sm * sm ) , whose source could be the Proto-Baltic word wikt : Reconstruction : Proto-Balto-Slavic/em * em , meaning ' ( low ) land ' . According to the hypothesis , * sm  or * m directly  was loaned back into Baltic as * sma- ( compare Latvian sms 'Finn , Saaremaa ' ) , from which Northern Finnic reborrowed it ( perhaps via a Germanic intermediate * sma- ) as * sma- * sme- 'Finland ' . In addition to the close relatives of Finnish ( the Finnic languages ) , this name is also used in the Baltic languages Latvian language ( soms , Somija ) and Lithuanian language ( suomis , Suomija ) , although these are evidently later borrowings . An alternative hypothesis by Petri Kallio suggests the Proto-Indo-European word wikt : Reconstruction : Proto-Indo-European/m * ( d ) m-on- 'human ' ( cf . Gothic guma , Latin homo ) , being borrowed into Uralic as * oma .
Earlier theories suggested derivation from suomaa ( fen land ) or suoniemi ( fen cape ) , but these are now considered outdated .
It has been suggested that the Finnish word Suomi is first attested the Royal Frankish Annals annal for 811 , which mentions a person called Suomi among the Danish delegation at a peace treaty with the Franks . If so , it is also the earliest evidence for the change from the proto-Finnic monophthong to the Finnish diphthong . However , some historical linguists view this interpretation of the name as unlikely , supposing another etymology or that the spelling originated as a scribal error ( in which case the sound-change could have happened much later ) .
=== Concept ===
In the earliest historical sources , from the 12th and 13th centuries , the term Finland refers to the coastal region around Turku from Perni to Uusikaupunki . This region later became known as Southwest Finland in distinction from the country name Finland . Finland became a common name for the whole country in a centuries-long process that started when the Catholic Church established a missionary diocese in Nousiainen in the northern part of the province of Suomi possibly sometime in the 12th century .
The devastation of Finland during the Great Northern War ( 17141721 ) and during the Russo-Swedish War ( 17411743 ) caused Sweden to begin carrying out major efforts to defend its eastern half from Russia . These 18th-century experiences created a sense of a shared destiny that when put in conjunction with the unique Finnish language , led to the adoption of an expanded concept of Finland .
== History ==
===Prehistory===
If the Archaeology finds from Wolf Cave are the result of Neanderthal Neanderthals ' activities , the first people inhabited Finland approximately 120,000130,000 years ago . The area that is now Finland was settled in , at the latest , around 8,500 BC during the Stone Age towards the end of the last glacial period . The Artifact ( archaeology ) the first settlers left behind present characteristics that are shared with those found in Estonia , Russia , and Norway . The earliest people were [ using stone tools .
The first pottery appeared in 5200 ; BC , when the Comb Ceramic culture was introduced . The arrival of the Corded Ware culture in Southern coastal Finland between 3000 and 2500 BC may have coincided with the start of agriculture . Even with the introduction of agriculture , hunting and fishing continued to be important parts of the subsistence economy .
In the Bronze Age permanent all-year-round cultivation and animal husbandry spread , but the cold climate phase slowed the change . Cultures in Finland shared common features in pottery and also axes had similarities but local features existed . Seima-Turbino phenomenon Seima-Turbino-phenomenon brought first bronze artifacts to the region and possibly also the Finno-Ugric languages Finno-Ugric-Languages . Commercial contacts that had so far mostly been to Estonia started to extend to Scandinavia . Domestic manufacture of bronze artifacts started 1300 BC with Maaninka-type bronze axes . Bronze was imported from Volga River region and from Southern Scandinavia .
In the Iron Age population grew especially in Hme and Savo regions . Finland proper was the most densely populated area . Cultural contacts to the Baltics and Scandinavia became more frequent . Commercial contacts in the Baltic Sea region grew and extended during the 8th and 9th centuries .
Main exports from Finland were furs , slaves , castoreum , and falcons to European courts . Imports included silk and other fabrics , jewelry , Ulfberht swords , and , in lesser extent , glass . Production of iron started approximately in 500 BC .
At the end of the 9th century , indigenous artifact culture , especially women 's jewelry and weapons , had more common local features than ever before . This has been interpreted to be expressing common Finnish identity which was born from an image of common origin .
An early form of Finnic languages spread to the Baltic Sea region approximately 1900 BC with the Seima-Turbino phenomenon Seima-Turbino-phenomenon . Common Finnic language was spoken around Gulf of Finland 2000 years ago . The dialects from which the modern-day Finnish language was developed came into existence during the Iron Age . Although distantly related , the Sami people retained the hunter-gatherer lifestyle longer than the Finns . The Sami cultural identity and the Sami languages have survived in Lapland , the northernmost province , but the Sami have been displaced or assimilated elsewhere .
The 12th and 13th centuries were a violent time in the northern Baltic Sea . The Livonian Crusade was ongoing and the Finnish tribes such as the Tavastians and Karelia ( historical province of Finland ) were in Early Finnish Wars with Republic of Novgorod and with each other . Also , during the 12th and 13th centuries several crusades from the Catholic realms of the Baltic Sea area were made against the Finnish tribes . According to historical sources , Danes waged at least three crusades to Finland , in 1187 or slightly earlier , in 1191 and in 1202 , and Swedes , possibly the so-called Second Swedish Crusade , in 1249 against Tavastians and the Third Swedish Crusade in 1293 against the Karelians . The so-called First Swedish Crusade , possibly in 1155 , is most likely an unreal event . Also , it is possible that Germans made violent conversion of Finnish pagans in the 13th century . According to a papal letter from 1241 , the king of Norway was also fighting against `` nearby pagans '' at that time .
=== Swedish era ===
As a result of the crusades and the colonisation of some Finnish coastal areas with Christian Swedish-speaking population of Finland during the Middle Ages , including the old capital Turku , Finland gradually became part of the kingdom of Sweden and the sphere of influence of the Catholic Church . Due to the Swedish conquest , the Finnish upper class lost its position and lands to the new Swedish and German nobility and to the Catholic Church . In Sweden even in the 17th and 18th centuries , it was clear that Finland was a conquered country and its inhabitants could be treated arbitrarily . Swedish kings visited Finland rarely and in Swedish contemporary texts Finns were portrayed to be primitive and their language inferior .
Finland Swedish became the dominant language of the nobility , administration , and education ; Finnish language was chiefly a language for the peasantry , clergy , and local courts in predominantly Finnish-speaking areas . During the Protestant Reformation , the Finns gradually converted to Lutheranism .
In the 16th century , Mikael Agricola published the first written works in Finnish , and Finland 's current capital city , Helsinki , was founded by Gustav I of Sweden . The first university in Finland , the Royal Academy of Turku , was established in 1640 . The Finns reaped a reputation in the Thirty Years ' War ( 16181648 ) as a well-trained cavalrymen called `` Hakkapeliitta '' , that division excelled in sudden and savage attacks , raid ( military ) and reconnaissance , which Gustavus Adolphus of Sweden took advantage of in his significant battles , like in the Battle of Breitenfeld ( 1631 ) ( 1631 ) and the Battle of Rain ( 1632 ) . Finland suffered a severe Great Famine of Finland ( 16951697 ) famine in 16961697 , during which about one third of the Finnish population died , and a The plague during the Great Northern War .
In the 18th century , wars between Sweden and Russia twice led to the occupation of Finland by Russian forces , times known to the Finns as the Greater Wrath ( 17141721 ) and the Russo-Swedish War ( 17411743 ) ( 17421743 ) . It is estimated that almost an entire generation of young men was lost during the Great Wrath , due mainly to the destruction of homes and farms , and to the burning of Helsinki . By this time Finland was the predominant term for the whole area from the Gulf of Bothnia to the Russian border .
Two Russo-Swedish wars in twenty-five years served as reminders to the Finnish people of the precarious position between Sweden and Russia . An increasingly vocal elite in Finland soon determined that Finnish ties with Sweden were becoming too costly , and following Russo-Swedish War ( 17881790 ) Russo-Swedish War ( 17881790 ) , the Finnish elite 's desire to break with Sweden only heightened .
Even before the war there were conspiring politicians , among them Georg Magnus Sprengtporten Col G. M. Sprengtporten , who had supported Gustav III of Sweden # Coup d'tat Gustav III 's coup in 1772 . Sprengporten fell out with the king and resigned his commission in 1777 . In the following decade he tried to secure Russian support for an autonomous Finland , and later became an adviser to Catherine II . In the spirit of the notion of Adolf Ivar Arwidsson ( 17911858 ) , `` we are not Swedes , we do not want to become Russians , let us therefore be Finns '' , the Finnish national identity started to become established .
Notwithstanding the efforts of Finland 's elite and nobility to break ties with Sweden , there was no genuine independence movement in Finland until the early 20th century . As a matter of fact , at this time the Finnish peasantry was outraged by the actions of their elite and almost exclusively supported Gustav 's actions against the conspirators . ( The High Court of Turku condemned Sprengtporten as a traitor c . 1793 . ) The Swedish era ended in the Finnish War in 1809.
=== Russian Empire era ===
On 29 March 1809 , having been taken over by the armies of Alexander I of Russia in the Finnish War , Finland became an autonomous Grand Duchy of Finland in the Russian Empire with the recognition given at Diet of Porvoo held in Porvoo , until the end of 1917 . In 1811 , Alexander I incorporated the Russian Vyborg Governorate into the Grand Duchy of Finland . In 1854 , Finland became involved in Russia 's involvement in the Crimean War , when the British and French navies bombed the Finnish coast and land during the so-called land War . During the Russian era , the Finnish language began to gain recognition . From the 1860s onwards , a strong Finnish Ethnic nationalism known as the Fennoman movement grew , and one of its most prominent leading figures of the movement was the philosopher J. V. Snellman , who was strictly inclined to Hegelianism Hegel 's idealism , and who pushed for the stabilization of the status of the Finnish language and its own currency , the Finnish markka , in the Grand Duchy of Finland . Milestones included the publication of what would become Finland 's national epic  the Kalevala  in 1835 , and the Finnish language 's achieving equal legal status with Swedish in 1892.
The Finnish famine of 18661868 killed approximately 15 % of the population , making it one of the worst famines in European history . The famine led the Russian Empire to ease financial regulations , and investment rose in following decades . Economic and political development was rapid . The gross domestic product ( GDP ) per capita was still half of that of the United States and a third of that of Britain .
In 1906 , universal suffrage was adopted in the Grand Duchy of Finland . However , the relationship between the Grand Duchy and the Russian Empire soured when the Russian government made moves to restrict Finnish Autonomous area . For example , the universal suffrage was , in practice , virtually meaningless , since the tsar did not have to approve any of the laws adopted by the Finnish parliament . Desire for independence gained ground , first among radical liberals and socialists . The case is known as the `` Russification of Finland '' , driven by the last tsar of Russian Empire , Nicholas II of Russia .
=== Civil war and early independence ===
After the 1917 February Revolution , the position of Finland as part of the Russian Empire was questioned , mainly by Russian Social Democratic Labour Party . Since the head of state was the tsar of Russia , it was not clear who the chief executive of Finland was after the revolution . The Parliament , controlled by social democrats , passed the so-called Power Act to give the highest authority to the Parliament . This was rejected by the Russian Provisional Government which decided to dissolve the Parliament .
New elections were conducted , in which right-wing parties won with a slim majority . Some social democrats refused to accept the result and still claimed that the dissolution of the parliament ( and thus the ensuing elections ) were extralegal . The two nearly equally powerful political blocs , the right-wing parties and the social democratic party , were highly antagonized .
The October Revolution in Russia changed the geopolitical situation anew . Suddenly , the right-wing parties in Finland started to reconsider their decision to block the transfer of highest executive power from the Russian government to Finland , as the Bolsheviks took power in Russia . Rather than acknowledge the authority of the Independence of Finland # Power act of a few months earlier , the right-wing government , led by Prime Minister of Finland P. E. Svinhufvud , presented Finnish Declaration of Independence on 4 December 1917 , which was officially approved two days later by Parliament of Finland , on 6 December 1917 . Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic ( RSFSR ) , led by Vladimir Lenin , recognized independence on 4 January 1918.
On 27 January 1918 , the official opening shots of the war were fired in two simultaneous events . The government started to disarm the Russian forces in Ostrobothnia ( historical province ) , and the Social Democratic Party of Finland staged a coup . The latter gained control of southern Finland and Helsinki , but the white government continued in exile from Vaasa . This sparked the brief but bitter Finnish Civil War . The White Guard ( Finland ) , who were supported by German Empire , prevailed over the Red Guards ( Finland ) , which were guided by Kullervo Manner 's desire to make young independent country a Finnish Socialist Workers ' Republic ( also known as `` Red Finland '' ) and thus part of RSFSR . After the war , tens of thousands of Reds and suspected sympathizers were interned in camps , where thousands died by execution or from malnutrition and disease . Deep social and political enmity was sown between the Reds and Whites and would last until the Winter War and beyond ; still , even nowadays , the civil war is an inherently sensitive , emotional topic . The civil war and the 19181920 activist expeditions called `` Heimosodat '' into Soviet Russia strained Eastern relations . At that time , the idea of Greater Finland was also properly on display for the first time .
After Kingdom of Finland ( 1918 ) , when an attempt to make Prince Frederick Charles of Hesse a king for Finland proved to be a poor success , Finland became a Presidential system republic , with K. J. Sthlberg elected as its first president in 1919 . As a liberal nationalist and with a legal background , Sthlberg anchored the state in liberal democracy , guarded the fragile germ of the rule of law , and embarked on internal reforms . Finland was also one of the first European countries to strongly aim for Women rights , which is why Miina Sillanp served on Tanner Cabinet Vin Tanner 's cabinet as the first female minister in Finnish history in 19261927 . The FinnishRussian border was determined by the Treaty of Tartu ( RussianFinnish ) in 1920 , largely following the historic border but granting Pechengsky District ( Petsamo ) and its Barents Sea harbour to Finland . Finnish democracy did not see any Soviet coup attempts and survived the anti-Communist Lapua Movement . The relationship between Finland and the Soviet Union was tense . Army officers were trained in France , and relations with Western Europe and Sweden were strengthened .
In 1917 , the population was 3 million . Credit-based land reform was enacted after the civil war , increasing the proportion of capital-owning population . About 70 % of workers were occupied in agriculture and 10 % in industry . The largest export markets were the United Kingdom and Germany .
===World War II and after===
Finland fought the Soviet Union in the Winter War of 19391940 after the Soviet Union attacked Finland and in the Continuation War of 19411944 , following Operation Barbarossa , when Finland aligned with Germany following Germany 's invasion of the Soviet Union . For 872 days , the German army , aided indirectly by Finnish forces , Siege of Leningrad , the USSR 's second-largest city . After resisting a VyborgPetrozavodsk Offensive in June/July 1944 led to a standstill , Finland reached an armistice with the Soviet Union . This was followed by the Lapland War of 19441945 , when Finland fought retreating German forces in northern Finland . Perhaps the most famous war heroes during the aforementioned wars were Simo Hyh , Aarne Juutilainen , and Lauri Trni .
The treaties signed in 1947 and 1948 with the Soviet Union included Finnish obligations , restraints , and reparationsas well as further Finnish territorial concessions in addition to those in the Moscow Peace Treaty of 1940 . As a result of the two wars , Finland ceded Pechengsky District , along with portions of Finnish Karelia and Salla . This amounted to 10 % of its land area and 20 % of its industrial capacity , including the ports of Vyborg ( Viipuri ) and the ice-free Liinakhamari ( Liinahamari ) . Evacuation of Finnish Karelia Almost the whole population , some 400,000 people , fled these areas . The former Finnish territory now constitutes part of Russia 's Republic of Karelia , Leningrad Oblast , and Murmansk Oblast . Finland was never occupied by Soviet forces and it retained its independence , but at a loss of about 97,000 soldiers . The Finnish war reparations to the Soviet Union amounted to $ 300 million ( million in ) .
Finland rejected Marshall Plan , in apparent Finlandization . However , the United States provided secret development aid and helped the Social Democratic Party , in hopes of preserving Finland 's independence . Establishing trade with the Western powers , such as the United Kingdom , and paying reparations to the Soviet Union produced a transformation of Finland from a primarily Agriculture economy to an industrialised one . Valmet was founded to create materials for war reparations . After the reparations had been paid off , Finland continued to trade with the Soviet Union in the framework of bilateral trade .
In 1950 , 46 % of Finnish workers worked in agriculture and a third lived in urban areas . The new jobs in manufacturing , services , and trade quickly attracted people to the towns . The average number of births per woman declined from a baby boom peak of 3.5 in 1947 to 1.5 in 1973 . When baby-boomers entered the workforce , the economy did not generate jobs quickly enough , and hundreds of thousands emigrated to the more industrialized Sweden , with emigration peaking in 1969 and 1970 . The 1952 Summer Olympics brought international visitors . Finland took part in trade liberalization in the World Bank , the International Monetary Fund and the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade .
Officially claiming to be Neutral country , Finland lay in the grey zone between the Western world and the Soviet Union . The Finno-Soviet Treaty of 1948 ( Finno-Soviet Pact of Friendship , Cooperation and Mutual Assistance ) gave the Soviet Union some leverage in Finnish domestic politics . This was extensively exploited by president Urho Kekkonen against his opponents . He maintained an effective monopoly on Soviet relations from 1956 on , which was crucial for his continued popularity . In politics , there was a tendency of avoiding any policies and statements that could be interpreted as anti-Soviet . This phenomenon was given the name `` Finlandization '' by the West German press . During the Cold War , Finland also developed into one of the centers of the Cold War espionage East-West espionage , in which both the KGB and the CIA played their parts . The 1949 established Finnish Security Intelligence Service ( SUPO , Suojelupoliisi ) , an operational Security agency authority and a police unit under the Ministry of the Interior ( Finland ) , whose core areas of activity are counter-Intelligence , counter-terrorism and national security , also participated in this activity in some places .
Despite close relations with the Soviet Union , Finland maintained a market economy . Various industries benefited from Bilateral trade with the Soviets , which explains the widespread support that pro-Soviet policies enjoyed among business interests in Finland . Economic growth was rapid in the postwar era , and by 1975 Finland 's GDP per capita was the 15th-highest in the world . In the 1970s and '80s , Finland built one of the most extensive welfare states in the world . Finland negotiated with the European Economic Community ( EEC , a predecessor of the European Union ) a treaty that mostly abolished customs duties towards the EEC starting from 1977 , although Finland did not fully join . In 1981 , President Urho Kekkonen 's failing health forced him to retire after holding office for 25 years .
Finland reacted cautiously to the collapse of the Soviet Union , but swiftly began increasing integration with the West . On 21 September 1990 , Finland unilaterally declared the Paris Peace Treaty obsolete , following the German reunification decision nine days earlier .
Miscalculated macroeconomic decisions , a Finnish banking crisis of 1990s , the collapse of its largest trading partner ( the Soviet Union ) , and a global economic downturn caused a deep Early 1990s depression in Finland . The depression bottomed out in 1993 , and Finland saw steady economic growth for more than ten years . Like other Nordic countries , Finland decentralised its economy since the late 1980s . Financial and product market regulation were loosened . Some state enterprises have been privatized and there have been some modest tax cuts . Finland joined the European Union in 1995 , and the Eurozone in 1999 . Much of the late 1990s economic growth was fueled by the success of the mobile phone manufacturer Nokia , which held a unique position of representing 80 % of the market capitalization of the Helsinki Stock Exchange .
== Geography ==
Lying approximately between latitudes 60th parallel north 60 and 70th parallel north 70 N , and longitudes 20th meridian east 20 and 32nd meridian east 32 E , Finland is one of the world 's northernmost countries . Of world capitals , only Reykjavk lies more to the north than Helsinki . The distance from the southernmost point  Hanko , Finland in Uusimaa  to the northernmost  Nuorgam in Lapland  is .
Finland has about 168,000 lakes ( of area larger than ) and 179,000 islands . Its largest lake , Saimaa , is the fourth largest in Europe . The Finnish Lakeland is the area with the most lakes in the country ; many of the major cities in the area , most notably Tampere , Jyvskyl and Kuopio , are located in the immediate vicinity of the large lakes . The greatest concentration of islands is found in the southwest , in the Archipelago Sea between continental Finland and the main island of land .
Much of the geography of Finland is a result of the Ice Age . The glaciers were thicker and lasted longer in Fennoscandia compared with the rest of Europe . Their eroding effects have left the Finnish landscape mostly flat with few hills and fewer mountains . Its highest point , the Halti at , is found in the extreme north of Lapland at the border between Finland and Norway . The highest mountain whose peak is entirely in Finland is Ridnitohkka at 1,316 ; m ( 4,318 ; ft ) , directly adjacent to Halti .
The retreating glaciers have left the land with moraine deposits in formations of eskers . These are ridges of stratified gravel and sand , running northwest to southeast , where the ancient edge of the glacier once lay . Among the biggest of these are the three Salpausselk ridges that run across southern Finland .
Having been compressed under the enormous weight of the glaciers , terrain in Finland is rising due to the post-glacial rebound . The effect is strongest around the Gulf of Bothnia , where land steadily rises about a year . As a result , the old sea bottom turns little by little into dry land : the surface area of the country is expanding by about annually . Relatively speaking , Finland is rising from the sea .
The landscape is covered mostly by coniferous taiga forests and fens , with little cultivated land . Of the total area 10 % is lakes , rivers and ponds , and 78 % forest . The forest consists of pine , spruce , birch , and other species . Finland is the largest producer of wood in Europe and among the largest in the world . The most common type of rock is granite . It is a ubiquitous part of the scenery , visible wherever there is no soil cover . Moraine or till is the most common type of soil , covered by a thin layer of [ of biological origin . Podzol ] profile development is seen in most forest soils except where drainage is poor . [ [ Gleysols and peat bogs occupy poorly drained areas .
=== Biodiversity ===
Phytogeography , Finland is shared between the Arctic , central European , and northern European provinces of the Circumboreal Region within the Boreal Kingdom . According to the World Wide Fund for Nature , the territory of Finland can be subdivided into three ecoregions : the Scandinavian and Russian taiga , Sarmatic mixed forests , and Scandinavian Montane Birch forest and grasslands . Taiga covers most of Finland from northern regions of southern provinces to the north of Lapland . On the southwestern coast , south of the Helsinki-Rauma , Finland line , forests are characterized by mixed forests , that are more typical in the Baltic region . In the extreme north of Finland , near the tree line and Arctic Ocean , Montane Birch forests are common . Finland had a 2018 Forest Landscape Integrity Index mean score of 5.08/10 , ranking it 109th globally out of 172 countries .
Similarly , Finland has a diverse and extensive range of fauna . There are at least sixty native mammalian species , 248 breeding bird species , over 70 fish species , and 11 reptile and frog species present today , many migrating from neighboring countries thousands of years ago .
Large and widely recognized wildlife mammals found in Finland are the brown bear , gray wolf , wolverine , and Moose . The brown bear , which is also nicknamed as the `` king of the forest '' by the Finns , is the country 's official national animal , which also occur on the coat of arms of the Satakunta Regions of Finland is a crown-headed black bear carrying a sword , possibly referring to the regional capital city of Pori , whose Swedish name Bjrneborg and the Latin name Arctopolis literally means `` bear city '' or `` bear fortress '' . Three of the more striking birds are the whooper swan , a large European swan and the national bird of Finland ; the Western capercaillie , a large , black-plumaged member of the grouse family ; and the Eurasian eagle-owl . The latter is considered an indicator of old-growth forest connectivity , and has been declining because of landscape fragmentation . The most common breeding birds are the willow warbler , common chaffinch , and redwing . Of some seventy species of freshwater fish , the northern pike , perch , and others are plentiful . Atlantic salmon remains the favourite of Fly fishing enthusiasts .
The endangered Saimaa ringed seal , one of only three lake seal species in the world , exists only in the Saimaa lake system of southeastern Finland , down to only 390 seals today . It has become the emblem of the Finnish Association for Nature Conservation .
=== Climate ===
The main factor influencing Finland 's climate is the country 's geographical position between the 60th and 70th northern parallels in the Eurasian continent 's coastal zone . In the Kppen climate classification , the whole of Finland lies in the subarctic climate , characterized by warm summers and freezing winters . Within the country , the temperateness varies considerably between the southern coastal regions and the extreme north , showing characteristics of both a Oceanic climate and a continental climate . Finland is near enough to the Atlantic Ocean to be continuously warmed by the Gulf Stream . The Gulf Stream combines with the moderating effects of the Baltic Sea and numerous inland lakes to explain the unusually warm climate compared with other regions that share the same latitude , such as Alaska , Siberia , and southern Greenland .
Winters in southern Finland ( when mean daily temperature remains below ) are usually about 100 days long , and in the inland the snow typically covers the land from about late November to April , and on the coastal areas such as Helsinki , snow often covers the land from late December to late March . Even in the south , the harshest winter nights can see the temperatures fall to although on coastal areas like Helsinki , temperatures below are rare . Climatic summers ( when mean daily temperature remains above ) in southern Finland last from about late May to mid-September , and in the inland , the warmest days of July can reach over . Although most of Finland lies on the taiga belt , the southernmost coastal regions are sometimes classified as [ name= '' Havas ''
In northern Finland , particularly in Lapland , the winters are long and cold , while the summers are relatively warm but short . The most severe winter days in Lapland can see the temperature fall down to . The winter of the north lasts for about 200 days with permanent snow cover from about mid-October to early May . Summers in the north are quite short , only two to three months , but can still see maximum daily temperatures above during heat waves . No part of Finland has Arctic tundra ] , but [ [ Alpine tundra can be found at the fells Lapland .
The Finnish climate is suitable for cereal farming only in the southernmost regions , while the northern regions are suitable for animal husbandry .
A quarter of Finland 's territory lies within the Arctic Circle and the midnight sun can be experienced for more days the farther north one travels . At Finland 's northernmost point , the sun does not set for 73 consecutive days during summer , and does not rise at all for 51 days during winter .
=== Regions ===
Finland consists of 19 Regions of Finland , called maakunta in Finnish and landskap in Swedish . The regions are governed by regional councils which serve as forums of cooperation for the Municipalities of Finland of a region . The main tasks of the regions are regional planning and development of enterprise and education . In addition , the public health services are usually organized on the basis of regions . Currently , the only region where a popular election is held for the council is Kainuu . Other regional councils are elected by municipal councils , each municipality sending representatives in proportion to its population .
In addition to inter-municipal cooperation , which is the responsibility of regional councils , each region has a state Employment and Economic Development Centre which is responsible for the local administration of labour , agriculture , fisheries , forestry , and entrepreneurial affairs . The Finnish Defence Forces regional offices are responsible for the regional defence preparations and for the administration of conscription within the region .
Regions represent dialectal , cultural , and economic variations better than the former Provinces of Finland , which were purely administrative divisions of the central government . Historically , regions are divisions of [ provinces of Finland ] , areas which represent dialects and culture more accurately .
Six Regional State Administrative Agencies of Finland were created by the state of Finland in 2010 , each of them responsible for one of the regions called alue in Finnish and region in Swedish ; in addition , land was designated a seventh region . These take over some of the tasks of the earlier Provinces of Finland ( lni/ln ) , which were abolished .
}
The region of Eastern Uusimaa Eastern Uusimaa ( It-Uusimaa ) was consolidated with Uusimaa on 1 January 2011.
=== Administrative divisions ===
The fundamental administrative divisions of the country are the Municipalities of Finland , which may also call themselves towns or cities . They account for half of public spending . Spending is financed by municipal income tax , state subsidies , and other revenue . , there are 310 municipalities , and most have fewer than 6,000 residents .
In addition to municipalities , two intermediate levels are defined . Municipalities co-operate in seventy Sub-regions of Finland sub-regions and nineteen Regions of Finland . These are governed by the member municipalities and have only limited powers . The autonomous province of land has a permanent democratically elected regional council . Sami people have a semi-autonomous Sami native region ( Finland ) in Lapland for issues on language and culture .
In the following chart , the number of inhabitants includes those living in the entire municipality ( kunta/kommun ) , not just in the built-up area . The land area is given in km2 , and the density in inhabitants per km2 ( land area ) . The figures are as of . The capital region  comprising Helsinki , Vantaa , Espoo and Kauniainen  forms a continuous conurbation of over 1.1 million people . However , common administration is limited to voluntary cooperation of all municipalities , e.g . in Helsinki Metropolitan Area Council .
== Politics ==
=== Constitution ===
The Constitution of Finland defines the political system ; Finland is a parliamentary republic within the framework of a representative democracy . The Prime Minister of Finland is the country 's most powerful person . The current version of the constitution was enacted on 1 March 2000 , and was amended on 1 March 2012 . Citizens can run and vote in parliamentary , municipal , presidential and Elections in the European Union .
=== President ===
The [ of state ] of Finland is President of Finland ( in Finnish : Suomen tasavallan presidentti ; in Swedish : Republiken Finlands president ) . Finland has had for most of its independence a semi-presidential system , but in the last few decades the powers of the President have been diminished . In constitution amendments , which came into effect in 1991 or 1992 and also with a new drafted constitution of 2000 , amended in 2012 , the President 's position has become primarily a ceremonial office . However , the President still leads the nation 's foreign politics together with the Council of State and is the commander-in-chief of the Defence Forces . The position still does entail some powers , including responsibility for Foreign relations of Finland ( excluding affairs related to the European Union ) in cooperation with the Finnish Government , being Commander-in-Chief , some decree and pardoning powers , and some appointive powers . Direct , one- or two-stage elections are used to elect the president for a term of six years and for a maximum of two consecutive 6-year terms . The current president is Sauli Niinist ; he took office on 1 March 2012 . Former presidents were Kaarlo Juho Sthlberg K. J. Sthlberg ( 19191925 ) , Lauri Kristian Relander L. K. Relander ( 19251931 ) , Pehr Evind Svinhufvud P. E. Svinhufvud ( 19311937 ) , Kysti Kallio ( 19371940 ) , Risto Ryti ( 19401944 ) , Carl Gustaf Emil Mannerheim C. G. E. Mannerheim ( 19441946 ) , Juho Kusti Paasikivi J. K. Paasikivi ( 19461956 ) , Urho Kekkonen ( 19561982 ) , Mauno Koivisto ( 19821994 ) , Martti Ahtisaari ( 19942000 ) , and Tarja Halonen ( 20002012 ) .
The current president was elected from the ranks of the National Coalition Party for the first time since 1946 . The presidency between 1946 and the present was instead held by a member of the Social Democratic Party of Finland or the Centre Party ( Finland ) .
=== Parliament ===
The 200-member Unicameralism Parliament of Finland ( Eduskunta , Riksdag ) exercises supreme legislative authority in the country . It may alter the constitution and ordinary laws , dismiss the cabinet , and override presidential vetoes . Its acts are not subject to judicial review ; the constitutionality of new laws is assessed by the parliament 's Parliament of Finland # Committees . The parliament is elected for a term of four years using the proportional D'Hondt method within a number of multi-seat constituencies through the Open list # Most open multi-member districts . Various parliament committees listen to experts and prepare legislation .
Since universal suffrage was introduced in 1906 , the parliament has been dominated by the Centre Party ( Finland ) ( former Agrarian Union ) , the National Coalition Party , and the Social Democratic Party of Finland . These parties have enjoyed approximately equal support , and their combined vote has totalled about 6580 % of all votes . Their lowest common total of MPs , 121 , was reached in the 2011 elections . For a few decades after 1944 , the Communist Party of Finland were a strong fourth party . Due to the electoral system of proportional representation , and the relative reluctance of voters to switch their support between parties , the relative strengths of the parties have commonly varied only slightly from one election to another . However , there have been some long-term trends , such as the rise and fall of the Communists during the Cold War ; the steady decline into insignificance of the Liberals ( Finland ) and its predecessors from 1906 to 1980 ; and the rise of the Green League since 1983.
The Marin Cabinet is the incumbent 76th government of Finland . It was formed following the collapse of the Rinne Cabinet and officially took office on 10 December 2019 . The cabinet consists of a coalition formed by the Social Democratic Party of Finland , the Centre Party ( Finland ) , the Green League , the Left Alliance ( Finland ) , and the Swedish People 's Party of Finland Swedish People 's Party .
=== Cabinet ===
After parliamentary elections , the parties negotiate among themselves on forming a new cabinet ( the Finnish Government ) , which then has to be approved by a simple majority vote in the parliament . The cabinet can be dismissed by a parliamentary vote of no confidence , although this rarely happens ( the last time in 1957 ) , as the parties represented in the cabinet usually make up a majority in the parliament .
The cabinet exercises most executive powers , and originates most of the bills that the parliament then debates and votes on . It is headed by the Prime Minister of Finland , and consists of him or her , of other ministers , and of the Chancellor of Justice # Finland . The current prime minister is Sanna Marin ( Social Democratic Party ) . Each minister heads his or her ministry , or , in some cases , has responsibility for a subset of a ministry 's policy . After the prime minister , the most powerful minister is the Minister of Finance ( Finland ) . The incumbent Minister of Finance is Matti Vanhanen .
As no one party ever dominates the parliament , Finnish cabinets are multi-party coalitions . As a rule , the post of prime minister goes to the leader of the biggest party and that of the minister of finance to the leader of the second biggest .
=== Law ===
The judicial system of Finland is a Civil law ( legal system ) system divided between courts with regular civil and criminal jurisdiction and administrative courts with jurisdiction over litigation between individuals and the public administration . Finnish law is codified and based on Judiciary of Sweden and in a wider sense , civil law or Roman law . The court system for civil and criminal jurisdiction consists of local courts ( krjoikeus , tingsrtt ) , regional appellate courts ( hovioikeus , hovrtt ) , and the Judicial system of Finland # Supreme Court ( korkein oikeus , hgsta domstolen ) . The administrative branch of justice consists of administrative courts ( hallinto-oikeus , frvaltningsdomstol ) and the Judicial system of Finland # Supreme Administrative Court ( korkein hallinto-oikeus , hgsta frvaltningsdomstolen ) . In addition to the regular courts , there are a few special courts in certain branches of administration . There is also a Judicial system of Finland # High Court of Impeachment for criminal charges against certain high-ranking officeholders .
Around 92 % of residents have confidence in Finland 's security institutions . The overall Crime in Finland is not high in the EU context . Some crime types are above average , notably the high [ rate for Western Europe . A day fine ] system is in effect and also applied to offenses such as [ [ speeding .
Finland has successfully fought against government corruption , which was more common in the 1970s and '80s . For instance , economic reforms and EU membership introduced stricter requirements for open bidding and many public monopolies were abolished . Today , Finland has a very low number of corruption charges ; Transparency International ranks Finland as one of the least corrupt countries in Europe .
In 2008 , Transparency International criticized the lack of transparency of the system of Finnish political finance . According to Group of States Against Corruption in 2007 , corruption should be taken into account in the Finnish system of election funds better . 2007 campaign finance scandal of Finland broke out in spring 2008 . Nine Ministers of Government submitted incomplete funding reports and even more of the members of parliament . The law includes no punishment of false funds reports of the elected politicians .
=== Human rights ===
6 in two sentences of the Finnish Constitution states : `` No one shall be placed in a different position on situation of sex , age , origin , language , religion , belief , opinion , state of health , disability or any other personal reason without an acceptable reason . ''
Finland has been ranked above average among the world 's countries in democracy , press freedom , and [ development ( humanity ) human development ] .
Amnesty International has expressed concern regarding some issues in Finland , such as alleged permitting of stopovers of CIA Extraordinary rendition , the imprisonment of objectors to military service , and societal discrimination against Romani people and members of other ethnic and linguistic minorities .
=== Foreign relations ===
According to the 2012 constitution , the president ( currently Sauli Niinist ) leads foreign policy in cooperation with the government , except that the president has no role in EU affairs .
In 2008 , president Martti Ahtisaari was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize . Finland was considered a cooperative model state , and Finland did not oppose proposals for a common EU defence policy . This was reversed in the 2000s , when Tarja Halonen and Erkki Tuomioja made Finland 's official policy to resist other EU members ' plans for common defence .
=== Social security ===
Finland has one of the world 's most extensive welfare systems , one that guarantees decent living conditions for all residents : Finns , and non-citizens . Since the 1980s the social security has been cut back , but still the system is one of the most comprehensive in the world . Created almost entirely during the first three decades after World War II , the social security system was an outgrowth of the traditional Nordic belief that the state was not inherently hostile to the well-being of its citizens , but could intervene benevolently on their behalf . According to some social historians , the basis of this belief was a relatively benign history that had allowed the gradual emergence of a free and independent peasantry in the Nordic countries and had curtailed the dominance of the nobility and the subsequent formation of a powerful right wing . Finland 's history has been harsher than the histories of the other Nordic countries , but not harsh enough to bar the country from following their path of social development .
=== Military ===
The Finnish Defence Forces consist of a En cadre of professional soldiers ( mainly officers and technical personnel ) , currently serving conscripts , and a large reserve . The standard readiness strength is 34,700 people in uniform , of which 25 % are professional soldiers . A universal male conscription is in place , under which all male Finnish nationals above 18 years of age serve for 6 to 12 months of armed service or 12 months of civilian ( non-armed ) service .
Voluntary post-conscription overseas peacekeeping service is popular , and troops serve around the world in UN , NATO , and EU missions . Approximately 500 women choose voluntary military service every year . Women are allowed to serve in all combat arms including front-line infantry and special forces .
The army consists of a highly mobile field army backed up by local defence units . The army defends the national territory and its military strategy employs the use of the heavily forested terrain and numerous lakes to wear down an aggressor , instead of attempting to hold the attacking army on the frontier .
Finnish defence expenditure per capita is one of the highest in the European Union . The Finnish military doctrine is based on the concept of total defence . The term total means that all sectors of the government and economy are involved in the defence planning . The armed forces are under the command of the Chief of Defence ( Finland ) ( currently General Jarmo Lindberg ) , who is directly subordinate to the president in matters related to military command . The branches of the military are the Finnish Army , the Finnish Navy , and the Finnish Air Force . The Finnish Border Guard is under the Ministry of the Interior but can be incorporated into the Defence Forces when required for defence readiness .
Even while Finland has n't joined the North Atlantic Treaty Organization , the country has joined the NATO Response Force , the EU Battlegroup , the NATO Partnership for Peace and in 2014 signed a NATO memorandum of understanding , thus forming a practical coalition . In 2015 , the Finland-NATO ties were strengthened with a host nation support agreement allowing assistance from NATO troops in emergency situations . Finland has been an active participant in the Afghanistan and Kosovo .
== Economy ==
The economy of Finland has a per capita output equal to that of other European economies such as those of France , Germany , Belgium , or the UK . The largest sector of the economy is the service sector at 66 % of GDP , followed by manufacturing and refining at 31 % . Primary sector of the economy represents 2.9 % . With respect to International trade , the key economic sector is manufacturing . The largest industries in 2007 were electronics ( 22 % ) ; machinery , vehicles , and other engineered metal products ( 21.1 % ) ; forest industry ( 13 % ) ; and chemicals ( 11 % ) . The gross domestic product peaked in 2008. , the country 's economy is at the 2006 level .
Finland has significant timber , mineral ( iron , chromium , copper , nickel , and gold ) , and freshwater resources . Forestry , paper factories , and the Agriculture ( on which taxpayers spend around 3 billion annually ) are important for rural residents so any policy changes affecting these sectors are politically sensitive for politicians dependent on rural votes . The Greater Helsinki area generates around one third of Finland 's GDP . In a 2004 OECD comparison , high-technology manufacturing in Finland ranked second largest after Ireland . Knowledge-intensive services have also resulted in the smallest and slow-growth sectors  especially agriculture and low-technology manufacturing  being ranked the second largest after Ireland .
Finland 's climate and soils make growing crops a particular challenge . The country lies between the latitudes 60N and 70N , and it has severe winters and relatively short growing seasons that are sometimes interrupted by frost . However , because the Gulf Stream and the North Atlantic Drift Current moderate the climate , Finland contains half of the world 's arable land north of 60 north latitude . Annual precipitation is usually sufficient , but it occurs almost exclusively during the winter months , making summer droughts a constant threat . In response to the climate , farmers have relied on quick-ripening and frost-resistant varieties of crops , and they have cultivated south-facing slopes as well as richer bottomlands to ensure production even in years with summer frosts . Most farmland was originally either forest or swamp , and the soil has usually required treatment with lime and years of cultivation to neutralize excess acid and to improve fertility . Irrigation has generally not been necessary , but drainage systems are often needed to remove excess water . Finland 's agriculture has been efficient and productiveat least when compared with farming in other European countries .
Forests play a key role in the country 's economy , making it one of the world 's leading wood producers and providing raw materials at competitive prices for the crucial wood-processing industries . As in agriculture , the government has long played a leading role in forestry , regulating tree cutting , sponsoring technical improvements , and establishing long-term plans to ensure that the country 's forests continue to supply the wood-processing industries . To maintain the country 's comparative advantage in forest products , Finnish authorities moved to raise lumber output toward the country 's ecological limits . In 1984 , the government published the Forest 2000 plan , drawn up by the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry . The plan aimed at increasing forest harvests by about 3 % per year , while conserving forestland for recreation and other uses .
Private sector employees amount to 1.8 million , out of which around a third with tertiary education . The average cost of a private sector employee per hour was 25.10 in 2004. , average purchasing power-adjusted income levels are similar to those of Italy , Sweden , Germany , and France . In 2006 , 62 % of the workforce worked for enterprises with less than 250 employees and they accounted for 49 % of total business turnover and had the strongest rate of growth . The female employment rate is high . Gender segregation between male-dominated professions and female-dominated professions is higher than in the US . The proportion of part-time workers was one of the lowest in OECD in 1999 . In 2013 , the 10 largest private sector employers in Finland were Itella , Nokia , OP Financial Group OP-Pohjola , ISS A/S , VR ( company ) , Kesko , UPM-Kymmene , YIT , Metso , and Nordea .
The unemployment rate was 9.4 % in 2015 , having risen from 8.7 % in 2014 . Youth unemployment rate rose from 16.5 % in 2007 to 20.5 % in 2014 . A fifth of residents are outside the job market at the age of 50 and less than a third are working at the age of 61 . In 2014 , nearly one million people were living with minimal wages or unemployed not enough to cover their costs of living .
, 2.4 million households reside in Finland . The average size is 2.1 persons ; 40 % of households consist of a single person , 32 % two persons and 28 % three or more persons . Residential buildings total 1.2 million , and the average residential space is per person . The average residential property without land costs 1,187 per sq metre and residential land 8.60 per sq metre . 74 % of households had a car . There are 2.5 million cars and 0.4 million other vehicles .
Around 92 % have a mobile phone and 83.5 % ( 2009 ) List of countries by number of Internet users . The average total household consumption was 20,000 , out of which housing consisted of about 5,500 , transport about 3,000 , food and beverages ( excluding alcoholic beverages ) at around 2,500 , and recreation and culture at around 2,000 . According to Invest in Finland , private consumption grew by 3 % in 2006 and consumer trends included durables , high-quality products , and spending on well-being .
In 2017 , Finland 's GDP reached 224 billion . However , second quarter of 2018 saw a slow economic growth . Unemployment rate fell to a near one-decade low in June , marking private consumption growth much higher .
Finland has the highest concentration of cooperatives relative to its population . The largest retailer , which is also the largest private employer , S Group S-Group , and the largest bank , OP-Group , in the country are both cooperatives .
=== Energy ===
The free and largely privately owned financial and physical Nordic energy markets traded in NASDAQ OMX Commodities Europe and Nord Pool Spot exchanges , have provided competitive prices compared with other EU countries . , Finland has roughly the lowest industrial electricity prices in the EU-15 ( equal to France ) .
In 2006 , the energy market was around 90 terawatt hours and the peak demand around 15 gigawatts in winter . This means that the List of countries by energy consumption per capita is around 7.2 tons of oil equivalent per year . Industry and construction consumed 51 % of total consumption , a relatively high figure reflecting Finland 's industries . Finland 's [ resources are limited to peat ] and wood . About 1015 % of the electricity is produced by [ web url=http : //www.metsavastaa.net/vattenkraft title=Metsvastaa : Vattenkraft language=sv publisher=Metsavastaa.net access-date=6 March 2011 url-status=dead archive-url=https : //web.archive.org/web/20090303204918/http : //www.metsavastaa.net/vattenkraft archive-date=3 March 2009 } } which is low compared with more mountainous Sweden or Norway . In 2008 , [ [ renewable energy ] ( mainly hydropower and various forms of wood energy ) was high at 31 % compared with the EU average of 10.3 % in final energy consumption . [ [ Russia in the European energy sector supplies more than 75 % of Finland 's List of countries by oil exports and 100 % of total List of countries by natural gas exports .
Finland has four privately owned nuclear reactors producing 18 % of the country 's energy and one research reactor ( decommissioned 2018 ) at the Otaniemi campus . The fifth AREVA-Siemens AG-built reactor  the world 's largest at 1600 MWe and a focal point of Europe 's nuclear industry  has faced many delays and is currently scheduled to be operational by 20182020 , a decade after the original planned opening . A varying amount ( 517 % ) of electricity has been imported from Russia ( at around 3 gigawatt power line capacity ) , Sweden and Norway .
The Onkalo spent nuclear fuel repository is currently under construction at the Olkiluoto Nuclear Power Plant in the municipality of Eurajoki , on the west coast of Finland , by the company Posiva . Energy companies are about to increase nuclear power production , as in July 2010 the Finnish parliament granted permits for additional two new reactors .
=== Transport ===
Finland 's road system is utilized by most internal cargo and passenger traffic . The annual state operated road network expenditure of around 1 billion is paid for with vehicle and fuel taxes which amount to around 1.5 billion and 1 billion , respectively . Among the Highways in Finland , the most significant and busiest main roads include the Turku Highway ( European route E18 ) , the Tampere Highway ( European route E12 ) , the Lahti Highway ( European route E75 ) , and the ring roads ( Ring I and Ring III ) of the Helsinki metropolitan area and the Tampere Ring Road of the Tampere urban area .
The main international passenger gateway is Helsinki Airport , which handled about 17 million passengers in 2016 . Oulu Airport is the second largest , whilst another List of airports in Finland have scheduled passenger services . The Helsinki Airport-based Finnair , Blue1 , and Nordic Regional Airlines , Norwegian Air Shuttle sell air services both domestically and internationally . Helsinki has an optimal location for great circle ( i.e . the shortest and most efficient ) routes between Western Europe and the Far East .
Despite having a low population density , the Government annually spends around 350 million to maintain the network of railway tracks . Rail transport is handled by the state owned VR Group , which has a 5 % passenger market share ( out of which 80 % are from urban trips in Greater Helsinki ) and 25 % cargo market share . Since 12 December 2010 , Karelian Trains , a joint venture between Russian Railways and VR Group , has been running Karelian Trains Class Sm6 operated high-speed services between Saint Petersburg 's Finlyandsky Rail Terminal and Helsinki 's Helsinki Central railway station railway stations . These services are branded as `` Allegro '' trains . The journey from Helsinki to Saint Petersburg takes only three and a half hours . A [ rail ] line is planned between ELSA-rata , with a line from the capital to Tampere also proposed . Helsinki opened the world 's northernmost Helsinki Metro in 1982 , which also serves the neighbouring city of Espoo since 2017.
The majority of international cargo shipments are handled at ports . Vuosaari Harbour in Helsinki is the largest container port in Finland ; others include Kotka , Hamina , Hanko , Finland , Pori , Rauma , Finland , and Oulu . There is passenger traffic from Helsinki and Turku , which have ferry connections to Tallinn , Mariehamn , Stockholm and Travemnde . The Helsinki-Tallinn route  one of the busiest passenger sea routes in the world  has also been served by a helicopter line , and the Helsinki-Tallinn Tunnel has been proposed to provide railway services between the two cities . Largely following the example of the resund Bridge ] between [ [ Sweden and Denmark , the Kvarken Bridge connecting Ume in Sweden and Vaasa in Finland to cross the Gulf of Bothnia has also been planned for decades .
=== Industry ===
Finland rapidly industrialized after World War II , achieving GDP per capita levels comparable to that of Japan or the UK in the beginning of the 1970s . Initially , most of the economic development was based on two broad groups of export-led industries , the `` metal industry '' ( metalliteollisuus ) and `` forest industry '' ( metsteollisuus ) . The `` metal industry '' includes shipbuilding , metalworking , the automotive industry , engineered products such as motors and Electronics industry , and production of metals and alloys including steel , copper and chromium . Many of the world 's biggest cruise ships , including MS Freedom of the Seas and the Oasis of the Seas have been built in Finnish shipyards .
The `` forest industry '' includes forestry , timber , pulp and paper , and is often considered a logical development based on Finland 's extensive forest resources , as 73 % of the area is covered by forest . In the pulp and paper industry , many major companies are based in Finland ; Ahlstrom-Munksj , Mets Board , and UPM ( company ) are all Finnish forest-based companies with revenues exceeding 1 billion . However , in recent decades , the Finnish economy has diversified , with companies expanding into fields such as electronics ( Nokia ) , metrology ( Vaisala ) , petroleum ( Neste ) , and video games ( Rovio Entertainment ) , and is no longer dominated by the two sectors of metal and forest industry . Likewise , the structure has changed , with the service sector growing , with manufacturing declining in importance ; agriculture remains a minor part . Despite this , production for export is still more prominent than in Western Europe , thus making Finland possibly more vulnerable to global economic trends .
In 2017 , the Finnish economy was estimated to consist of approximately 2.7 % agriculture , 28.2 % manufacturing and 69.1 % services . In 2019 , the per-capita income of Finland was estimated to be $ 48,869 . In 2020 , Finland was ranked 20th on the ease of doing business index , among 190 jurisdictions .
=== Public policy ===
Finnish politicians have often emulated other Nordics and the Nordic model . Nordics have been free-trading and relatively welcoming to skilled migrants for over a century , though in Finland immigration is relatively new . The level of protection in commodity trade has been low , except for agricultural products .
Finland has top levels of economic freedom in many areas . Finland is ranked 16th in the 2008 global Index of Economic Freedom and 9th in Europe . While the manufacturing sector is thriving , the OECD points out that the service sector would benefit substantially from policy improvements .
The 2007 International Institute for Management Development World Competitiveness Yearbook ranked Finland 17th most Competition ( companies ) . The World Economic Forum 2008 index ranked Finland the 6th most competitive . In both indicators , Finland 's performance was next to Germany , and significantly higher than most European countries . In the Business competitiveness index 20072008 Finland ranked third in the world .
Economists attribute much growth to reforms in the product markets . According to the OECD , only four EU-15 countries have less regulated product markets ( UK , Ireland , Denmark and Sweden ) and only one has less regulated financial markets ( Denmark ) . Nordic countries were pioneers in liberalizing energy , postal , and other markets in Europe . The legal system is clear and business bureaucracy less than most countries . Property rights are well protected and contractual agreements are strictly honoured . Finland is rated the least corrupt country in the world in the Corruption Perceptions Index and 13th in the Ease of doing business index . This indicates exceptional ease in cross-border trading ( 5th ) , contract enforcement ( 7th ) , business closure ( 5th ) , tax payment ( 83rd ) , and low worker hardship ( 127th ) .
Finnish law Universal validity of collective labour agreements that are drafted every few years for each profession and seniority level . The agreement becomes universally enforceable provided that more than 50 % of the employees support it , in practice by being a member of a relevant trade union . The unionization rate is high ( 70 % ) , especially in the middle class ( Confederation of Unions for Academic Professionals in Finland80 % ) . A lack of a national agreement in an industry is considered an exception .
=== Tourism ===
In 2017 , tourism in Finland grossed approximately 15.0 billion with a 7 % increase from the previous year . Of this , 4.6 billion ( 30 % ) came from foreign tourism . In 2017 , there were 15.2 million overnight stays of domestic tourists and 6.7 million overnight stays of foreign tourists . Much of the sudden growth can be attributed to the globalisation of the country as well as a rise in positive publicity and awareness . While Russia remains the largest market for foreign tourists , the biggest growth came from Chinese markets ( 35 % ) . Tourism contributes roughly 2.7 % to Finland 's GDP , making it comparable to agriculture and forestry .
Baltic Sea cruiseferries between major coastal and port cities in the Baltic region , including Helsinki , Turku , Mariehamn , Tallinn , Stockholm , and Travemnde , play a significant role in the local tourism industry . By passenger counts , the Port of Helsinki is the busiest port in the world . The Helsinki-Vantaa International Airport is the fourth busiest airport in the Nordic countries in terms of passenger numbers , and about 90 % of Finland 's international air traffic passes through the airport .
Lapland ( Finland ) has the highest tourism consumption of any Finnish region . Above the Arctic Circle , in midwinter , there is a polar night , a period when the sun does not rise for days or weeks , or even months , and correspondingly , midnight sun in the summer , with no sunset even at midnight ( for up to 73 consecutive days , at the northernmost point ) . Lapland is so far north that the aurora borealis , fluorescence in the high atmosphere due to solar wind , is seen regularly in the fall , winter , and spring . Finnish Lapland is also locally regarded as the home of Saint Nicholas or Santa Claus , with several theme parks , such as Santa Claus Village and Santa Park in Rovaniemi .
Tourist attractions in Finland include the natural landscape found throughout the country as well as urban attractions . Finland is covered with thick pine forests , rolling hills , and lakes . Finland contains 40 List of national parks of Finland ( such as the Koli National Park in North Karelia ) , from the Southern shores of the Gulf of Finland to the high fells of Lapland . Outdoor activities range from Nordic skiing , golf , fishing , yachting , lake cruises , hiking , and kayaking , among many others . Bird-watching is popular for those fond of avifauna , however hunting is also popular . Moose and [ are common game in Finland .

== Demographics ==
The population of Finland is currently about 5.5 million inhabitants and is aging with the birth rate at 10.42 births per 1,000 population per year , or a Total fertility rate of 1.49 children born per woman , one of the lowest in the world , below the replacement rate of 2.1 , it remains considerably below the high of 5.17 children born per woman in 1887 . Finland subsequently has one of the oldest populations in the world , with the average age of 42.6 years . Approximately half of voters are estimated to be over 50 years old . Finland has an average population density of 18 inhabitants per square kilometre . This is the third-lowest population density of any European country , behind those of Norway and Iceland , and the lowest population density in the EU . Finland 's population has always been concentrated in the southern parts of the country , a phenomenon that became even more pronounced during 20th-century urbanisation . Two of the three largest cities in Finland are situated in the Greater Helsinki metropolitan areaHelsinki and Espoo , and some municipalities in the metropolitan area have also shown clear growth of population year after year , the most notable being Jrvenp , Nurmijrvi , Kirkkonummi , Kerava and Sipoo . In the largest cities of Finland , Tampere holds the third place after Helsinki and Espoo while also Helsinki-neighbouring Vantaa is the fourth . Other cities with population over 100,000 are Turku , Oulu , Jyvskyl , Kuopio , and Lahti .
, there were 402,619 people with a foreign background living in Finland ( 7.3 % of the population ) , most of whom are from Russia , Estonia , Somalia , Iraq and former Yugoslavia . The children of foreigners are not automatically given Finnish citizenship , as Finnish nationality law practices and maintain jus sanguinis policy where only children born to at least one Finnish parent are granted citizenship . If they are born in Finland and can not get citizenship of any other country , they become citizens . Additionally , certain persons of Finnish descent who reside in countries that were once part of Soviet Union ] , retain the [ [ Right of return # Finland , a right to establish permanent residency in the country , which would eventually entitle them to qualify for citizenship . 387,215 people in Finland in 2018 were born in another country , representing 7 % of the population . The 10 largest foreign born groups are ( in order ) from Russia , Estonia , Sweden , Iraq , Somalia , China , Thailand , Serbia , Vietnam and Turkey .
The immigrant population is growing . By 2035 , the three largest cites in Finland are projected to have a foreign speaking population percentage of over a quarter each , with Helsinki rising to 26 % , Espoo to 30 % and Vantaa to 34 % . The Helsinki region alone will have 437,000 foreign speakers , up by 236,000.
=== Language ===
Finnish and Swedish language are the official languages of Finland . Finnish predominates nationwide while Swedish is spoken in some coastal areas in the west and south and in the autonomous region of land , which is the only monolingual Swedish speaking region in Finland . The native language of 87.3 % of the population is Finnish , which is part of the Finnic subgroup of the Uralic languages . The language is one of only four official Languages of the European Union not of Indo-European languages Indo-European origin . As a result it has no relation to the other dominant North Germanic languages in the Nordic countries . Finnish is closely related to Karelian language and Estonian language and more remotely to the Sami languages and Hungarian language . Swedish is the native language of 5.2 % of the population ( Swedish-speaking Finns ) . Finnish is dominant in all the country 's larger cities , although Helsinki , Turku and Vaasa have undergone a language shift since Finland got separated from Sweden .
Since Swedish is a compulsory school subject , general knowledge of the language is good also among non-native speakers . In 2005 , a total of 47 % of the Finnish citizens reported ability to speak Swedish either as primary or a secondary language . Likewise , a majority of mainland Sweden Finns are able to speak some or fluent Finnish . However , the vast majority of Sweden Finnish youth self-reported as seldom using Finnish with 71 % mostly or always speaking Swedish in social settings outside of their households . The Finnish side of the land border with Sweden is unilingually Finnish-speaking , with a stark language divide over the Torne River and the Swedish side having a Northern Sweden accent vastly differing from the version of language spoken in other parts of Finland . There is a sizeable pronunciation difference in the Swedish being spoken in the two countries although the mutual intelligibility is nearly universal .
The Nordic countries # Languages languages and Karelian language are also specially treated in some contexts .
Finnish Kalo language is spoken by some 5,0006,000 people ; it and Finnish Sign Language are also recognized in the constitution . There are two sign languages : Finnish Sign Language , spoken natively by 4,0005,000 people , and Finland-Swedish Sign Language , spoken natively by about 150 people . Mishar Tatar dialect is spoken by a Finnish Tatars minority of about 800 people whose ancestors moved to Finland mainly during Russian rule from the 1870s to the 1920s .
The Sami languages has an official language status in the north , in Lapland or in northern Lapland , where the Sami people predominate , numbering around 7,000 and recognized as an Indigenous peoples . About a quarter of them speak a Sami language as their mother tongue . The Sami languages that are spoken in Finland are Northern Sami , Inari Sami language , and Skolt Sami language .
The rights of minority groups ( in particular Sami people # Finland , Swedish-speaking population of Finland , and Finnish Kale ) are protected by the constitution .
The largest immigrant languages are Russian language ( 1.5 % ) , Estonian language ( 0.9 % ) , Arabic ( 0.6 % ) , Somali language ( 0.4 % ) and English language ( 0.4 % ) . English is studied by most pupils as a compulsory subject from the first grade ( at seven years of age ) in the comprehensive school ( in some schools other languages can be chosen instead ) , as a result of which Finns ' English language skills have been significantly strengthened over several decades . German , French , Spanish and Russian can be studied as second foreign languages from the fourth grade ( at 10 years of age ; some schools may offer other options ) .
93 % of Finns can speak a second language . The figures in this section should be treated with caution , as they come from the official Finnish population register . People can only register one language and so bilingual or multilingual language users ' language competencies are not properly included . A citizen of Finland that speaks bilingually Finnish and Swedish will often be registered as a Finnish only speaker in this system . Similarly `` old domestic language '' is a category applied to some languages and not others for political not linguistic reasons , for example Russian .
=== Largest cities ===
=== Religion ===
With 3.9 million members , the Evangelical Lutheran Church of Finland is one of the largest Lutheran churches in the world and is also by far Finland 's largest religious body ; at the end of 2019 , 68.7 % of Finns were members of the church . The Evangelical Lutheran Church of Finland sees its share of the country 's population declining by roughly one percent annually in recent years . The decline has been due to both church membership resignations and falling baptism rates . The second largest group , accounting for 26.3 % of the population in 2017 , has no religious affiliation . The irreligious group rose quickly from just below 13 % in the year 2000 . A small minority belongs to the Finnish Orthodox Church ( 1.1 % ) . Other Protestant denominations and the Roman Catholic Church are significantly smaller , as are the Jewish and other non-Christian communities ( totalling 1.6 % ) ; for example , in the Protestant trend , there are about 1,500 Baptists concentrated in the region of Central Finland , and there are only about 2,000 Methodism who are scattered around the country . The Pew Research Center estimated the Muslim population at 2.7 % in 2016 . The main Lutheran and Orthodox churches are national churches of Finland with special roles such as in state ceremonies and schools .
In 1869 , Finland was the first Nordic country to disestablishment Evangelical Lutheran Church of Finland by introducing the Church Act , followed by the Church of Sweden in 2000 . Although the church still maintains a special relationship with the state , it is not described as a state religion in the Constitution of Finland or other laws passed by the Finnish Parliament . Finland 's state church was the Church of Sweden until 1809 . As an autonomous Grand Duchy under Russia 18091917 , Finland retained the Lutheran State Church system , and a state church separate from Sweden , later named the Evangelical Lutheran Church of Finland , was established . It was detached from the state as a separate judicial entity when the new church law came to force in 1869 . After Finland had gained independence in 1917 , religious freedom was declared in the constitution of 1919 and a separate law on religious freedom in 1922 . Through this arrangement , the Evangelical Lutheran Church of Finland lost its position as a state church but gained a constitutional status as a national church alongside the Finnish Orthodox Church , whose position however is not codified in the constitution .
In 2016 , 69.3 % of Finnish children were Baptism and 82.3 % were Confirmation ( Lutheran Church ) in 2012 at the age of 15 , and over 90 % of the funerals are Christian . However , the majority of Lutherans attend church only for special occasions like Christmas ceremonies , weddings , and funerals . The Lutheran Church estimates that approximately 1.8 % of its members attend church services weekly . The average number of church visits per year by church members is approximately two .
According to a 2010 Eurobarometer poll , 33 % of Finnish citizens responded that `` they believe there is a God '' ; 42 % answered that `` they believe there is some sort of spirit or life force '' ; and 22 % that `` they do not believe there is any sort of spirit , God , or life force '' . According to ISSP survey data ( 2008 ) , 8 % consider themselves `` highly religious '' , and 31 % `` moderately religious '' . In the same survey , 28 % reported themselves as `` agnostic '' and 29 % as `` non-religious '' .
=== Health ===
Life expectancy has increased from 71 years for men and 79 years for women in 1990 to 79 years for men and 84 years for women in 2017 . The under-five mortality rate has decreased from 51 per 1,000 live births in 1950 to 2.3 per 1,000 live births in 2017 , ranking Finland 's rate among the lowest in the world . The fertility rate in 2014 stood at 1.71 children born/per woman and has been below Sub-replacement fertility of 2.1 since 1969 . With a low birth rate women also become mothers at a later age , the mean age at first live birth being 28.6 in 2014 . A 2011 study published in The Lancet medical journal found that Finland had the lowest stillbirth rate out of 193 countries , including the UK , France and New Zealand .
There has been a slight increase or no change in welfare and health inequalities between population groups in the 21st century . Lifestyle-related diseases are on the rise . More than half a million Finns suffer from diabetes , type 1 diabetes being globally the most common in Finland . Many children are diagnosed with type 2 diabetes . The number of musculoskeletal diseases and cancers are increasing , although the cancer prognosis has improved . Allergies and dementia are also growing health problems in Finland . One of the most common reasons for work disability are due to mental disorders , in particular Major depressive disorder . Treatment for depression has improved and as a result the historically high suicide rates have declined to 13 per 100 000 in 2017 , closer to the North European average . Suicide rates are still among the highest among developed countries in the OECD .
There are 307 residents for each doctor . About 19 % of health care is funded directly by households and 77 % by taxation .
In April 2012 , Finland was ranked 2nd in Gross National Happiness in a report published by The Earth Institute . Since 2012 , Finland has every time ranked at least in the top 5 of world 's happiest countries in the annual World Happiness Report by the United Nations , as well as ranking as the happiest country in 2018.
=== Education and science ===
Most pre-tertiary education is arranged at municipal level . Even though many or most schools were started as private schools , today only around 3 percent of students are enrolled in private schools ( mostly specialist language and international schools ) , much less than in Sweden and most other developed countries . Pre-school education is rare compared with other EU countries and formal education is usually started at the age of 7 . Primary school takes normally six years and lower secondary school three years . Most schools are managed by municipal officials .
The flexible curriculum is set by the Ministry of Education ( Finland ) and the Education Board . Education is compulsory between the ages of 7 and 16 . After lower secondary school , graduates may either enter the workforce directly , or apply to trade schools or Gymnasium ( school ) ( upper secondary schools ) . Trade schools offer a vocational education : approximately 40 % of an age group choose this path after the lower secondary school . Academically oriented gymnasiums have higher entrance requirements and specifically prepare for Abitur and tertiary education . Graduation from either formally qualifies for tertiary education .
In tertiary education , two mostly separate and non-interoperating sectors are found : the profession-oriented polytechnics and the research-oriented universities . Education is free and living expenses are to a large extent financed by the government through student benefits . There are 15 universities and 24 Universities of Applied Sciences ( UAS ) in the country . The University of Helsinki is ranked 75th in the Top University Ranking of 2010 . The World Economic Forum ranks Finland 's tertiary education No . 1 in the world . Around 33 % of residents have a tertiary degree , similar to Nordics and more than in most other OECD countries except Canada ( 44 % ) , United States ( 38 % ) and Japan ( 37 % ) . The proportion of foreign students is 3 % of all tertiary enrollments , one of the lowest in OECD , while in advanced programs it is 7.3 % , still below OECD average 16.5 % . Other reputable universities of Finland include Aalto University in Espoo , both University of Turku and bo Akademi University in Turku , University of Jyvskyl , University of Oulu , LUT University in Lappeenranta and Lahti , University of Eastern Finland in Kuopio and Joensuu , and Tampere University .
More than 30 % of tertiary graduates are in science-related fields . Forest improvement , materials research , environmental sciences , neural networks , low-temperature physics , brain research , biotechnology , genetic technology , and communications showcase fields of study where Finnish researchers have had a significant impact .
Finland has a long tradition of adult education , and by the 1980s nearly one million Finns were receiving some kind of instruction each year . Forty percent of them did so for professional reasons . Adult education appeared in a number of forms , such as secondary evening schools , civic and workers ' institutes , study centres , vocational course centres , and folk high schools . Study centres allowed groups to follow study plans of their own making , with educational and financial assistance provided by the state . Folk high schools are a distinctly Nordic institution . Originating in Denmark in the 19th century , folk high schools became common throughout the region . Adults of all ages could stay at them for several weeks and take courses in subjects that ranged from handicrafts to economics .
Finland is highly productive in scientific research . In 2005 , Finland had the fourth most scientific publications per capita of the OECD countries . In 2007 , 1,801 patents were filed in Finland .
In addition , 38 percent of Finland 's population has a university or college degree , which is among the highest percentages in the world .
In 2010 a new law was enacted considering the universities , which defined that there are 16 of them as they were excluded from the public sector to be autonomous legal and financial entities , however enjoying special status in the legislation . As result many former state institutions were driven to collect funding from private sector contributions and partnerships . The change caused deep rooted discussions among the academic circles .
English language is important in Finnish education . There are a number of degree programs that are taught in English , which attracts thousands of degree and exchange students every year .
In December 2017 the OECD reported that Finnish fathers spend an average of eight minutes a day more with their school-aged children than mothers do .
== Culture ==
=== Sauna ===
The Finns ' love for saunas is generally associated with Finnish cultural tradition in the world . Sauna is a type of dry steam bath practiced widely in Finland , which is especially evident in the strong tradition around Midsummer and Christmas . In Finland , the sauna has been a traditional cure or part of the treatment for many different diseases , thanks to the heat , which why the sauna has been a very Hygiene place . There is an old Finnish saying : `` Jos sauna , terva ja viina ei auta , on tauti kuolemaksi . '' ( in literally : `` If sauna , tar and Liquor does n't help you , then a disease is deadly '' ) The word is of Proto-Finnish origin ( found in Finnic and Smi languages ) dating back 7,000 years . Steam baths have been part of European tradition elsewhere as well , but the sauna has survived best in Finland , in addition to Sweden , the Baltic states Baltic States ] , Russia , Norway , and parts of the United States and Canada . Moreover , nearly all Finnish houses have either their own sauna or in multistory apartment houses , a timeshare sauna . Public saunas were previously common , but the tradition has declined when saunas have been built nearly everywhere ( private homes , municipal swimming halls , hotels , corporate headquarters , gyms , etc. ) . At one time , the [ [ World Sauna Championships were held in Heinola , Finland , but the death of a Russian competitor in 2010 finally stopped organizing the competitions as too dangerous .
The Finnish sauna culture was inscribed on the UNESCO Intangible Cultural Heritage Lists at the 17 December 2020 meeting of the UNESCO Intergovernmental organization Committee Convention for the Safeguarding of the Intangible Cultural Heritage . As authorized by the state , the Finnish Heritage Agency commits , together with Finnish sauna communities and promoters of the sauna culture , to safeguard the vitality of the sauna tradition and to highlight its importance as part of customs and wellbeing .
=== Literature ===
Written Finnish could be said to have existed since Mikael Agricola translated the New Testament into Finnish during the Protestant Reformation , but few notable works of literature were written until the 19th century and the beginning of a Finnish national Romanticism . This prompted Elias Lnnrot to collect Finnish and Karelian folk poetry and arrange and publish them as the Kalevala , the Finnish national epic . The era saw a rise of poets and novelists who wrote in Finnish , notably Aleksis Kivi ( The Seven Brothers ) , Minna Canth ( Anna Liisa ) , Eino Leino ( Helkavirsi ) , Johannes Linnankoski ( The Song of the Blood-Red Flower ) and Juhani Aho ( The Railroad ( novel ) and Juha ( novel ) ) . Many writers of the national awakening wrote in Swedish , such as the national poet J. L. Runeberg ( The Tales of Ensign Stl ) and Zachris Topelius ( The Tomten in bo Castle ) .
After Finland became independent , there was a rise of Modernist literature , most famously the Finnish-speaking Mika Waltari and Swedish-speaking Edith Sdergran . Frans Eemil Sillanp was awarded the Nobel Prize in Literature in 1939 . World War II prompted a return to more national interests in comparison to a more international line of thought , characterized by Vin Linna with his The Unknown Soldier ( novel ) and Under the North Star trilogy . Besides Lnnrot 's Kalevala and Waltari , the Swedish-speaking Tove Jansson , best known as the creator of The Moomins , is the most translated Finnish writer ; her books have been translated into more than 40 languages . Popular modern writers include Arto Paasilinna , Veikko Huovinen , Antti Tuuri , Ilkka Remes , Kari Hotakainen , Sofi Oksanen , Tuomas Kyr , and Jari Tervo , while the best novel is annually awarded the prestigious Finlandia Prize .
=== Visual arts , design , and architecture ===
The visual arts in Finland started to form their individual characteristics in the 19th century , when Romantic nationalism was rising in autonomic Finland . The best known of Finnish painters , Akseli Gallen-Kallela , started painting in a naturalist style , but moved to national romanticism . Other notable world-famous Finnish painters include Magnus Enckell , Pekka Halonen , Eero Jrnefelt , Helene Schjerfbeck and Hugo Simberg . Finland 's best-known sculptor of the 20th century was Win Aaltonen , remembered for his monumental Bust ( sculpture ) and sculptures . Finns have made major contributions to [ and industrial design ] : among the internationally renowned figures are [ [ Timo Sarpaneva , Tapio Wirkkala and Ilmari Tapiovaara . Finnish architecture is famous around the world , and has contributed significantly to several styles internationally , such as Jugendstil ( or Art Nouveau ) , Nordic Classicism and Functionalism ( architecture ) . Among the top 20th-century Finnish architects to gain international recognition are Eliel Saarinen and his son Eero Saarinen . Architect Alvar Aalto is regarded as among the most important 20th-century designers in the world ; he helped bring Functionalism ( architecture ) to Finland , but soon was a pioneer in its development towards an organic style . Aalto is also famous for his work in furniture , lamps , textiles and glassware , which were usually incorporated into his buildings .
=== Music ===
; Classical
Much of Finland 's classical music is influenced by traditional Karelian melodies and lyrics , as comprised in the Kalevala . Karelian culture is perceived as the purest expression of the Baltic Finns myths and beliefs , less influenced by Germanic peoples influence than the Nordic folk dance music that largely replaced the kalevaic tradition . Finnish folk music has undergone a roots revival in recent decades , and has become a part of popular music .
The people of northern Finland , Sweden , and Norway , the Sami people , are known primarily for highly spiritual songs called joik . The same word sometimes refers to lavlu or vuelie songs , though this is technically incorrect .
The first Finnish opera was written by the German-born composer Fredrik Pacius in 1852 . Pacius also wrote the music to the poem Maamme Maamme/Vrt land ( Our Country ) , Finland 's national anthem . In the 1890s Finnish nationalism based on the Kalevala spread , and Jean Sibelius became famous for his vocal symphony Kullervo ( Sibelius ) . He soon received a grant to study runo singers in Karelia and continued his rise as the first prominent Finnish musician . In 1899 he composed Finlandia , which played its important role in Finland gaining independence . He remains one of Finland 's most popular national figures and is a symbol of the nation . Another one of the most significant and internationally best-known Finnish-born classical composers long before Sibelius was Bernhard Crusell .
Today , Finland has a very lively classical music scene and many of Finland 's important List of Finnish composers are still alive , such as Magnus Lindberg ( Finnish composer ) , Kaija Saariaho , Kalevi Aho , and Aulis Sallinen . The composers are accompanied by a large number of great conductors such as Esa-Pekka Salonen , Osmo Vnsk , Jukka-Pekka Saraste , and Leif Segerstam . Some of the internationally acclaimed Finnish classical musicians are Karita Mattila , Soile Isokoski , Pekka Kuusisto , Olli Mustonen , and Linda Brava .

Modern Finnish popular music includes a number of prominent rock bands , jazz musicians , [ hop ] performers , dance music acts , etc . Also , at least a couple of Finnish polkas are known worldwide , such as Skkijrven polkka and Ievan polkka .
During the early 1960s , the first significant wave of Finnish rock groups emerged , playing instrumental rock inspired by groups such as The Shadows . Around 1964 , Beatlemania arrived in Finland , resulting in further development of the local rock scene . During the late 1960s and '70s , Finnish rock musicians increasingly wrote their own music instead of translating international hits into Finnish . During the decade , some progressive rock groups such as Tasavallan Presidentti and Wigwam ( Finnish band ) gained respect abroad but failed to make a commercial breakthrough outside Finland . This was also the fate of the rock and roll group Hurriganes . The Finnish punk scene produced some internationally acknowledged names including Terveet Kdet in the 1980s . Hanoi Rocks was a pioneering 1980s glam rock act that inspired the American [ rock ] group Guns N ' Roses , among others .
Many Finnish metal bands have gained international recognition ; Finland has been often called the `` Promised Land of Heavy Metal '' , because there are more than 50 metal Bands for every 100,000 inhabitants  more than any other nation in the world .

Refugees from Karelia contributed to foods in eastern Finland .
Finnish foods often use wholemeal products ( rye , barley , oats ) and berries ( such as bilberry , lingonberry , cloudberry , and sea buckthorn ) . Milk and its derivatives like buttermilk are commonly used as food , drink , or in various recipes . Various turnips were common in traditional cooking , but were replaced with the potato after its introduction in the 18th century .
According to the statistics , red meat consumption has risen , but still Finns eat less beef than many other nations , and more fish and poultry . This is mainly because of the high cost of meat in Finland .
Finland has the world 's highest per capita consumption of coffee . Milk consumption is also high , at an average of about , per person , per year , even though 17 % of the Finns are lactose intolerant .

Tunisia , officially the Republic of Tunisia , is a country in the Maghreb region of North Africa . It is bordered by Algeria to the west and southwest , Libya to the southeast , and the Mediterranean Sea to the north and east ; covering , Tunisia is the smallest country in North Africa . It contains the eastern end of the Atlas Mountains and the northern reaches of the Sahara desert , with much of its remaining territory arable land . Its of coastline include the African conjunction of the western and eastern parts of the Mediterranean Basin . Tunisia 's northernmost point , Cape Angela , is also the northernmost point of Africa . Its population was 11.7 million in 2019 , and the capital and largest city is Tunis , located on the northeast coast , which lends the country its name .
From early antiquity , Tunisia was inhabited by the indigenous Berbers . Phoenicians began to arrive in the 12th century BC , establishing several settlements , of which Carthage emerged as the most powerful by the seventh century BC . A major mercantile empire and a military rival of the Roman Republic , Carthage was Battle of Carthage ( c. 149 BC ) by the Romans in 146 BC , who occupied Tunisia for most of the next 800 years , introducing Christianity and leaving architectural legacies like the amphitheatre of El Jem . After several attempts starting in 647 , Muslim conquest of the Maghreb all of Tunisia by 697 , bringing Islam and Arabization to the local population . The Ottoman Empire established control in 1574 and held sway for over 300 years , until the French conquest of Tunisia in 1881 . Tunisia gained independence under the leadership of Habib Bourguiba , who declared the Tunisian Republic in 1957 . Tunisian culture and identity are rooted in this centuries-long intersection of different cultural and ethnic groups .
In 2011 , the Tunisian Revolution ended the 24-year regime of president Zine El Abidine Ben Ali and triggered the broader Arab Spring across the region . The Arab Spring was caused by the lack of freedom and democracy in Tunisia . Free multiparty parliamentary Tunisian Constituent Assembly election , 2011 were held shortly after ; the country again voted for parliament on 26 October 2014 , and for president on 23 November 2014 . Tunisia remains a Unitary state Semi-presidential system semi-presidential Representative democracy republic ; it is the only country in North Africa classified as `` Free '' by Freedom House , and considered the only fully democratic state in the Arab World in the Economist Intelligence Unit 's Democracy Index . Tunisia has a high [ development index ] and List of African countries by GDP ( PPP ) per capita in Africa .
Tunisia is well integrated into the international community : It is a member of the United Nations , La Francophonie , the Arab League , the OIC , the African Union , the Non-Aligned Movement , the International Criminal Court , and the Group of 77 , among others . It maintains close economic and political relations with Europe , particularly FranceTunisia relations and ItalyTunisia relations , and has an European Union Association Agreement with the European Union . Tunisia has also attained the status of major non-NATO ally of the United States .
==Etymology==
The word Tunisia is derived from Tunis ; a central urban hub and the capital of modern-day Tunisia . The present form of the name , with its Latinate suffix , evolved from French Tunisie , in turn generally associated with the Berber languages root  , transcribed tns , which means `` to lay down '' or `` encampment '' . It is sometimes also associated with the Punic goddess Tanit Tanith ( aka Tunit ) , ancient city of Tynes .
The French derivative Tunisie was adopted in some European languages with slight modifications , introducing a distinctive name to designate the country . Other languages remained untouched , such as the Russian  ( ) and Spanish Tnez . In this case , the same name is used for both country and city , as with the Arabic  rtl=yes , and only by context can one tell the difference .
Before Tunisia , the territory 's name was Ifriqiya or Africa ( Roman province ) , which gave the present-day name of the continent Africa .
==History==
===Antiquity===
Farming methods reached the Nile from the Fertile Crescent region about 5000 BC , and spread to the Maghreb by about 4000 BC . Agricultural communities in the humid coastal plains of central Tunisia then were ancestors of today 's Berber people tribes .
It was believed in ancient times that Africa was originally populated by Gaetulians and Libyans , both nomadic peoples . According to the Roman historian Sallust , the demigod Hercules died in Spain and his polyglot eastern army was left to settle the land , with some Human migration to Africa . Persians went to the West and intermarried with the Gaetulians and became the Numidians . The Medes settled and were known as Mauri , later Moors .
The Numidians and Moors belonged to the race from which the Berbers are descended . The translated meaning of Numidian is Nomad and indeed the people were semi-nomadic until the reign of Masinissa of the Massyli tribe .
At the beginning of recorded history , Tunisia was inhabited by Berber people tribes . Its coast was settled by Phoenicians starting as early as the 12th century BC ( Bizerte , Utica , Tunisia ) . The city of Carthage was founded in the 9th century BC by Phoenicians . Legend says that Dido ( Queen of Carthage ) from Tyre , now in modern-day Lebanon , founded the city in 814 BC , as retold by the Greeks writer Timaeus ( historian ) . The settlers of Carthage brought their culture and religion from Phoenicia , now present-day Lebanon and adjacent areas .
After the series of wars with Greek city-states of Sicily in the 5th century BC , Carthage rose to power and eventually became the dominant civilization in the Western Mediterranean . The people of Carthage worshipped a pantheon of Middle Eastern gods including Baal and Tanit . Tanit 's symbol , a simple female figure with extended arms and long dress , is a popular icon found in ancient sites . The founders of Carthage also established a Tophet , which was altered in Roman times .
A Carthaginian invasion of Italy led by Hannibal during the Second Punic War , one of a series of wars with Roman Republic , nearly crippled the rise of Roman power . From the conclusion of the Second Punic War in 202 BC , Carthage functioned as a client state of the Roman Republic for another 50 years .
Following the Battle of Carthage ( c. 149 BC ) which began in 149 BC during the Third Punic War , Carthage was conquered by Rome in 146 BC . Following its conquest , the Romans renamed Carthage to Africa ( Roman province ) , incorporating it as a province .
During the Roman period , the area of what is now Tunisia enjoyed a huge development . The economy , mainly during the Empire , boomed : the prosperity of the area depended on agriculture . Called the Granary of the Empire , the area of actual Tunisia and coastal Tripolitania , according to one estimate , produced one million tons of cereals each year , one-quarter of which was exported to the Empire . Additional crops included beans , figs , grapes , and other fruits .
By the 2nd century , olive oil rivaled cereals as an export item . In addition to the cultivations and the capture and transporting of exotic wild animals from the western mountains , the principal production and exports included the textiles , marble , wine , timber , livestock , pottery such as African Red Slip , and wool .
There was even a huge production of mosaics and ceramics , exported mainly to Italy , in the central area of El Djem ( where there was the second biggest amphitheater in the Roman Empire ) .
Berber bishop Donatus Magnus was the founder of a Christian group known as the Donatists . During the 5th and 6th centuries ( from 430 to 533 AD ) , the Germanic Vandals invaded and ruled over a kingdom in Northwest Africa that included present-day Tripoli . The region was easily reconquered in 533534 AD , during the rule of Emperor Justinian I , by the Byzantine Empire led by General Belisarius .
===Middle Ages===
Sometime between the second half of the 7th century and the early part of the 8th century , Arab Muslim conquest of the Maghreb . They founded the first Islamic city in Northwest Africa , Kairouan . It was there in 670 AD that the Mosque of Uqba , or the Great Mosque of Kairouan , was constructed . This mosque is the oldest and most prestigious sanctuary in the Muslim West with the oldest standing minaret in the world ; it is also considered a masterpiece of Islamic art and architecture .
Tunis was taken in 695 , re-taken by the Byzantine Eastern Romans in 697 , but lost permanently in 698 . The transition from a Latin-speaking Christian Berber society to a Muslim and mostly Arabic-speaking society took over 400 years ( the equivalent process in Egypt and the Fertile Crescent took 600 years ) and resulted in the final disappearance of Christianity and Latin in the 12th or 13th centuries . The majority of the population were not Muslim until quite late in the 9th century ; a vast majority were during the 10th . Also , some Tunisian Christians emigrated ; some richer members of society did so after the conquest in 698 and others were welcomed by Norman rulers to Sicily or Italy in the 11th and 12th centuries  the logical destination because of the 1200 year close connection between the two regions .
The Arab governors of Tunis founded the Aghlabids , which ruled Tunisia , Tripolitania and eastern Algeria from 800 to 909 . Tunisia flourished under Arab rule when extensive systems were constructed to supply towns with water for household use and irrigation that promoted agriculture ( especially olive production ) . This prosperity permitted luxurious court life and was marked by the construction of new palace cities such as al-Abassiya ( 809 ) and Raqadda ( 877 ) .
After conquering Cairo , the Fatimids abandoned Tunisia and parts of Eastern Algeria to the local Zirids ( 9721148 ) . Zirid Tunisia flourished in many areas : agriculture , industry , trade , and religious and secular learning . Management by the later Zirid emirs was neglectful though , and political instability was connected to the decline of Tunisian trade and agriculture .
The depredation of the Tunisian campaigns by the Banu Hilal , a warlike Arab Bedouin tribe encouraged by the Fatimids of Egypt to seize Northwest Africa , sent the region 's rural and urban economic life into further decline . Consequently , the region underwent rapid urbanisation as famines depopulated the countryside and industry shifted from agriculture to manufactures . The Arab historian Ibn Khaldun wrote that the lands ravaged by Banu Hilal invaders had become completely arid desert .
The main Tunisian cities were conquered by the Normans of Sicily under the Kingdom of Africa in the 12th century , but following the conquest of Tunisia in 11591160 by the Almohads the Normans were evacuated to Sicily . Communities of Tunisian Christians would still exist in Nefzaoua up to the 14th century . The Almohads initially ruled over Tunisia through a governor , usually a near relative of the Caliph . Despite the prestige of the new masters , the country was still unruly , with continuous rioting and fighting between the townsfolk and wandering Arabs and Turks , the latter being subjects of the Muslim Armenian adventurer Karakush . Also , Tunisia was occupied by Ayyubids between 1182 and 1183 and again between 1184 and 1187.
The greatest threat to Almohad rule in Tunisia was the Banu Ghaniya , relatives of the Almoravids , who from their base in Mallorca tried to restore Almoravid rule over the Maghreb . Around 1200 they succeeded in extending their rule over the whole of Tunisia until they were crushed by Almohad troops in 1207 . After this success , the Almohads installed Walid Abu Hafs as the governor of Tunisia . Tunisia remained part of the Almohad state , until 1230 when the son of Abu Hafs declared himself independent . During the reign of the Hafsid dynasty , fruitful commercial relationships were established with several Christian Mediterranean states . In the late 16th century the coast became a pirate stronghold .
===Ottoman Tunisia===
In the last years of the Hafsid dynasty , Spain seized many of the coastal cities , but these were recovered by the Ottoman Empire .
The Conquest of Tunis ( 1534 ) took place in 1534 under the command of Hayreddin Barbarossa , the younger brother of Oru Reis , who was the Kapudan Pasha of the Ottoman Navy during the reign of Suleiman the Magnificent . However , it was not until the Conquest of Tunis ( 1574 ) in 1574 under Kapudan Pasha Ulu Ali Reis that the Ottomans permanently acquired the former History of medieval Tunisia # Hafsid dynasty of Tunis , retaining it until the French conquest of Tunisia in 1881.
Initially under Turkish rule from Algiers , soon the Ottoman Porte appointed directly for Tunis a governor called the Pasha supported by janissary forces . Before long , however , Tunisia became in effect an autonomous province , under the local Bey . Under its Turkish People governors , the Beys , Tunisia attained virtual independence . The Husainid Dynasty of Beys , established in 1705 , lasted until 1957 . This evolution of status was from time to time challenged without success by Algiers . During this era the governing councils controlling Tunisia remained largely composed of a foreign elite who continued to conduct state business in the Turkish language .
Attacks on European shipping were made by Barbary corsairs , primarily from Algiers , but also from Tunis and Tripoli , yet after a long period of declining raids the growing power of the European states finally forced its termination . Under the Ottoman Empire , the boundaries of Tunisia contracted ; it lost territory to the west ( Constantine , Algeria ) and to the east ( Tripoli ) .
The Second plague pandemic ravaged Tunisia in 17841785 , 17961797 and 18181820 .
In the 19th century , the rulers of Tunisia became aware of the ongoing efforts at political and social Tanzimat . The Bey of Tunis then , by his own lights but informed by the Turkish example , attempted to effect a modernizing reform of institutions and the economy . Tunisian international debt grew unmanageable . This was the reason or pretext for French forces to establish a History of French era Tunisia in 1881.
===French Tunisia ( 18811956 ) ===
In 1869 , Tunisia declared itself bankrupt and an international financial commission took control over its economy . In 1881 , using the pretext of a Tunisian incursion into Algeria , the French invaded with an army of about 36,000 and forced the Bey to agree to the terms of the 1881 Treaty of Bardo ( Al Qasr as Sa'id ) . With this treaty , Tunisia was officially made a French occupation of Tunisia , over the objections of Italy . Under French colonization , European settlements in the country were actively encouraged ; the number of French people colonists grew from 34,000 in 1906 to 144,000 in 1945 . In 1910 there were 105,000 Italian Tunisians .
During World War II , French Tunisia was ruled by the collaborationist Vichy France government located in Metropolitan France . The antisemitic Vichy anti-Jewish legislation enacted by the Vichy was also implemented in Vichy Northwest Africa and overseas French territories . Thus , the persecution , and murder of the Jews from 1940 to 1943 was part of the The Holocaust in France .
From November 1942 until May 1943 , Vichy Tunisia was occupied by Nazi Germany . SS Commander Walter Rauff continued to implement the Final Solution there . From 19421943 , Tunisia was the scene of the Tunisia Campaign , a series of battles between the Axis powers and Allies of World War II forces . The battle opened with initial success by the German and Italian forces , but the massive supply and numerical superiority of the Allies led to the Tunisian Campaign on 13 May 1943.
===Post-independence ( 19562011 ) ===
Tunisia achieved independence from France on 20 March 1956 with Habib Bourguiba as Prime Minister . 20 March is celebrated annually as Tunisian Independence Day . A year later , Tunisia was declared a republic , with Bourguiba as List of Presidents of Tunisia . From independence in 1956 until the 2011 revolution , the government and the Constitutional Democratic Rally ( RCD ) , formerly Neo Destour and the Socialist Destourian Party , were effectively one . Following a report by Amnesty International , The Guardian called Tunisia `` one of the most modern but repressive countries in the Arab world '' .
In November 1987 , doctors declared Bourguiba unfit to rule and , in a bloodless coup d'tat , Prime Minister Zine El Abidine Ben Ali assumed the presidency in accordance with Article 57 of the Tunisian constitution . The anniversary of Ben Ali 's succession , 7 November , was celebrated as a national holiday . He was consistently re-elected with enormous majorities every five years ( well over 80 percent of the vote ) , the last being 25 October 2009 , until he fled the country amid popular unrest in January 2011.
Ben Ali and his family were accused of corruption and plundering the country 's money . Economic liberalisation provided further opportunities for financial mismanagement , while corrupt members of the Trabelsi family , most notably in the cases of Imed Trabelsi and Belhassen Trabelsi , controlled much of the business sector in the country . The First Lady Leila Ben Ali was described as an `` unabashed Oniomania '' who used the state airplane to make frequent unofficial trips to Europe 's fashion capitals . Tunisia refused a French request for the extradition of two of the President 's nephews , from Leila 's side , who were accused by the French State prosecutor of having stolen two mega-yachts from a French marina . Ben Ali 's son-in-law Sakher El Materi was rumoured as being primed to eventually take over the country .
Independent human rights groups , such as Amnesty International , Freedom House , and Protection International , documented that basic human and political rights were not respected . The regime obstructed in any way possible the work of local human rights organizations . In 2008 , in terms of Press freedom , Tunisia was ranked 143rd out of 173.
===Post-revolution ( since 2011 ) ===
The Tunisian Revolution was an intensive campaign of civil resistance that was precipitated by high unemployment , food inflation , corruption , a lack of freedom of speech and other political freedoms and poor living conditions . Labour unions were said to be an integral part of the protests . The protests inspired the Arab Spring , a wave of similar actions throughout the Arab world .
The catalyst for mass demonstrations was the death of Mohamed Bouazizi , a 26-year-old Tunisian street vendor , who set himself afire on 17 December 2010 in protest at the confiscation of his wares and the humiliation inflicted on him by a municipal official named Faida Hamdy . Anger and violence intensified following Bouazizi 's death on 4 January 2011 , ultimately leading longtime President of Tunisia Zine El Abidine Ben Ali to resign and flee the country on 14 January 2011 , after 23 years in power .
Protests continued for banning of the ruling party and the eviction of all its members from the transitional government formed by Mohammed Ghannouchi . Eventually the new government gave in to the demands . A Tunis court banned the ex-ruling party RCD and confiscated all its resources . A decree by the minister of the interior banned the `` political police '' , special forces which were used to intimidate and persecute political activists .
On 3 March 2011 , the interim president announced that Tunisian Constituent Assembly election , 2011 would be held on 24 July 2011 . On 9 June 2011 , the prime minister announced the election would be postponed until 23 October 2011. International and internal observers declared the vote free and fair . The Ennahda Movement , formerly banned under the Ben Ali regime , came out of the election as the largest party , with 89 seats out of a total of 217 . On 12 December 2011 , former dissident and veteran human rights activist Moncef Marzouki was elected president .
In March 2012 , Ennahda declared it will not support making sharia the main source of legislation in the new constitution , maintaining the secular nature of the state . Ennahda 's stance on the issue was criticized by hardline Islamists , who wanted strict sharia , but was welcomed by secular parties . On 6 February 2013 , Chokri Belaid , the leader of the leftist opposition and prominent critic of Ennahda , was assassinated .
In 2014 , President Moncef Marzouki established Tunisia 's Truth and Dignity Commission ( Tunisia ) , as a key part of creating a national reconciliation .
Tunisia was hit by two terror attacks on foreign tourists in 2015 , Bardo National Museum attack at the Bardo National Museum ( Tunis ) , and 2015 Sousse attacks at the Sousse beachfront . Tunisian president Beji Caid Essebsi renewed the state of emergency in October for three more months .
The Tunisian National Dialogue Quartet won the 2015 Nobel Peace Prize for its work in building a peaceful , pluralistic political order in Tunisia .
==Geography==
Tunisia is situated on the Mediterranean coast of Northwest Africa , midway between the Atlantic Ocean and the Nile Delta . It is bordered by Algeria on the west and southwest and Libya on the south east . It lies between latitudes 30th parallel north 30 and 38th parallel north 38N , and longitudes 7th meridian east 7 and 12th meridian east 12E . An abrupt southward turn of the Mediterranean coast in northern Tunisia gives the country two distinctive Mediterranean coasts , westeast in the north , and northsouth in the east .
Though it is relatively small in size , Tunisia has great environmental diversity due to its northsouth extent . Its eastwest extent is limited . Differences in Tunisia , like the rest of the Maghreb , are largely northsouth environmental differences defined by sharply decreasing rainfall southward from any point . The Dorsal , the eastern extension of the Atlas Mountains , runs across Tunisia in a northeasterly direction from the Algerian border in the west to the Cape Bon peninsula in the east . North of the Dorsal is the Tell , a region characterized by low , rolling hills and plains , again an extension of mountains to the west in Algeria . In the Khroumire , the northwestern corner of the Tunisian Tell , elevations reach and snow occurs in winter .
The Sahel , Tunisia , a broadening coastal plain along Tunisia 's eastern Mediterranean coast , is among the world 's premier areas of olive cultivation . Inland from the Sahel , between the Dorsal and a range of hills south of Gafsa , are the Steppes . Much of the southern region is semi-arid and desert .
Tunisia has a coastline long . In maritime terms , the country claims a contiguous zone of , and a territorial sea of .
===Climate===
Tunisia 's climate is Mediterranean climate in the north , with mild rainy winters and hot , dry summers . The south of the country is desert . The terrain in the north is mountainous , which , moving south , gives way to a hot , dry central plain . The south is semiarid , and merges into the Sahara . A series of Tunisian salt lakes , known as chotts or shatts , lie in an eastwest line at the northern edge of the Sahara , extending from the Gulf of Gabes into Algeria . The lowest point is Chott el Djerid at below sea level and the highest is Jebel ech Chambi at .
===Biodiversity===
Tunisia is home to five terrestrial ecoregions : Mediterranean conifer and mixed forests , Saharan halophytics , Mediterranean dry woodlands and steppe , Mediterranean woodlands and forests , and North Saharan steppe and woodlands . The country had a 2019 Forest Landscape Integrity Index mean score of 5.14/10 , ranking it 108th globally out of 172 countries .
==Politics==
Tunisia is a representative democracy and a republic with a President of Tunisia serving as [ of state ] , a Prime Minister of the Republic of Tunisia as [ of government ] , a unicameralism parliament , and a Civil law ( legal system ) . The Constitution of Tunisia , adopted 26 January 2014 , guarantees rights for women and states that the President 's religion `` shall be Islam '' . In October 2014 Tunisia held its first elections under the new constitution following the Arab Spring . Tunisia ( # 69 worldwide ) is the only democracy in North Africa .
The number of legalized political parties in Tunisia has grown considerably since the revolution . There are now over 100 legal parties , including several that existed under the former regime . During the rule of Ben Ali , only three functioned as independent opposition parties : the Progressive Democratic Party ( Tunisia ) , Democratic Forum for Labour and Liberties , and Ettajdid Movement . While some older parties are well-established and can draw on previous party structures , many of the 100-plus parties extant as of February 2012 are small .
Rare for the Arab world , women held more than 20 % of seats in the country 's pre-revolution bicameral parliament . In the 2011 constituent assembly , women held between 24 % and 31 % of all seats .
Tunisia is included in the European Union 's European Neighbourhood Policy ( ENP ) , which aims at bringing the EU and its neighbours closer . On 23 November 2014 Tunisia held its first Presidential Election following the Arab Spring in 2011.
The Tunisian legal system is heavily influenced by French civil law , while the Law of Personal Status is based on Islamic law . Sharia courts were abolished in 1956.
A Code of Personal Status ( Tunisia ) was adopted shortly after independence in 1956 , which , among other things , gave women full legal status ( allowing them to run and own businesses , have bank accounts , and seek passports under their own authority ) . The code outlawed the practices of polygamy and repudiation and a husband 's right to unilaterally divorce his wife . Further reforms in 1993 included a provision to allow Tunisian women to transmit citizenship even if they are married to a foreigner and living abroad . The Law of Personal Status is applied to all Tunisians regardless of their religion . The Code of Personal Status remains one of the most progressive civil codes in North Africa and the Muslim world .
===Military===
, Tunisia had an army of 27,000 personnel equipped with 84 main battle tanks and 48 light tanks . The navy had 4,800 personnel operating 25 patrol boats and 6 other craft . The Tunisian Air Force has 154 aircraft and 4 UAVs . Paramilitary forces consisted of a 12,000-member national guard . Tunisia 's military spending was 1.6 % of GDP . The army is responsible for national defence and also internal security . Tunisia has participated in peacekeeping efforts in the DROC and Ethiopia/Eritrea . United Nations peacekeeping deployments for the Tunisian armed forces have been in Cambodia ( UNTAC ) , Namibia ( UNTAG ) , Somalia , Rwanda , Burundi , Western Sahara ( MINURSO ) and the 1960s mission in the Congo , ONUC .
The military has historically played a professional , apolitical role in defending the country from external threats . Since January 2011 and at the direction of the executive branch , the military has taken on increasing responsibility for domestic security and humanitarian crisis response .
===Human rights===
After the revolution , a number of Salafi movement groups emerged and in some occasions have violently repressed artistic expression that is viewed to be hostile to Islam .
Since the revolution , some non-governmental organizations have reconstituted themselves and hundreds of new ones have emerged . For instance , the Tunisian Human Rights League , the first human rights organization in Africa and the Arab world , operated under restrictions and state intrusion for over half of its existence , but is now free to operate . Some independent organizations , such as the Tunisian Association of Democratic Women , the Association of Tunisian Women for Research and Development , and the Bar Association also remain active .
Homosexuality is illegal in Tunisia and can be punished by up to three years in prison . On 7 December 2016 , two Tunisian men were arrested on suspicion of homosexual activity in Sousse . According to 2013 survey by the Pew Research Center , 94 % of Tunisians believe that homosexuality should not be accepted by society .
The Tunisian regime has been criticised for its policy on recreational drug use , for instance automatic 1-year prison sentences for consuming cannabis . Prisons are crowded and drug offenders represent nearly a third of the prison population .
In 2017 , Tunisia became the first Arab world to outlaw domestic violence against women , which was previously not a crime . Also , the law allowing rapists to escape punishment by marrying the victim was abolished . According to Human Rights Watch , 47 % of Tunisian women have been subject to domestic violence .
===Administrative divisions===
Tunisia is subdivided into 24 governorates ( Wilaya ) , which are further divided into 264 `` Delegations of Tunisia '' or `` districts '' ( mutamadiyat ) , and further subdivided into municipality ( baladiyats ) and sectors ( imadats ) .
==Economy==
Tunisia is an export-oriented country in the process of liberalizing and privatizing an economy that , while averaging 5 % GDP growth since the early 1990s , has suffered from corruption benefiting politically connected elites . Tunisia 's Penal Code criminalises several forms of corruption , including active and passive bribery , abuse of office , extortion and conflicts of interest , but the anti-corruption framework is not effectively enforced . However , according to the Corruption Perceptions Index published annually by Transparency International , Tunisia was ranked the least corrupt Arab Africa North-African-country in 2016 , with a score of 41 . Tunisia has a diverse economy , ranging from agriculture , mining , manufacturing , and petroleum products , to Tourism in Tunisia . In 2008 it had a Gross domestic product of US $ 41 billion ( Exchange rate ) , or $ 82 billion ( purchasing power parity ) .
The agricultural sector accounts for 11.6 % of the GDP , industry 25.7 % , and services 62.8 % . The industrial sector is mainly made up of clothing and footwear manufacturing , production of car parts , and electric machinery .

Tunisia was the first Mediterranean country to sign an Association Agreement with the European Union , in July 1995 , although even before the date of entry came into force , Tunisia started dismantling tariffs on bilateral EU trade . Tunisia finalised the tariffs dismantling for industrial products in 2008 and therefore was the first non-EU Mediterranean country to enter in a free trade area with EU .

Days before Tunisia 's 2019 parliamentary elections , the nation finds itself struggling with a sluggish economy . The Arab world 's only democratic state fought hard against the dictatorial regime of president Zine El Abidine Ben Ali during the Arab Spring . Nevertheless , Tunisia could not accomplish anything more than freedom and democracy . It still finds itself hanging between inflation and unemployment while looking up to the 6 October elections with hope of a reform .

France is set to become an important partner in Tunisia 's nuclear power plans , having signed an agreement , along with other partners , to deliver training and technology . , Tunisia has abandoned these plans . Instead , Tunisia is considering other options to diversify its energy mix , such as renewable energies , coal , shale gas , liquified natural gas and constructing a submarine power interconnection with Italy .
According to the Tunisian Solar Plan ( which is Tunisia 's Renewable Energy Strategy not limited to solar , contrary to what its title may suggest , proposed by the National Agency for Energy Conservation ) , Tunisia 's objective is to reach a share of 30 % of renewable energies in the electricity mix by 2030 , most of which should be accounted for by wind power and photovoltaics . , Tunisia had a total renewable capacity of 312 MW ( 245 MW wind , 62 MW hydropower , 15 MW photovoltaics . )
===Transport===
The country maintains of roads , with three highways : the A1 motorway ( Tunisia ) from Tunis to Sfax ( works ongoing for Sfax-Libya ) , A3 motorway ( Tunisia ) Tunis-Beja ( works ongoing Beja  Boussalem , studies ongoing Boussalem  Algeria ) and A4 motorway ( Tunisia ) Tunis  Bizerte .

services in the Middle East and North Africa . , access to
safe drinking water became close to universal approaching 100 % in urban
areas and 90 % in rural areas . Tunisia provides good quality drinking water throughout the year .
Responsibility for the water supply systems in urban areas and large rural centres is assigned to the Socite Nationale d'Exploitation et de Distribution des Eaux
( SONEDE ) , a national water supply authority that is an autonomous
public entity under the Ministry of Agriculture . Planning , design and
supervision of small and medium water supplies in the remaining rural
areas are the responsibility of the Direction Gnrale du Gnie Rurale ( DGGR ) .
In 1974 , ONAS was established to manage the sanitation sector . Since 1993 , ONAS has had the status of a main operator for
protection of water environment and combating pollution .
The rate of non-revenue water is the lowest in the region at 21 % in 2012.
==Demographics==
According to the CIA , as of 2017 , Tunisia has a population of 11,403,800 inhabitants . The government has supported a successful family planning program that has reduced the population growth rate to just over 1 % per annum , contributing to Tunisia 's economic and social stability .
=== Ethnic groups ===
According to CIA The World Factbook , ethnic groups in Tunisia are : Arab 98 % , European 1 % , Jewish and other 1 % .
According to the 1956 Tunisian census , Tunisia had a population at the time of 3,783,000 residents , mainly consisting of Berbers and Arabs . Speakers of Berber languages comprised 2 % of the population . According to another source the population of Arabs is estimated to be < 40 % to 98 % , and that of Berbers at 1 % to over 60 % .
Amazighs are concentrated in the Dahar mountains and on the island of Djerba in the south-east and in the Khroumire mountainous region in the north-west .
That said , an important number of genetic and other historical studies point out to the predominance of the Amazighs in Tunisia .
An Ottoman Empire influence has been particularly significant in forming the Turks in Tunisia Turco-Tunisian community . Other peoples have also migrated to Tunisia during different periods of time , including West Africans , Greeks , Ancient Rome , Phoenicians ( Punics ) , Jews , and French settlers . By 1870 the distinction between the Arabic-speaking mass and the Turkish elite had blurred .
From the late 19th century to after World War II , Tunisia was home to large populations of French people and Italian Tunisians ( 255,000 European Tunisians in 1956 ) , although nearly all of them , along with the Jewish population , left after Tunisia became independent . The [ of the Jews in Tunisia ] goes back some 2,000 years . In 1948 the Jewish population was an estimated 105,000 , but by 2013 only about 900 remained .
The first people known to history in what is now Tunisia were the Berber peoples . Numerous civilizations and peoples have invaded , migrated to , or have been assimilated into the population over the millennia , with influences of population from Phoenicians/Carthaginians , Roman Republics , Vandals , Arabs , Spaniards , Ottoman Empire and Janissaries , and French people . There was a continuing inflow of nomadic Banu Hilal from Arabia .
After the Reconquista and expulsion of non-Christians and Moriscos from Spain , many Spanish Muslims and Jews also arrived . According to Matthew Carr , `` As many as eighty thousand Moriscos settled in Tunisia , most of them in and around the capital , Tunis , which still contains a quarter known as Zuqaq al-Andalus , or Andalusia Alley . ''
===Languages===
Arabic is the official language , and Tunisian Arabic , known as Tounsi , is the national , vernacular varieties of Arabic and is used by the public . There is also a small minority of speakers of Berber languages known collectively as Jebbali or Shelha .
French language also plays a major role in Tunisian society , despite having no official status . It is widely used in education ( e.g. , as the language of instruction in the sciences in secondary school ) , the press , and business . In 2010 , there were 6,639,000 French-speakers in Tunisia , or about 64 % of the population . Italian language is understood and spoken by a small part of the Tunisian people population .
Shop signs , menus and road signs in Tunisia are generally written in both Arabic and French .
===Major cities===
===Religion===
The majority of Tunisia 's population ( around 98 % ) are Muslims while about 2 % follow Christianity and Judaism or other religions . The bulk of Tunisians belong to the Maliki of Sunni Islam and their mosques are easily recognizable by square minarets . However , the Turkish people brought with them the teaching of the Hanafi during the Ottoman Empire rule , which still survives among the Turks in Tunisia today , and their mosques traditionally have octagonal minarets . Sunnis form the majority with non-denominational Muslims being the second largest group of Muslims , followed by Ibadite Amazighs .
Tunisia has a sizable Christians community of around over 35,000 adherents , mainly Catholics ( 22,000 ) and to a lesser degree Protestantism . Berber Christians continued to live in some Nefzaoua villages up until the early 15th century and the community of Christianity in Africa existed in the town of Tozeur up to the 18th century . International Religious Freedom Report for 2007 estimates thousands of Tunisian people Muslims have converted to Christianity . Judaism is the country 's third largest religion with between 1,000 and 1,400 members . One-third of the Jewish population lives in and around the capital . The remainder lives on the island of Djerba with 39 synagogues where the Jewish community dates back 2,600 years , in Sfax , and in Hammam-Lif .
Djerba , an island in the Gulf of Gabs , is home to El Ghriba synagogue , which is one of the Oldest synagogues in the World and the oldest uninterruptedly used . Many Jews consider it a pilgrimage site , with celebrations taking place there once every year due to its age and the legend that the synagogue was built using stones from Solomon 's temple . In fact , Tunisia along with Morocco has been said to be the Arab countries most accepting of their Jewish populations .
The constitution declares Islam as the official state religion and requires the President to be Muslim . Aside from the president , Tunisians enjoy a significant degree of religious freedom , a right enshrined and protected in its constitution , which guarantees the freedom of thoughts , beliefs and to practice one 's religion .
The country has a secular culture where religion is separated from not only political , but in public life . During the pre-revolution era there were at some point restrictions in the wearing of Islamic head scarves ( [ in government offices and on public streets and public gatherings . The government believed the hijab is a `` garment of foreign origin having a partisan connotation '' . There were reports that the Tunisian police harassed men with `` Islamic '' appearance ( such as those with beards ) , detained them , and sometimes compelled men to shave their beards off .
In 2006 , the former Tunisian president declared that he would `` fight '' the hijab , which he refers to as `` ethnic clothing '' . Mosques were restricted from holding communal prayers or classes . After the revolution however , a moderate Islamist government was elected leading to more freedom in the practice of religion . It has also made room for the rise of fundamentalist groups such as the Salafi ] sts , who call for a strict interpretation of Sharia law . The fall in favour of the moderate Islamist government of Ennahdha was partly due to that , modern Tunisian governments intelligence objectives are to suppress fundamentalist groups before they can act .
Individual Tunisians are tolerant of religious freedom and generally do not inquire about a person 's personal beliefs . Those who violate the rules of work and eating during the Islamic month of Ramadan may be arrested and jailed .
In 2017 a handful of men were arrested for eating in public during Ramadan ; they were convicted of committing `` a provocative act of public indecency '' and sentenced to month-long jail sentences . The state in Tunisia has a role as a `` guardian of religion '' which was used to justify the arrests .
===Education===
The total adult literacy rate in 2008 was 78 % and this rate goes up to 97.3 % when considering only people from 15 to 24 years old . Education is given a high priority and accounts for 6 % of [ [ Gross national product . A basic education for children between the ages of 6 and 16 has been compulsory since 1991 . Tunisia ranked 17th in the category of `` quality of the educational system '' and 21st in the category of `` quality of primary education '' in The Global Competitiveness Report ] 20089 , released by The World Economic Forum .
While children generally acquire [ [ Tunisian Arabic at home , when they enter school at age 6 , they are taught to read and write in Standard Arabic . From the age of 8 , they are taught French while English is introduced at the age of 12.
The four years of secondary education are open to all holders of Diplme de Fin d'Etudes de l'Enseignement de Base where the students focus on entering university level or join the workforce after completion . The Enseignement secondaire is divided into two stages : general academic and specialized . The higher education system in Tunisia has experienced a rapid expansion and the number of students has more than tripled over the past 10 years from approximately 102,000 in 1995 to 365,000 in 2005 . The gross enrollment rate at the tertiary level in 2007 was 31 percent , with gender parity index of GER of 1.5.
===Health===
In 2010 , spending on healthcare accounted for 3.37 % of the country 's GDP . In 2009 , there were 12.02 physicians and 33.12 nurses per 10,000 inhabitants . The life expectancy at birth was 75.73 years in 2016 , or 73.72 years for males and 77.78 years for females . Infant mortality in 2016 was 11.7 per 1,000.
==Culture==
The culture of Tunisia is mixed due to its long established history of outside influence from people  such as Phoenicians , Romans , Vandals , Byzantines , Arabs , Turks , Italians , Spaniards , and the French  who all left their mark on the country .
===Painting===
The birth of Tunisian contemporary painting is strongly linked to the School of Tunis , established by a group of artists from Tunisia united by the desire to incorporate native themes and rejecting the influence of Orientalist colonial painting . It was founded in 1949 and brings together French and Tunisian Muslims , Christians and Jews . Pierre Boucherle was its main instigator , along with Yahia Turki , Abdelaziz Gorgi , Moses Elias Levy , Ammar Farhat , and Jules Lellouche . Given its doctrine , some members have therefore turned to the sources of aesthetic Arab-Muslim art : such as miniature Islamic architecture , etc . Expressionist paintings by Amara Debbache , Jellal Ben Abdallah , and Ali Ben Salem are recognized while abstract art captures the imagination of painters like Edgar Naccache , Nello Levy , and Hedi Turki .
After independence in 1956 , the art movement in Tunisia was propelled by the dynamics of nation building and by artists serving the state . A Ministry of Culture was established , under the leadership of ministers such as Habib Boulars who oversaw art and education and power . Artists gained international recognition such as Hatem El Mekki or Zoubeir Turki and influenced a generation of new young painters . Sadok Gmech draws his inspiration from national wealth while Moncef Ben Amor turns to fantasy . In another development , Youssef Rekik reused the technique of painting on glass and founded Nja Mahdaoui calligraphy with its mystical dimension .
There are currently fifty art galleries housing exhibitions of Tunisian and international artists . These galleries include Gallery Yahia in Tunis and Carthage Essaadi gallery .
A new exposition opened in an old monarchal palace in Bardo dubbed the `` awakening of a nation '' . The exposition boasts documents and artifacts from the Tunisian reformist monarchal rule in mid 19th century .
===Literature===
Tunisian literature exists in two forms : Arabic and French . Arabic literature dates back to the 7th century with the arrival of Arab civilization in the region . It is more important in both volume and value than French literature , introduced during the French protectorate from 1881.
Among the literary figures include Ali Douagi , who has produced more than 150 radio stories , over 500 poems and folk songs and nearly 15 plays , Khraief Bashir , an Arabic novelist who published many notable books in the 1930s and which caused a scandal because the dialogues were written in Tunisian dialect , and others such as Moncef Ghachem , Mohamed Salah Ben Mrad , or Mahmoud Messadi .
As for poetry , Tunisian poetry typically opts for nonconformity and innovation with poets such as Aboul-Qacem Echebbi .
As for literature in French , it is characterized by its critical approach . Contrary to the pessimism of Albert Memmi , who predicted that Tunisian literature was sentenced to die young , a high number of Tunisian writers are abroad including Abdelwahab Meddeb , Bakri Tahar , Mustapha Tlili , Hele Beji , or Mellah Fawzi . The themes of wandering , exile and heartbreak are the focus of their creative writing .
The national bibliography lists 1249 non-school books published in 2002 in Tunisia , with 885 titles in Arabic . In 2006 this figure had increased to 1,500 and 1,700 in 2007 . Nearly a third of the books are published for children .
In 2014 Tunisian American creative nonfiction scribe and translator Med-Ali Mekki who wrote many books , not for publication but just for his own private reading translated the new Constitution of the Tunisian Republic from Arabic to English for the first time in Tunisian bibliographical history , the book was published worldwide the following year and it was the Internet 's most viewed and downloaded Tunisian book .
===Music===
At the beginning of the 20th century , musical activity was dominated by the liturgical repertoire associated with different religious brotherhoods and secular repertoire which consisted of instrumental pieces and songs in different Andalusian forms and styles of origins , essentially borrowing characteristics of musical language . In 1930 `` The Rachidia '' was founded well known thanks to artists from the Jewish community . The founding in 1934 of a musical school helped revive Arab Andalusian music largely to a social and cultural revival led by the elite of the time who became aware of the risks of loss of the musical heritage and which they believed threatened the foundations of Tunisian national identity . The institution did not take long to assemble a group of musicians , poets , scholars . The creation of Radio Tunis in 1938 allowed musicians a greater opportunity to disseminate their works .
Notable Tunisian musicians include Saber Reba , Dhafer Youssef , Belgacem Bouguenna , Sonia M'barek , Latifa ( singer ) , Salah El Mahdi , Anouar Brahem , Emel Mathlouthi and Lotfi Bouchnak .
===Media===
The TV media has long remained under the domination of the Establishment of the Broadcasting Authority Tunisia ( ERTT ) and its predecessor , the Tunisian Radio and Television , founded in 1957 . On 7 November 2006 , President Zine el-Abidine Ben Ali announced the demerger of the business , which became effective on 31 August 2007 . Until then , ERTT managed all public television stations ( Tlvision Tunisienne 1 as well as Tlvision Tunisienne 2 which had replaced the defunct RTT 2 ) and four national radio stations ( Radio Tunis , Tunisia Radio Culture , Youth and Radio RTCI ) and five regional Sfax , Monastir , Gafsa , Le Kef and Tataouine . Most programs are in Arabic but some are in French . Growth in private sector radio and television broadcasting has seen the creation of numerous operations including Radio Mosaique FM , Jawhara FM , Zaytuna FM , Hannibal TV , Ettounsiya TV , and Nessma TV .
In 2007 , some 245 newspapers and magazines ( compared to only 91 in 1987 ) are 90 % owned by private groups and independents . The Tunisian political parties have the right to publish their own newspapers , but those of the opposition parties have very limited editions ( like Al Mawkif or Mouwatinoun ) . Before the recent democratic transition , although freedom of the press was formally guaranteed by the constitution , almost all newspapers have in practice followed the government line report . Critical approach to the activities of the president , government and the Constitutional Democratic Rally Party ( then in power ) were suppressed . In essence , the media was dominated by state authorities through the Agence Tunis Afrique Presse . This has changed since , as the media censorship by the authorities have been largely abolished , and self-censorship has significantly decreased . Nonetheless , the current regulatory framework and social and political culture mean that the future of press and media freedom is still unclear .

The ITF Board decided to send a strong message to the Tunisian Tennis Federation that this kind of action will not be tolerated . ''

Saint Kitts and Nevis ( ) , officially known as the Federation of Saint Christopher and Nevis , is an island country in the West Indies . Located in the Leeward Islands chain of the Lesser Antilles , it is the smallest sovereign state in the Western Hemisphere , in both List of countries by area and List of countries by population . The country is a Commonwealth realm , with Elizabeth II as Queen and [ of state ] . It is the only Federated state in the Caribbean .
The capital city is Basseterre , located on the larger island of Saint Kitts . Basseterre is also the main port for both passenger entry ( via cruise ships ) and cargo . The smaller island of Nevis lies approximately to the southeast of Saint Kitts , across a shallow channel called The Narrows .
The British dependency of Anguilla was historically also a part of this union , which was then known collectively as Saint Christopher-Nevis-Anguilla . However , Anguilla chose to secede from the union and remains a British overseas territory . To the north-northwest lie the islands of Sint Eustatius , Saba , Saint Barthlemy , Saint Martin ( island ) Saint-Martin/Sint Maarten and Anguilla . To the east and northeast are Antigua and Barbuda , and to the southeast is the small uninhabited island of Redonda ( part of Antigua and Barbuda ) and the island of Montserrat .
Saint Kitts and Nevis were among the first islands in the Caribbean to be colonized by Europeans . Saint Kitts was home to the first British and French colonies in the Caribbean , and thus has also been titled `` The Mother Colony of the West Indies '' . It is also the most recent British territory in the Caribbean to become independent , gaining independence in 1983.
== Etymology ==
Saint Kitts was named Liamuiga , which roughly translates as 'fertile land ' , by the Island Caribs , who originally inhabited the island . The name is preserved via St. Kitts 's tallest peak , Mount Liamuiga . Nevis 's pre-Columbian name was Oualie , meaning `` land of beautiful waters '' .
It is thought that Christopher Columbus , the first European to see the islands in 1493 , named the larger island San Cristbal , after Saint Christopher , his patron saint and that of travellers . New studies suggest that Columbus named the island Sant Yago ( Saint James ) , and that the name San Cristbal was in fact given by Columbus to the island now known as Saba , northwest . It seems that San Cristbal came to be applied to the island of St. Kitts only as of the result of a mapping error . No matter the origin of the name , the island was well documented as San Cristbal by the 17th century . The first English colonists kept the English translation of this name , and dubbed it St. Christopher 's Island . In the 17th century , a common nickname for Christopher was Kit ( t ) ; hence , the island came to be informally referred to as Saint Kitt 's Island , later further shortened to Saint Kitts .
Columbus gave Nevis the name San Martn . The current name Nevis is derived from a Spanish name Nuestra Seora de las Nieves , meaning 'Our Lady of the Snows ' . It is not known who chose this name for the island , but it is a reference to the story of a 4th-century Miracle # Catholic Church : a summertime snowfall on the Esquiline Hill in Rome . It is thought that the white clouds which usually wreathe the top of Nevis Peak reminded someone of the story of a miraculous snowfall in a hot climate . The island of Nevis , upon first British settlement , was referred to as Dulcina , a name meaning 'sweet one ' in Spanish . Eventually , the original Spanish name was restored and used in the shortened form , Nevis .
Today the Constitution of Saint Kitts and Nevis refers to the state as both Saint Kitts and Nevis and Saint Christopher and Nevis , but the former is the one most commonly used , however the latter is generally used for diplomatic relations .
== History ==
===Pre-colonial period===
The name of the first inhabitants , Pre-Arawakan languages of the Greater Antilles pre-Arawakan peoples who settled the islands perhaps as early as 3000 years ago , is not known . They were followed by the Arawak peoples , or Tano , about 1000 BC . The warlike Island Caribs invaded about 800 AD .
===European arrival and early colonial period===
Christopher Columbus was the first European to sight the islands in 1493 . The first settlers were the English in 1623 , led by Thomas Warner ( explorer ) , who established a settlement at Old Road Town on the west coast of St Kitts after achieving an agreement with the Carib chief Ouboutou Tegremante . The French later also settled on St Kitts in 1625 under Pierre Belain d'Esnambuc . As a result , both parties agreed to partition the island into French and English sectors . From 1628 onward the English also began settling on Nevis .
The French and English , intent on self-enrichment through exploitation of the island 's natural resources , soon encountered resistance , with the native Caribs ( Kalinago ) waging war throughout the first three years of the settlements ' existence . The Europeans thus resolved to rid themselves of this problem once and for all . To facilitate this objective , an ideological campaign was waged by colonial chroniclers , dating back to the Spanish , as they produced literature which systematically denied Kalinago humanity ( a literary tradition carried through the late-seventeenth century by such authors as Jean-Baptiste du Tertre and Pere Labat ) . In 1626 the Anglo-French settlers joined forces to Kalinago Genocide of 1626 at a place that became known as Bloody Point , allegedly to pre-empt an imminent Carib plan to expel or kill all European settlers . With the native population thus pacified , the English and French began to establish large sugar plantations which were worked by vast numbers of imported African slaves . This system created enormous wealth for the planter-colonists whilst also drastically changing the islands ' demographics as black slaves soon came to outnumber Europeans by some margin .
A Spanish expedition of 1629 sent to enforce Spanish claims Battle of St. Kitts ( 1629 ) and deported the settlers back to their respective countries . As part of Anglo-Spanish War ( 1625-1630 ) settlement in 1630 , the Spanish permitted the re-establishment of the English and French colonies . Spain later formally recognised Britain 's claim to St Kitts with the Treaty of Madrid ( 1670 ) , in return for British cooperation in the fight against piracy .
As Spanish power went into decline , Saint Kitts became the premier base for English and French expansion into the wider Caribbean . From St. Kitts the British settled the islands of Antigua , Montserrat , Anguilla and Tortola , and the French settled Martinique , the Guadeloupe archipelago and Saint Barthlemy . During the late-17th century France and England fought for control over St Kitts and Nevis , fighting wars in Battle of Nevis , Nine Years ' War # Asia and the Caribbean 168990 and War of the Spanish Succession 170113 . The French renounced their claim to the islands with the Treaty of Utrecht in 1713 . The islands ' economy , already shattered by years of war , was further devastated by natural disasters : in 1690 an earthquake destroyed Jamestown , capital of Nevis , forcing the construction of a new capital at Charlestown , Nevis ; further damage was caused by a hurricane in 1707.
===British colonial period===
The colony had recovered by the turn of the 18th century , and by the close of the 1700s St. Kitts had become the richest British Crown Colony per capita in the Caribbean as result of its slave-based sugar industry . The 18th century also saw Nevis , formerly the richer of the two islands , being eclipsed by St Kitts in economic importance . Alexander Hamilton was born on Nevis in 1755 or 1757.
As Britain became embroiled in American Revolutionary War , the French decided to use the opportunity to Siege of Brimstone Hill re-capture St Kitts in 1782 ; however St Kitts was given back and recognised as British territory in the Treaty of Paris ( 1783 ) .
The African slave trade was terminated within the British Empire in 1807 , and slavery outlawed completely in 1834 . A four-year `` apprenticeship '' period followed for each slave , in which they worked for their former owners for wages . On Nevis 8,815 slaves were freed in this way , while St. Kitts had 19,780 freed .
Saint Kitts and Nevis , along with Anguilla , were federated in 1882 . In the first few decades of the 20th century economic hardship and lack of opportunities led to the growth of a labour movement ; the Great Depression led sugar workers to go on strike in 1935 . The 1940s saw the founding of the Saint Kitts and Nevis Labour Party St Kitts-Nevis-Anguilla Labour Party ( later renamed the Saint Kitts and Nevis Labour Party , or SKNLP ) under Robert Llewellyn Bradshaw . Bradshaw later became Chief Minister and then Premier of the colony from 1966 to 1978 ; he sought to gradually bring the sugar-based economy under greater state control . The more conservative-leaning People 's Action Movement party ( PAM ) was founded in 1965.
After a brief period as part of the West Indies Federation ( 195862 ) , the islands became an Saint Kitts-Nevis-Anguilla with full internal autonomy in 1967 . Both Nevis and Anguilla were unhappy at St Kitts ' domination of the federation , with Anguilla unilaterally declaring independence in 1967 . In 1971 Britain resumed full control of Anguilla and it was formally separated in 1980 . Attention then focused on Nevis , with the Nevis Reformation Party seeking to safeguard the smaller island 's interests in any future independent state . Eventually it was agreed that the island would have a degree of autonomy with its own Premier of Nevis and Nevis Island Assembly , as well as the constitutionally-protected right to unilaterally secede if a referendum on independence resulted in a two-thirds majority in favour . St Kitts and Nevis achieved full independence on 19 September 1983 . Kennedy Simmonds of the PAM , Premier since 1980 , duly became the country 's first List of Prime Ministers of Saint Kitts and Nevis . St Kitts and Nevis opted to remain within the British Commonwealth , retaining Queen Elizabeth as Monarchy of St Kitts and Nevis , represented locally by a Governor-General of Saint Kitts and Nevis Governor-General .
===Post independence era===
Kennedy Simmonds went on to win elections in 1984 Saint Kitts and Nevis general election , 1989 Saint Kitts and Nevis general election and 1993 Saint Kitts and Nevis general election , before being unseated when the SKNLP returned to power in 1995 under Denzil Douglas .
In Nevis , growing discontent with their perceived marginalisation within the federation led to a Nevis independence referendum , 1998 from St. Kitts in 1998 , which though resulting a 62 % vote to secede , fell short of the required two-thirds majority to be legally enacted .
In late-September 1998 , Hurricane Georges caused approximately $ 458,000,000 in damages and limited GDP growth for the year and beyond . Meanwhile , the sugar industry , in decline for years and propped up only by government subsidies , was closed completely in 2005.
The 2015 Saint Kitts and Nevis general election was won by Timothy Harris and his recently formed People 's Labour Party ( Saint Kitts and Nevis ) People 's Labour Party , with backing from the PAM and the Nevis-based Concerned Citizens ' Movement under the 'Team Unity ( Saint Kitts and Nevis ) ' banner .

== Economy ==
Saint Kitts and Nevis is a twin-island federation whose economy is characterised by its dominant tourism , agriculture , and light manufacturing industries . Sugar was the primary export from the 1940s on , but rising production costs , low world market prices , and the government 's efforts to reduce dependence on it have led to a growing diversification of the agricultural sector . In 2005 , the government decided to close down the state-owned sugar company , which had experienced losses and was a significant contributor to the fiscal deficit .
St. Kitts and Nevis is heavily dependent upon tourism to drive its economy , a sector which has expanded significantly since the 1970s . In 2009 there were 587,479 arrivals to Saint Kitts compared to 379,473 in 2007 , an increase of just under 40 % in a two-year period , however the tourist sector decreased during the Global financial crisis and has only recently returned to pre-crash levels . In recent years the government has sought to diversify the economy via agriculture , tourism , export-oriented manufacturing , and offshore banking .
In July 2015 , St Kitts & Nevis and the Republic of Ireland signed a tax agreement to `` promote international co-operation in tax matters through exchange of information .

St. Kitts allows Alien ( law ) to obtain the status of St. Kitts citizen by means of a government sponsored investment programme called Citizenship-by-Investment . Established in 1984 , St. Kitts ' citizenship programme is the oldest prevailing economic citizenship programme of this kind in the world . However , while the programme is the oldest in the world , it only catapulted in 2006 when Henley & Partners , a global citizenship advisory firm , became involved in the restructuring of the programme to incorporate donations to the country 's sugar industry .
Citizenship-by-Investment Programmes have been criticised by some researchers due to the risks of corruption , money laundering and tax evasion . According to the official website of St. Kitts ' Citizenship-by-Investment Programme they offer multiple benefits : `` When you acquire citizenship under the St. Kitts & Nevis citizenship programme , you and your family enjoy full citizenship for life , which can be passed on to future generations by descent . As citizens of St. Kitts & Nevis , you and your family are issued with Saint Kitts and Nevis passport which allow visa-free travel to Visa requirements for Saint Kitts and Nevis citizens and territories worldwide , including all of the EU .

Each candidate must go through several legal steps and make a qualifying investment into the country and should complete certain legal requirements to qualify for citizenship under the investment programme . There is a minimum investment that has to be made by the applicant , in either an approved real estate or in the Sugar Industry Diversification Foundation ( a public charity ) , to qualify for the economic citizenship of St. Kitts and Nevis .

Bhutan ( ;  Druk Yul , ) , officially known as the Kingdom of Bhutan (  Druk Gyal Khap ) , is a landlocked country in the Eastern Himalayas . It is bordered by China to the north and India to the south . Nepal and Bangladesh are located in proximity to Bhutan but do not share a land border . The country has a population of over 754,000 and a territory of 38,394 square kilometers ( 14,824 sq mi ) which ranks List of countries and dependencies by area in terms of land area . Bhutan is a constitutional monarchy with Mahayana Buddhism as the state religion .
The subalpine Himalayan mountains in the north rise from the country 's lush subtropical plains in the south . In the Bhutanese Himalayas , there are peaks higher than above sea level . Gangkhar Puensum is Bhutan 's highest peak and may also be the highest unclimbed mountain in the world . The wildlife of Bhutan is notable for its diversity , including the Himalayan takin . The largest city in Bhutan is the capital Thimphu .
Bhutan and neighboring Tibet experienced the spread of Buddhism which originated in the Indian subcontinent during the lifetime of Gautama Buddha . In the first millennium , the Vajrayana school of Buddhism spread to Bhutan from the southern Pala Empire of Bengal . Tibet , Bhutan , Sikkim and parts of Nepal became the vestiges of the Mahayana schools amid the decline of Buddhism in India . Bhutan also came under the influence of the Tibetan Empire . During the 16th-century , Ngawang Namgyal unified the valleys of Bhutan into a single state . Namgyal defeated three Tibetan invasions , subjugated rival religious schools , codified the Tsa Yig legal system , and established a government of theocratic and civil administrators . Namgyal became the first Zhabdrung Rinpoche and his successors acted as the spiritual leaders of Bhutan like the Dalai Lama in Tibet . During the 17th century , Bhutan controlled large parts of northeast India , Sikkim and Nepal ; it also wielded significant influence in Cooch Behar State . Bhutan ceded the Bengal Duars to British India during the Bhutan War in the 19th century . The House of Wangchuck emerged as the monarchy and pursued closer ties with the British Empire in the subcontinent . In 1910 , a Treaty of Punakha guaranteed British advice in Foreign relations of Bhutan in exchange for internal autonomy in Bhutan . The arrangement continued under a new treaty with India in 1949 in which both countries recognized each other 's sovereignty . Bhutan joined the United Nations in 1971 . It has since expanded relations with 55 countries , including Bangladesh , Israel , Kuwait , Brazil , Japan , Thailand , and Turkey ; as well as the European Union . While dependent on the Indian Military Training Team , Bhutan maintains its own Royal Bhutan Army .
The Constitution of Bhutan establishes a parliamentary government with an elected National Assembly of Bhutan and a National Council of Bhutan . Bhutan is a founding member of the South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation ( SAARC ) . In 2020 , Bhutan ranked third in South Asia after Sri Lanka and the Maldives in the Human Development Index . Bhutan is also a member of the Climate Vulnerable Forum , the Non-Aligned Movement , BIMSTEC , the International Monetary Fund , the World Bank , UNESCO and the World Health Organization ( WHO ) . Bhutan ranked first in SAARC in Index of Economic Freedom , Ease of doing business index , Global Peace Index and Corruption Perceptions Index in 2016 . Bhutan has one of the largest water reserves for [ in the world . Melting glacier ] s caused by [ [ climate change are a growing concern in Bhutan .
==Etymology==
The precise etymology of `` Bhutan '' is unknown , although it is likely to derive from the Old Tibetan endonym `` Bd '' for Tibet . Traditionally , it is taken to be a transcription of the Sanskrit Bhoa-anta `` end of Tibet '' , a reference to Bhutan 's position as the southern extremity of the Tibetan plateau and culture .
Since the 17th century , Bhutan 's official name has been Druk yul ( literally , `` country of the Drukpa Lineage '' or `` the Land of the Thunder Dragon , '' a reference to the country 's dominant Buddhist sect ) ; `` Bhutan '' appears only in English-language official correspondence . The terms for the Kings of Bhutan , Druk Gyalpo ( `` Dragon King '' ) , and the Bhutanese endonym Drukpa , `` Dragon people , '' are similarly derived .
Names similar to Bhutanincluding Bohtan , Buhtan , Bottanthis , Bottan and Bottanterbegan to appear in Europe around the 1580s . Jean-Baptiste Tavernier 's 1676 Six Voyages is the first to record the name Boutan . However , these names seem to have referred not to modern Bhutan but to the Tibet ( 191251 ) . The modern distinction between the two did not begin until well into the Scottish explorer George Bogle ( diplomat ) 's 1774 expedition . Realizing the differences between the two regions , cultures , and states , his final report to the East India Company formally proposed calling the Druk Desi 's kingdom `` Boutan '' and the Panchen Lama 's kingdom `` Tibet '' . The EIC 's surveyor general James Rennell first anglicized the French name as `` Bootan , '' and then popularized the distinction between it and Greater Tibet .
The first time a separate Kingdom of Bhutan appeared on a western map , it did so under its local name `` Broukpa '' . Others include Lho Mon ( `` Dark Southland '' ) , Lho Tsendenjong ( `` Southland of the Cypress '' ) , Lhomen Khazhi ( `` Southland of the Four Approaches '' ) and Lho Menjong ( `` Southland of the medicinal herb '' ) .
==History==
Stone tools , weapons , elephants , and remnants of large stone structures provide evidence that Bhutan was inhabited as early as 2000 BC , although there are no existing records from that time . Historians have theorized that the state of Lhomon ( literally , `` southern darkness '' ) , or Monyul ( `` Dark Land '' , a reference to the Monpa people , an ethnic group in Bhutan & Arunachal Pradesh ) may have existed between 500 BC and AD 600 . The names Lhomon Tsendenjong ( Sandalwood Country ) , and Lhomon Khashi , or Southern Mon ( country of four approaches ) , have been found in ancient Bhutanese and Tibetan chronicles .
Buddhism was first introduced to Bhutan in the 7th century AD . Tibetan king Songtsn Gampo ( reigned 627649 ) , a convert to Buddhism , who actually had extended the Tibetan Empire into Sikkim and Bhutan , ordered the construction of two Buddhist temples , at Bumthang ( town ) in central Bhutan and at Kyichu ( near Paro , Bhutan ) in the Paro Valley . Buddhism was propagated in earnest in 746 under King Sindhu Rja ( also Knjom ; Sendha Gyab ; Chakhar Gyalpo ) , an exiled Indian people king who had established a government in Bumthang at Chakhar Gutho Palace .
Much of early Bhutanese history is unclear because most of the records were destroyed when fire ravaged the ancient capital , Punakha , in 1827 . By the 10th century , Bhutan 's political development was heavily influenced by its religious history . Various subsects of Buddhism emerged that were patronized by the various Mongols warlords .
Bhutan may have been influenced by the Yuan dynasty with which it shares various cultural and religious similarities .
After the decline of the Yuan dynasty in the 14th century , these subsects vied with each other for supremacy in the political and religious landscape , eventually leading to the ascendancy of the Drukpa Lineage by the 16th century .
Locally , Bhutan has been known by many names . The earliest Western record of Bhutan , the 1627 Relao of the Kingdom of Portugal Jesuits Estvo Cacella and Joo Cabral , records its name variously as Cambirasi ( among the Cooch Behar Stateis ) , Potente , and Mon ( an endonym for southern Tibet ) . Until the early 17th century , Bhutan existed as a patchwork of minor warring fiefdoms , when the area was unified by the Tibetan lama and military leader Ngawang Namgyal , who had fled religious persecution in Tibet . To defend the country against intermittent Tibetan forays , Namgyal built a network of impregnable dzong architecture or fortresses , and promulgation the Tsa Yig , a code of law that helped to bring local lords under centralized control . Many such dzong still exist and are active centers of religion and district administration . Portuguese people Society of Jesus Estvo Cacella and Joo Cabral were the first recorded Europeans to visit Bhutan in 1627 , on their way to Tibet . They met Zhabdrung Ngawang Namgyal , presented him with firearms , gunpowder and a telescope , and offered him their services in the war against Tibet , but the Zhabdrung declined the offer . After a stay of nearly eight months Cacella wrote a long letter from the Chagri Monastery reporting on his travels . This is a rare extant report of the Zhabdrung .
When Ngawang Namgyal died in 1651 , his passing was kept secret for 54 years . After a period of consolidation , Bhutan lapsed into internal conflict . In 1711 Bhutan went to war against the Raja of the kingdom of Cooch Behar State in the south . During the chaos that followed , the Tibetans unsuccessfully attacked Bhutan in 1714.
In the 18th century , the Bhutanese invaded and occupied the kingdom of Koch Bihar . In 1772 , the Maharaja of Koch Bihar appealed to the British East India Company which assisted by ousting the Bhutanese and later in attacking Bhutan itself in 1774 . A peace treaty was signed in which Bhutan agreed to retreat to its pre-1730 borders . However , the peace was tenuous , and border skirmishes with the British India were to continue for the next hundred years . The skirmishes eventually led to the Duar War ( 186465 ) , a confrontation for control of the Bengal Duars . After Bhutan lost the war , the Treaty of Sinchula was signed between British India and Bhutan . As part of the war reparations , the Duars were ceded to the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland in exchange for a rent of Rs . 50,000 . The treaty ended all hostilities between British India and Bhutan .
During the 1870s , power struggles between the rival valleys of Paro , Bhutan and Tongsa led to civil war in Bhutan , eventually leading to the ascendancy of Ugyen Wangchuck , the Penlop of Trongsa ( governor ) of Trongsa District . From his power base in central Bhutan , Ugyen Wangchuck defeated his political enemies and united the country following several civil wars and rebellions during 188285 .
In 1907 , an epochal year for the country , Ugyen Wangchuck was unanimously chosen as the hereditary king of the country by the Lhengye Tshog of leading Buddhist monks , government officials , and heads of important families , with the firm petition made by Gongzim Ugyen Dorji . John Claude White , British Political Agent in Bhutan , took photographs of the ceremony . The British government promptly recognized the new monarchy , and in 1910 Bhutan signed the Treaty of Punakha , a subsidiary alliance which gave the British control of Bhutan 's foreign affairs and meant that Bhutan was treated as an Indian princely state . This had little real effect , given Bhutan 's historical reticence , and also did not appear to affect Bhutan 's traditional relations with Tibet . After the new Dominion of India gained Independence of India from the United Kingdom on 15 August 1947 , Bhutan became one of the first countries to recognize India 's independence . On 8 August 1949 , a treaty similar to that of 1910 , in which Britain had gained power over Bhutan 's foreign relations , was signed with the newly independent India .
In 1953 , King Jigme Dorji Wangchuck established the country 's legislature  a 130-member National Assembly  to promote a more democratic form of governance . In 1965 , he set up a Royal Advisory Council , and in 1968 he formed a Cabinet . In 1971 , Bhutan was admitted to the United Nations , having held observer status for three years . In July 1972 , Jigme Singye Wangchuck ascended to the throne at the age of sixteen after the death of his father , Dorji Wangchuck .
Bhutan 's sixth Five-Year Plan ( 198792 ) included a policy of 'one nation , one people ' and introduced a code of traditional Drukpa dress and etiquette called Driglam Namzhag . The dress element of this code required all citizens to wear the gho ( a knee-length robe for men ) and the kira ( an ankle-length dress for women ) . A central plank of the Bhutanese government 's policy since the late 1980s has been to strengthen the role and status of Dzongkha in national life . At the beginning of the school year in March 1990 the teaching of Nepali language spoken by ethnic Lhotshampas in southern Bhutan was discontinued and all Nepali curricular materials disappeared from Bhutanese schools . In 1988 Bhutan conducted a census in southern Bhutan . Each family was required to present census workers with a tax receipt from the year 1958no earlier , no lateror with a certificate of origin , which had to be obtained from one  s place of birth , to prove that they were indeed Bhutanese citizens . Previously issued citizenship cards were no longer accepted as proof of citizenship . Very few Lhotshampa people were classified as citizens . Alarmed by these measures , many began to protest for civil and cultural rights . As protests swept across southern Bhutan , the government in turn increased its resistance . People present at protests were labeled  anti-national terrorists  . After the demonstrations , the Bhutanese army and police began the task of identifying participants and supporters . They were arrested and questioned , and often beaten , tortured and held for months without trial . Soon the Bhutanese government arbitrarily reported that its census operations had detected the presence in southern Bhutan of over 100,000 `` illegal immigrants '' almost all of them Lhotshampas . The census operations , thus , quickly became a tool for the identification , dispossession eviction and banishment of dissidents , the wealthy , the educated , and various other categories of Lhotshampa citizen . Military and other security forces were deployed for forceful deportations of between 80,000 - 100 , 000 Lhotshampas using widespread violence , torture , rape and killing . The evicted Lhotshampas became refugees in camps in southern Nepal . Since 2008 , many Western world , such as Canada , Norway , the United Kingdom , Australia , and the United States , have allowed resettlement of majority of the Lhotshampa refugees .
===Political reform and modernization===
Bhutan 's political system has recently changed from an absolute monarchy to a constitutional monarchy . King Jigme Singye Wangchuck transferred most of his administrative powers to the Council of Cabinet Ministers and allowed for impeachment of the King by a two-thirds majority of the National Assembly .
In 1999 , the government lifted a ban on television and internet , making Bhutan one of the last countries to introduce television . In his speech , the King said that television was a critical step to the modernization of Bhutan as well as a major contributor to the country 's gross national happiness , but warned that the `` misuse '' of this new technology could erode traditional Bhutanese values .
A new constitution was presented in early 2005 . In December 2005 , Wangchuck announced that he would abdicate the throne in his son 's favour in 2008 . On 14 December 2006 , he announced that he would be abdicating immediately . This was followed by the first national Elections in Bhutan in Bhutanese National Council election , 20072008 and 2008 Bhutanese general election .
On 6 November 2008 , 28-year-old Jigme Khesar Namgyel Wangchuck was crowned king .
==Geography==
Bhutan is on the southern slopes of the eastern Himalayas , landlocked between the Tibet Autonomous Region of China to the north and the Indian states of Sikkim , West Bengal , Assam to west and south and the Indian state of Arunachal Pradesh to the east . It lies between latitudes 26th parallel north 26N and 29th parallel north 29N , and longitudes 88th meridian east 88E and 93rd meridian east 93E . The land consists mostly of steep and high mountains of Bhutan crisscrossed by a network of swift rivers that form deep valleys before draining into the Indian plains . Elevation rises from in the southern foothills to more than . This great geographical diversity combined with equally diverse climate conditions contributes to Bhutan 's outstanding range of biodiversity and ecosystems .
Bhutan 's northern region consists of an arc of Eastern Himalayan alpine shrub and meadows reaching up to glaciated mountain peaks with an extremely cold climate at the highest elevations . Most peaks in the north are over above sea level ; the highest point is -tall Gangkhar Puensum , which has the distinction of being the [ unclimbed mountain ] in the world . The lowest point , at , is in the valley of Drangme Chhu , where the river crosses the border with India . Watered by snow-fed rivers , alpine valleys in this region provide pasture for livestock , tended by a sparse population of migratory shepherds .
The Black Mountains ( Bhutan ) in Bhutan 's central region form a watershed between two major river systems : the Mo Chhu and the Drangme Chhu . Peaks in the Black Mountains range between above sea level , and fast-flowing rivers have carved out deep gorges in the lower mountain areas . The forests of the central Bhutan mountains consist of Eastern Himalayan subalpine conifer forests in higher elevations and Eastern Himalayan broadleaf forests in lower elevations . Woodlands of the central region provide most of Bhutan 's forest production . The Torsa River , Raidak , Sankosh , and Manas River are Bhutan 's main rivers , flowing through this region . Most of the population lives in the central highlands .
In the south , the Shiwalik Hills are covered with dense Himalayan subtropical broadleaf forests , alluvial lowland river valleys , and mountains up to around above sea level . The foothills descend into the subtropical Duars Plain , which is the eponymous gateway to strategic mountain passes ( also known as dwars or dooars ; literally , `` doors '' in Assamese language , Bengali language , Maithili language , Bhojpuri language , and Magahi language languages. ) . Most of the Duars is in India , but a -wide strip extends into Bhutan . The Bhutan Duars is divided into two parts , the northern and southern Duars
The northern Duars , which abut the Himalayan foothills , have rugged , sloping terrain and dry , porous soil with dense vegetation and abundant wildlife . The southern Duars has moderately fertile soil , heavy savanna grass , dense , mixed jungle , and freshwater springs . Mountain rivers , fed by melting snow or monsoon rains , empty into the Brahmaputra River in India . Data released by the Ministry of Agriculture showed that the country had a forest cover of 64 % as of October 2005.

=== Climate ===
Bhutan 's climate varies with elevation , from subtropical in the south to temperate climate in the highlands and polar climate polar-type climate with year-round snow in the north . Bhutan experiences five distinct seasons : summer , monsoon , autumn , winter and spring . Western Bhutan has the heavier monsoon rains ; southern Bhutan has hot humid summers and cool winters ; central and eastern Bhutan are temperate and drier than the west with warm summers and cool winters .
==Biodiversity==
Bhutan signed the Rio Convention on Biological Diversity on 11 June 1992 , and became a party to the convention on 25 August 1995 . It has subsequently produced a Biodiversity Action Plan , with two revisions , the most recent of which was received by the convention on 4 February 2010.
===Animals===
Bhutan has a rich primate life , with rare species such as the golden langur . A variant Assamese macaque has also been recorded , which is regarded by some authorities as a new species , Macaca munzala .
The Bengal tiger , clouded leopard , [ hare ] and the sloth bear live in the tropical lowland and hardwood forests in the south . In the temperate zone , grey langur , tiger , goral and serow are found in mixed conifer , broadleaf and pine forests . Fruit-bearing trees and bamboo provide habitat for the Himalayan black bear , red panda , squirrel , sambar ( deer ) , Sus ( genus ) and barking deer . The alpine habitats of the great Himalayan range in the north are home to the snow leopard , blue sheep , marmot , Tibetan wolf , antelope , Himalayan musk deer and the takin , Bhutan 's national animal . The endangered wild water buffalo occurs in southern Bhutan , although in small numbers .
More than 770 species of bird have been recorded in Bhutan . The globally endangered white-winged duck has been added recently in 2006 to Bhutan 's bird list .
===Plants===
More than 5,400 species of plants are found in Bhutan , including Pedicularis cacuminidenta . Fungi form a key part of Bhutanese ecosystems , with mycorrhizal species providing forest trees with mineral nutrients necessary for growth , and with wood decay and litter decomposing species playing an important role in natural recycling .
===Conservation===
The Eastern Himalayas have been identified as a global biodiversity hotspot and counted among the 234 globally outstanding ecoregions of the world in a comprehensive analysis of global biodiversity undertaken by World Wide Fund for Nature between 1995 and 1997.
According to the Swiss-based International Union for Conservation of Nature , Bhutan is viewed as a model for proactive Conservation movement initiatives . The Kingdom has received international acclaim for its commitment to the maintenance of its biodiversity . This is reflected in the decision to maintain at least sixty percent of the land area under forest cover , to designate more than 40 % of its territory as national parks , reserves and other protected areas , and most recently to identify a further nine percent of land area as biodiversity corridors linking the protected areas . All of Bhutan 's protected land is connected to one another through a vast network of biological corridors , allowing animals to migrate freely throughout the country . Environmental conservation has been placed at the core of the nation 's development strategy , the middle path . It is not treated as a sector but rather as a set of concerns that must be mainstreamed in Bhutan 's overall approach to development planning and to be buttressed by the force of law . The country 's constitution mentions environment standards in multiple sections .
===Environmental issues===
Although Bhutan 's natural heritage is still largely intact , the government has said that it can not be taken for granted and that conservation of the natural environment must be considered one of the challenges that will need to be addressed in the years ahead . Nearly 56.3 % of all Bhutanese are involved with agriculture , forestry or conservation . The government aims to promote conservation as part of its plan to target Gross National Happiness . It currently has net negative greenhouse gas emissions because the small amount of pollution it creates is absorbed by the forests that cover most of the country . While the entire country collectively produces of carbon dioxide a year , the immense forest covering 72 % of the country acts as a carbon sink , absorbing more than four million tons of carbon dioxide every year . Bhutan had a 2018 Forest Landscape Integrity Index mean score of 8.85/10 , ranking it 16th globally out of 172 countries .
Bhutan has a number of progressive environmental policies that have caused the head of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change to call it an `` inspiration and role model for the world on how economies and different countries can address climate change while at the same time improving the life of the citizen . '' For example , electric cars have been pushed in the country and make up a tenth of all cars . Because the country gets most of its energy from [ power ] , it does not emit significant greenhouse gases for energy production .
Pressures on the natural environment , fueled by a complex array of forces , are already evident . They include : population pressures , agricultural modernization , poaching , hydro-power development , mineral extraction , industrialization , urbanization , sewage and waste disposal , tourism , competition for available land , road construction and the provision of other physical infrastructure associated with social and economic development .
In practice , the overlap of these extensive protected lands with populated areas has led to mutual habitat encroachment . Protected wildlife has entered agricultural areas , trampling crops and killing livestock . In response , Bhutan has implemented an insurance scheme , begun constructing solar powered alarm fences , watch towers , and search lights , and has provided fodder and salt licks outside human settlement areas to encourage animals to stay away .
The huge market value of the Ophiocordyceps sinensis fungus crop collected from the wild has also resulted in unsustainable exploitation which is proving very difficult to regulate .
Bhutan has enforced a plastic ban rule from 1 April 2019 , where plastic bags were replaced by alternative bags made of jute and other biodegradable material .
==Government and politics==
Bhutan is a constitutional monarchy with a parliamentary form of government . The reigning monarch is Jigme Khesar Namgyel Wangchuck . The current Prime Minister of Bhutan is Lotay Tshering , leader of the Druk Nyamrup Tshogpa Party . Bhutan 's democratic transition in 2008 is seen as an evolution of its social contract with the monarchy since 1907 . In 2019 , Bhutan was classified in the Democracy Index as a [ regime ] alongside regional neighbors Nepal and Bangladesh . Minorities are increasingly represented in Bhutan 's government since 2008 , including in the cabinet , parliament and local government .
The Druk Gyalpo ( Dragon King ) is the [ of state ] . The political system grants universal suffrage . It consists of the National Council ( Bhutan ) , an upper house with 25 elected members ; and the National Assembly ( Bhutan ) with 47 elected lawmakers from List of political parties in Bhutan .
Executive power is exercised by the Council of Ministers ( Bhutan ) led by the Prime Minister of Bhutan . Legislative power is vested in both the government and the National Assembly ( Bhutan ) . Judicial power is vested in the courts . The legal system originates from the semi-theocratic Tsa Yig code , and was influenced by English common law during the 20th century . The chief justice is the administrative head of the judiciary .
===Political culture===
The first 2008 Bhutanese general election for the National Assembly ( Bhutan ) were held on 24 March 2008 . The chief contestants were the Bhutan Peace and Prosperity Party ( DPT ) led by Jigme Thinley and the People 's Democratic Party ( Bhutan ) People 's Democratic Party ( PDP ) led by Sangay Ngedup . The DPT won the elections , taking 45 out of 47 seats . Jigme Thinley served as Prime Minister from 2008 to 2013.
The People 's Democratic Party ( Bhutan ) People 's Democratic Party came to power in the 2013 Bhutanese National Assembly election . It won 32 seats and 54.88 % of the vote . PDP leader Tshering Tobgay served as Prime Minister from 2013 to 2018.
Druk Nyamrup Tshogpa won the largest number of seats in the 2018 Bhutanese National Assembly election , bringing Lotay Tshering to premiership and Druk Nyamrup Tshogpa into the government for the first time .
===Foreign relations===
In the early 20th century , Bhutan became a de facto protectorate of the British Empire under the Treaty of Punakha in 1910 . British protection guarded Bhutan from an Tibet ( 1912-1951 ) and Qing China . In the aftermath of the Chinese Communist Revolution , Bhutan signed a friendship treaty with the newly independent Dominion of India in 1949 . Its concerns were exacerbated after the Incorporation of Tibet into the People 's Republic of China .
Relations with Nepal remained strained due to Bhutanese refugees . Bhutan joined the United Nations in 1971 . It was the first country to recognize Bangladesh 's Provisional Government of Bangladesh in 1971 . It became a founding member of the South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation ( SAARC ) in 1985 . The country is a member of 150 international organizations , including the Bay of Bengal Initiative , BBIN , World Bank , the International Monetary Fund and the Group of 77.
Bhutan maintains strong economic , strategic , and military relations with India . In 2007 , Bhutan and India revised their friendship treaty , which clarified Bhutan 's full control of its foreign relations , including its border with China . Bhutan has very warm relations with Japan , which provides significant development assistance . The Bhutanese royals were hosted by the Japanese imperial family during a state visit in 2011 . Japan is also helping Bhutan cope with glacial floods through developing an early warning system . Bhutan enjoys strong political and diplomatic relations with Bangladesh . The Bhutanese king was the guest of honor during celebrations of the 40th anniversary of Bangladesh 's independence . A 2014 joint statement by the prime ministers of both countries announced cooperation in areas of hydropower , river management and climate change mitigation . Bangladesh and Bhutan signed a preferential trade agreement in 2020 with provisions for free trade .
Bhutan has diplomatic relations with 53 countries and the European Union and has missions in India , Bangladesh , Thailand , Kuwait and Belgium . It has two UN missions , one in New York and one in Geneva . Only India , Bangladesh and Kuwait have residential embassies in Bhutan . Other countries maintain informal diplomatic contact via their embassies in New Delhi and Dhaka . Bhutan maintains formal foreign relations of Bhutan with several Asian and European nations , Canada , and Brazil . Other countries , BhutanUnited States relations and the United Kingdom , have no formal diplomatic relations with Bhutan but maintain informal contact through their respective embassies in New Delhi and the Bhutanese honorary consulate in Washington , DC . The United Kingdom has an honorary consul resident in Thimphu.The latest country with which Bhutan has established diplomatic relations is Israel , on 12 December 2020.
By long-standing agreement , Indian and Bhutanese citizens may travel to each other 's countries without a Bhutanese passport or visa , but must still have their national identity cards . Bhutanese citizens may also work in India without legal restriction . Bhutan does not have formal diplomatic ties with China , but exchanges of visits at various levels between them have significantly increased in recent times . The first bilateral agreement between China and Bhutan was signed in 1998 and Bhutan has also set up honorary consulates in the Special administrative regions of the People 's Republic of China of Hong Kong and Macau . Bhutan 's border with China is largely not demarcated and thus disputed in some places . Approximately remain under discussion between China and Bhutan .
On 13 November 2005 , Chinese soldiers crossed into the disputed territories between China and Bhutan and began building roads and bridges . Bhutanese Foreign Minister Khandu Wangchuk took up the matter with Chinese authorities after the issue was raised in the Bhutanese parliament . In response , Foreign Ministry spokesman Qin Gang of the People 's Republic of China said that the border remains in dispute and that the two sides are continuing to work for a peaceful and cordial resolution of the dispute , denying that the presence of soldiers in the area was an attempt to forcibly occupy it . An Indian intelligence officer said that a Chinese delegation in Bhutan told the Bhutanese they were `` overreacting '' . The Bhutanese newspaper Kuensel said that China might use the roads to further Chinese claims along the border .
In February 2007 the Indo-Bhutan Friendship Treaty was substantially revised . Whereas the Treaty of 1949 , Article 2 stated : `` The Government of India undertakes to exercise no interference in the internal administration of Bhutan . On its part the Government of Bhutan agrees to be guided by the advice of the Government of India in regard to its external relations , '' the revised treaty now states `` In keeping with the abiding ties of close friendship and cooperation between Bhutan and India , the Government of the Kingdom of Bhutan and the Government of the Republic of India shall cooperate closely with each other on issues relating to their national interests . Neither government shall allow the use of its territory for activities harmful to the national security and interest of the other . '' The revised treaty also includes this preamble : `` Reaffirming their respect for each other 's independence , sovereignty and territorial integrity '' , an element absent in the earlier version . The Indo-Bhutan Friendship Treaty of 2007 clarifies Bhutan 's status as an independent and sovereign nation .
Bhutan opposed the Russian annexation of Crimea in United Nations General Assembly Resolution 68/262 .
=== Military ===
The Royal Bhutan Army is Bhutan 's military service . It includes the Royal Bodyguard of Bhutan and the Royal Bhutan Police . Membership is voluntary and the minimum age for recruitment is 18 . The standing army numbers about 16,000 and is trained by the Indian Army . It has an annual budget of about US $ 13.7 ; million ( 1.8 percent of Gross domestic product ) . As a landlocked country , Bhutan has no navy . It also has no air force or army aviation corps . The Army relies on the Eastern Air Command ( India ) of the Indian Air Force for air assistance .
===Human rights===
Bhutan is ranked as `` Partly Free '' by Freedom House . Bhutan 's parliament decriminalized homosexuality in 2020.
Women in Bhutan tend to be less active in politics than men due to customs and aspects of Bhutan 's culture that dictate a woman 's role in the household . This leads to a limitation of their voices in government . Bhutan has made steps toward gender equality by enrolling more girls in school as well as creating the `` National Commission for Women and Children '' ( NCWC ) in 2004 . This program was created to promote and protect women 's and children 's rights . Bhutan also elected its first female Dzongda , equivalent to a District Attorney , in 2012 , and its first female minister in 2013 . Minister Dorji Choden , chair for the National Commission for Women and Children , believes that the aforementioned program can be used to  promote women into more leadership roles  which can then lead women to take on more active roles in their society . Overall there has also been a gradual increase in women in power with a 68 % increase in women representation from 2011 to 2016.
====Nepali-speaking minority====
Starting in the 1980s , Bhutan 's minority population groups of Nepali language speakers ( `` Lhotshampa '' ) , in Southern Bhutan , were subjected to political persecution by the Bhutanese government as part of their Bhutanization ( termed One Nation , One People ) policy to exert cultural and political dominance of the majority Ngalop people population . In 1977 followed by in 1985 Bhutan 's government enacted legislations against the Lhotshampa ethnic minority to tighten citizenship criteria and introducing provisions for denationalization of Lhotshampas who held citizenship . The government enforced uniformity in religion , dress , and language to enforce preeminence of Ngalop people culture as the national culture of the country . The Lhotshampas started demonstrations in protest of such discriminatory laws . Such political demonstrations were forcefully suppressed by Bhutanese security forces . Members of Bhutanese police and army imprisoned , tortured and raped many who were politically active in such demonstrations . Lhotshampas were arrested , their houses burned and then expelled from the country and their property confiscated without compensation .
A harassment campaign escalating in the early 1990s ensued ; this was followed by deportations by Bhutanese security forces who engaged in gross human rights violations including torture and rape of political demonstrators . According to the UNHCR , more than 107,000 Bhutanese refugees living in seven camps in eastern Nepal have been documented . After many years in refugee camps , many inhabitants are now moving to other host nations such as Canada , Norway , the UK , Australia , and the US as refugees . The US admitted 60,773 refugees from fiscal years 2008 to 2012.
The Government of Nepal refused to assimilate the Bhutanese refugees ( Lhotshampas ) and did not allow a legal path to citizenship , so they were left stateless . Careful scrutiny has been used to prevent their relatives from getting ID cards and voting rights . Bhutan considers political parties associated with these refugees to be illegal and terrorist . Human rights groups initially claimed the government interfered with individual rights by requiring all citizens , including ethnic minority members , to wear the traditional dress of the ethnic majority in public places . The government strictly enforced this law in Buddhist religious buildings , government offices , schools , official functions , and public ceremonies .
====Freedom of religion====
The kingdom has a history of Freedom of religion in Bhutan , which critics denounce as a violation of freedom of religion and a policy of ethnic cleansing . Starting in the 1980s , Bhutan adopted a policy of `` One Nation One People '' to exert cultural ( in language , dress and religion ) and political dominance of the majority Ngalop people people . The policy manifested in banning of teaching of Nepali language language in schools and denial of citizenship to those who were not able to prove officially issued land holding title prior to 1950 specifically targeting Lhotshampa representing one-third of the population at the time . This resulted in widespread unrest and political demonstrations . In 1988 , the Bhutanese authorities carried out a special census in southern Bhutan , region of high Lhotshampa population , resulting in mass denationalization of Lhotshampas , followed by forcible deportation of 107,000 Lhotshampas , approximately one-sixth of the total population at the time . Those who had been granted citizenship by the Bhutanese Citizenship Act 1958 were stripped of their citizenship . Members of Bhutanese police and army were involved in burning of Lhotshampa houses , land confiscation and other widespread human rights abuses including arrest , torture and rape of Lhotshampas involved in political protests . Following forcible deportation from Bhutan , Lhotshampas spent almost two decades in refugee camps in Nepal and were resettled in various western countries such as the United States between 20072012 .
===Political divisions===
Bhutan is divided into twenty Dzongkhag ( districts ) , administered by a body called the Dzongkhag Tshogdu . In certain thromdes ( urban municipalities ) , a further municipal administration is directly subordinate to the Dzongkhag administration . In the vast majority of constituencies , rural Gewogs of Bhutan ( village blocks ) are administered by bodies called the Geog Tshogde .
Thromdes ( municipalities ) elect Thrompons to lead administration , who in turn represent the Thromde in the Dzongkhag Tshogdu . Likewise , geog elect headmen called gups , vice-headmen called mangmis , who also sit on the Dzongkhag Tshogdu , as well as other members of the Geog Tshogde . The basis of electoral constituencies in Bhutan is the chiwog , a subdivision of gewogs delineated by the Election Commission .
==Economy==
Bhutan 's currency is the ngultrum , whose value is Fixed exchange rate to the Indian rupee . The rupee is also accepted as legal tender in the country .
Though Bhutan 's economy is one of the world 's smallest , it has grown rapidly in recent years , by eight percent in 2005 and 14 percent in 2006 . In 2007 , Bhutan had the second-fastest-growing economy in the world , with an annual economic growth rate of 22.4 percent . This was mainly due to the commissioning of the gigantic Tala Hydroelectric Power Station . , Bhutan 's per capita income was US $ 2,420 .
Bhutan 's economy is based on agriculture , forestry , tourism and the sale of [ power ] to India . Agriculture provides the main livelihood for 55.4 percent of the population . Agrarian practices consist largely of subsistence farming and animal husbandry . Handicrafts , particularly weaving and the manufacture of religious art for home altars , are a small cottage industry . A landscape that varies from hilly to ruggedly mountainous has made the building of roads and other infrastructure difficult and expensive .
This , and a lack of access to the sea , has meant that Bhutan has not been able to benefit from significant trading of its produce . Bhutan has no rail transport , though Indian Railways plans to link southern Bhutan to its vast network under an agreement signed in January 2005 . Bhutan and India signed a 'free trade ' accord in 2008 , which additionally allowed Bhutanese imports and exports from third markets to transit India without tariffs . Bhutan had trade relations with the Tibet Autonomous Region of China until 1960 , when it closed its border with China after an influx of refugees .
Access to biocapacity in Bhutan is much higher than world average . In 2016 , Bhutan had 5.0 global hectares of biocapacity per person within its territory , much more than the world average of 1.6 global hectares per person . In 2016 Bhutan used 4.5 global hectares of biocapacity per person - their ecological footprint of consumption . This means they use less biocapacity than Bhutan contains . As a result , Bhutan is running a biocapacity reserve .
The industrial sector is currently in a nascent stage . Although most production comes from cottage industry , larger industries are being encouraged and some industries such as cement , steel , and ferroalloy have been set up . Most development projects , such as road construction , rely on contract labor from neighboring India . Agricultural produce includes rice , chilies , dairy ( some yak , mostly cow ) products , buckwheat , barley , root crops , apples , and citrus and maize at lower elevations . Industries include cement , wood products , processed fruits , alcoholic beverages and calcium carbide .
Bhutan has seen recent growth in the technology sector , in areas such as green tech and consumer Internet/e-commerce . In May 2012 , `` Thimphu TechPark '' was launched in the capital . It incubates startups via the `` Bhutan Innovation and Technology Center '' ( BITC ) .
Incomes of over Ngultrum 100,000 per annum are taxed , but as Bhutan is currently one of the world 's least developed countries , very few wage and salary earners qualify . Bhutan 's inflation rate was estimated at about three percent in 2003 . Bhutan has a gross domestic product of around US $ 5.855 ; billion ( adjusted to purchasing power parity ) , making it the 158th-largest economy in the world . Per capita income ( PPP ) is around $ 7,641 , ranked 144th . Government revenues total $ 407.1 ; million , though expenditures amount to $ 614 ; million . Twenty-five percent of the budget expenditure , however , is financed by India 's Ministry of External Affairs .
Bhutan 's exports , principally electricity , cardamom , gypsum , timber , handicrafts , cement , fruit , precious stones and spices , total 128 ; million ( 2000 est. ) . Imports , however , amount to 164 ; million , leading to a trade deficit . Main items imported include fuel and lubricants , grain , machinery , vehicles , fabrics and rice . Bhutan 's main export partner is India , accounting for 58.6 percent of its export goods . Hong Kong ( 30.1 percent ) and Bangladesh ( 7.3 percent ) are the other two top export partners . As its border with Tibet Autonomous Region is closed , trade between Bhutan and China is now almost non-existent . Bhutan 's import partners include India ( 74.5 percent ) , Japan ( 7.4 percent ) and Sweden ( 3.2 percent ) .
===Agriculture===
The share of the agricultural sector in GDP declined from approximately 55 % in 1985 to 33 % in 2003 . In 2013 the government announced the aspiration that Bhutan will become the first country in the world with 100 percent organic farming . Bhutanese red rice is the country 's most widely known agricultural export , enjoying a market in North America and Europe . Bangladesh is the largest market of Bhutanese apples and Orange ( fruit ) .
Fishing in Bhutan is mainly centered on trout and carp .
===Industry===
The industrial sector accounts for 22 % of the economy . The key manufacturing sectors in Bhutan include production of ferroalloy , cement , metal poles , iron and nonalloy steel products , processed graphite , copper conductors , alcoholic and carbonated beverages , processed fruits , carpets , wood products and furniture .
===Mining===
Bhutan has deposits of numerous minerals . Commercial production includes coal , Dolomite ( rock ) , gypsum , and limestone . The country has proven reserves of beryl , copper , graphite , lead , mica , pyrite , tin , tungsten , and zinc . However , the country 's mineral deposits remain untapped , as it prefers to conserve the environment , rather than to exploit and destroy it for money .
===Energy===
Bhutan 's largest export is hydroelectricity . , it generates about 2,000 watt of hydropower from Himalayan river valleys . The country has a potential to generate 30,000 MW of hydropower . Power is supplied to various states in India . Future projects are being planned with Bangladesh . Hydropower has been the primary focus for the country 's Five-Year Plans of Bhutan five-year plans . , the Tala Hydroelectric Power Station is its largest power plant , with an installed capacity of 1,020 MW . It has received assistance from India , Austria and the Asian Development Bank in developing hydroelectric projects .
Besides hydropower , it is also endowed with significant renewable energy resources such as solar , wind and bioenergy . Technically viable solar energy generation capacity is around 12,000 MW and wind around 760 MW . More than 70 % of its land is under forest cover , which is an immense source of bioenergy in the country .
Bhutan is likely to benefit geopolitically from the global transition to renewable energy and is ranked no . 4 out of 156 nations in the index of geopolitical gains and losses after energy transition ( GeGaLo Index ) .
===Financial sector===
There are Five Commercial Banks in the country and two largest banks are the Bank of Bhutan and the Bhutan National Bank which are based in Thimphu . Other commercial banks are Bhutan Development Bank , T-Bank and Druk Punjab National Bank . The country 's financial sector is also supported by other non-banking Financial Institutions . They are Royal Insurance Corporation of Bhutan ( RICB ) , National Pension and Provident Fund ( NPPF ) , and Bhutan Insurance Limited ( BIL ) . The central bank of the country is the Royal Monetary Authority of Bhutan ( RMA ) . The Royal Securities Exchange of Bhutan is the main stock exchange .
B
The SAARC Development Fund is based in Thimphu .
===Tourism===
In 2014 , Bhutan welcomed 133,480 foreign visitors . Seeking to become a high-value destination , it imposes a daily fee of anywhere between US $ 180 to US $ 290 per day ( or more ) on tourists that covers touring and hotel accommodation . The industry employs 21,000 people and accounts for 1.8 % of GDP . However the Bhutanese goal of attracting high value tourists can be criticized for actually only attracting wealthy tourists and poses the question on whether by definition `` high quality '' actually means `` of wealth '' .
The country currently has no UNESCO World Heritage Sites , but it has eight declared tentative sites for UNESCO inclusion since 2012 . These sites include : Ancient Ruin of Drukgyel Dzong , Bumdelling Wildlife Sanctuary , Dzongs : the centre of temporal and religious authorities ( Punakha Dzong , Wangdue Phodrang Dzong , Paro Dzong , Trongsa Dzong and Dagana Dzong ) , Jigme Dorji National Park ( JDNP ) , Royal Manas National Park ( RMNP ) , Sacred Sites associated with Phajo Drugom Zhigpo and his descendants , Sakteng Wildlife Sanctuary ( SWS ) , and Tamzhing Monastery . Bhutan also has numerous tourist sites that are not included in its UNESCO tentative list . Bhutan has one element , the Mask dance of the drums from Drametse , registered in the UNESCO Intangible Cultural Heritage List .
Bhutan is also well known for mountain adventure trekking and hiking . Jhomolhari Base Camp Trek , Snowman Trek , and Masagang trek are some of the popular treks in Bhutan .
== Transport ==
===Air===
Paro Airport is the only international airport in Bhutan . Yongphulla Airport in Trashigang is a small domestic airport that underwent upgrades through 2010 . Yonphula Domestic Airport was scheduled for completion in January 2010 but , the airport remains closed due to ongoing runway repair . National carrier Druk Air operates flights between Paro Airport and airports in Jakar ( Bumthang Dzongkhag ) and Gelephu ( Sarpang Dzongkhag ) on a weekly basis .
===Road===
The Lateral Road is Bhutan 's primary eastwest corridor , connecting the towns of Phuentsholing in the southwest to Trashigang in the east . Notable settlements that the Lateral Road runs through directly are Wangdue Phodrang and Trongsa . The Lateral Road also has spurs connecting to the capital Thimphu and other population centers such as Paro , Bhutan and Punakha . As with other roads in Bhutan , the Lateral Road presents serious safety concerns due to pavement conditions , sheer drops , hairpin turns , weather and landslides .
Since 2014 , road widening has been a priority across Bhutan , in particular for the north-eastwest highway from Trashigang to Dochula . The widening project is expected to be completed by the end of 2017 and will make road travel across the country substantially faster and more efficient . In addition , it is projected that the improved road conditions will encourage more tourism in the more inaccessible eastern region of Bhutan . Currently , the road conditions appear to be deterring tourists from visiting Bhutan due to the increased instances of road blocks , landslides and dust disruption caused by the widening project .
===Rail===
Although Bhutan currently has no railways , it has entered into an agreement with India to link southern Bhutan to India 's vast network by constructing an , Indian gauge rail link between Hashimara in West Bengal and Toribari in Bhutan . The construction of the railway via Satali , Bharna Bari and Dalsingpara by Indian railways will be funded by India . Bhutan 's nearest railway station is Hasimara .
==Demographics==
Bhutan had a population of people in . Bhutan has a median age of 24.8 years . There are 1,070 males to every 1,000 females . The literacy rate in Bhutan is 59.5 percent .
=== Ethnic groups ===
Bhutanese people primarily consist of the Ngalops and Sharchop people , called the Western Bhutanese and Eastern Bhutanese respectively . Although the Sharchops are slightly larger in demographic size , the Ngalops dominate the political sphere , as the King and the political elite belong to this group . The Ngalops primarily consist of Bhutanese living in the western part of the country . Their culture is closely related to that of Tibet . Much the same could be said of the Sharchops , the largest group , who traditionally follow the Nyingmapa rather than the official Drukpa Kagyu form of Tibetan Buddhism . In modern times , with improved transportation infrastructure , there has been much intermarriage between these groups .
The Lhotshampa , meaning `` southerner Bhutanese '' , are a heterogeneous group of mostly People of Nepal ancestry who have sought political and cultural recognition including equality in right to abode , language , and dress . Unofficial estimates claimed that they constituted 45 % of the population in the 1988 census . Starting in the 1980s , Bhutan adopted a policy of `` One Nation One People '' to exert cultural ( in language , dress and religion ) and political dominance of the majority Drukpa people . The policy manifested in banning of teaching of Nepali language language in schools and denial of citizenship to those who were not able to prove officially issued land holding title prior to 1950 specifically targeting ethnic Nepali-speaking minority groups ( `` Lhotshampa '' ) , representing one-third of the population at the time . This resulted in widespread unrest and political demonstrations . In 1988 , the Bhutanese authorities carried out a special census in southern Bhutan , region of high Lhotshampa population , resulting in mass denationalization of Lhotshampas , followed by forcible deportation of 107,000 Lhotshampas , approximately one-sixth of the total population at the time . Those who had been granted citizenship by the Bhutanese Citizenship Act 1958 were stripped of their citizenship . Members of Bhutanese police and army were involved in burning of Lhotshampa houses , land confiscation and other widespread human rights abuses including arrest , torture and rape of Lhotshampas involved in political protests . Following forcible deportation from Bhutan , Lhotshampas spent almost two decades in refugee camps in Nepal and were resettled in various western countries such as the United States between 20072012 .
===Cities and towns===

* Trashigang , administrative headquarters of Trashigang District , the most populous district in the country .
* Trongsa , in central Bhutan , which has the largest and the most magnificent of all the dzongs in Bhutan .
===Religion===
It is estimated that between two-thirds and three-quarters of the Bhutanese population follow Vajrayana Buddhism , which is also the state religion . About one-quarter to one-third are followers of Hinduism . Other religions account for less than 1 % of the population . The current legal framework , in principle guarantees freedom of religion ; proselytism , however , is forbidden by a royal government decision and by judicial interpretation of the Constitution of Bhutan .
Buddhism was introduced to Bhutan in the 7th century AD . Tibetan king Songtsn Gampo ( reigned 627649 ) , a convert to Buddhism , ordered the construction of two Buddhist temples , at Bumthang ( town ) in central Bhutan and at Kyichu Lhakhang ( near Paro , Bhutan ) in the Paro Valley .
===Languages===
The national language is Dzongkha ( Bhutanese ) , one of 53 languages in the Tibetic languages family . The script , locally called Chhokey ( literally , `` Dharma language '' ) , is identical to classical Tibetan . In Bhutan 's education system , English is the medium of instruction , while Dzongkha is taught as the national language . Ethnologue lists 24 languages currently spoken in Bhutan , all of them in the Tibeto-Burman family , except Nepali language , an Indo-Aryan languages Indo-Aryan language .
Until the 1980s , the government sponsored the teaching of Nepali in schools in southern Bhutan . With the adoption of the Driglam Namzhag ( Bhutanese code of etiquette ) and its expansion into the idea of strengthening the role of Dzongkha , Nepali was dropped from the curriculum . The languages of Bhutan are still not well characterized , and several have yet to be recorded in an in-depth academic grammar . Before the 1980s , the Lhotshampa ( Nepali-speaking community ) , mainly based in southern Bhutan , constituted approximately 30 % of the population . However , after a purge of Lhotshaampas from 1990 to 1992 this number might not accurately reflect the current population .
Dzongkha is partially intelligible with Sikkimese language and spoken natively by 25 % of the population . Tshangla language , the language of the Sharchop and the principal pre-Tibetan language of Bhutan , is spoken by a greater number of people . It is not easily classified and may constitute an independent branch of Tibeto-Burman . Nepali language speakers constituted some 40 % of the population . The larger minority languages are Dzala language ( 11 % ) , Limbu language ( 10 % ) , Kheng language ( 8 % ) , and Bantawa language ( 8 % ) . There are no reliable sources for the ethnic or linguistic composition of Bhutan , so these numbers do not add up to 100 % .
=== Health ===
Bhutan has a life expectancy of 70.2 years ( 69.9 for males and 70.5 for females ) according to the latest data for 2016 from the World Bank .
Basic healthcare in Bhutan is free , as provided by the Constitution of Bhutan .
===Education===
Historically , education in Bhutan was Monasticism , with Secularity school education for the general population introduced in the 1960s . The mountainous landscape poses barriers to integrated educational services .
Today , Bhutan has two decentralized universities with eleven constituent colleges spread across the kingdom . These are the Royal University of Bhutan and Khesar Gyalpo University of Medical Sciences , respectively . The first Five-Year Plans of Bhutan five-year plan provided for a central education authorityin the form of a director of education appointed in 1961and an organized , modern school system with free and universal primary education .
Education programs were given a boost in 1990 , when the Asian Development Bank ( see Glossary ) granted a US $ 7.13 ; million loan for staff training and development , specialist services , equipment and furniture purchases , salaries and other recurrent costs , and facility rehabilitation and construction at Royal Bhutan Polytechnic .
Since the beginning of modern education in Bhutan , teachers from Indiaespecially Keralahave served in some of the most remote villages of Bhutan . Thus , 43 retired teachers who had served for the longest length of time were personally invited to Thimphu , Bhutan during the Teachers ' Day celebrations in 2018 , where they were honored and individually thanked by His Majesty Jigme Khesar Namgyel Wangchuck . To celebrate 50 years of diplomatic relations between Bhutan and India , Bhutan 's Education Minister , Jai Bir Rai honored 80 retired teachers who served in Bhutan at a special ceremony organized at Kolkata , India on 6 January 2019 . Currently , there are 121 teachers from India placed in schools across Bhutan .
==Culture==
Bhutan has a rich and unique cultural heritage that has largely remained intact because of its isolation from the rest of the world until the mid-20th century . One of the main attractions for tourists is the country 's culture and traditions . Bhutanese tradition is deeply steeped in its Buddhist heritage . Hinduism is the second most dominant religion in Bhutan , being most prevalent in the southern regions . The government is increasingly making efforts to preserve and sustain the current culture and traditions of the country . Because of its largely unspoiled natural environment and cultural heritage , Bhutan has been referred to as The Last Shangri-La .
While Bhutanese citizens are free to travel abroad , Bhutan is viewed as inaccessible by many foreigners . Another reason for it being an unpopular destination is the cost , which is high for tourists on tighter budgets . Entry is free for citizens of India , Bangladesh , and the Maldives , but all other foreigners are required to sign up with a Bhutanese tour operator and pay around US $ 250 per day that they stay in the country , though this fee covers most travel , lodging and meal expenses . Bhutan received 37,482 visitor arrivals in 2011 , of which 25 % were for meetings , incentives , conferencing , and exhibitions .
Bhutan is the List of smoking bans # Bhutan to ban smoking . It has been illegal to smoke in public or sell tobacco , according to Tobacco Control Act of Bhutan 2010 . Violators are fined the equivalent of $ 232a month 's salary in Bhutan .
===Dress===
The national dress for Bhutanese men is the gho , a knee-length robe tied at the waist by a cloth belt known as the kera . Women wear an ankle-length dress , the kira ( dress ) , which is clipped at the shoulders with two identical brooches called the koma and tied at the waist with kera . An accompaniment to the kira is a long-sleeved blouse , the `` wonju , '' which is worn underneath the kira . A long-sleeved , jacket-like garment called the `` toego '' is worn over the kira . The sleeves of the wonju and the tego are folded together at the cuffs , inside out . Social status and class determine the textures , colors , and decorations that embellish the garments .
Jewelry is commonly worn by women , especially during religious festivals ( `` tsechus '' ) and public gatherings . To strengthen Bhutan 's identity as an independent country , Bhutanese law requires all Bhutanese government employees to wear the national dress at work and all citizens to wear the national dress while visiting schools and other government offices though many citizens , particularly adults , choose to wear the customary dress as formal attire .
Varicolored scarves , known as rachu for women and kabney for men , are important indicators of social standing , as Bhutan has traditionally been a feudal society ; in particular , red is the most common color worn by women . The `` Bura Maap '' ( Red Scarf ) is one of highest honors a Bhutanese civilian can receive . It , as well as the title of Dasho , comes from the throne in recognition of an individual  s outstanding service to the nation . On previous occasions , the King himself conferred Bura Maaps to outstanding individuals such as the Director General of Department Hydropower and Power System , Yeshi Wangdi , the Deputy Chairperson of National Council , Dasho Dr. Sonam Kinga , and former National Assembly Speaker , Dasho Ugyen Dorji .
===Architecture===
Bhutanese architecture remains distinctively traditional , employing rammed earth and wattle and daub construction methods , stone masonry , and intricate woodwork around windows and roofs . Traditional architecture uses no nails or iron bars in construction . Characteristic of the region is a type of castle fortress known as the dzong architecture . Since ancient times , the dzongs have served as the religious and secular administrative centers for their respective districts . The University of Texas at El Paso in the United States has adopted Bhutanese architecture for its buildings on campus , as have the nearby Hilton Garden Inn and other buildings in the city of El Paso .
===Public holidays===
Bhutan has public holidays in Bhutan , most of which coincide with traditional , seasonal , secular or religious festivals . They include the winter solstice ( around 1 January , depending on the lunar calendar ) , Lunar New Year ( February or March ) , the King 's birthday and the anniversary of his coronation , the official end of monsoon season ( 22 September ) , National Day ( 17 December ) , and various Buddhist and Hindu celebrations .
===Film industry===
===Music and dance===
Dance dramas and masked dances such as the Cham dance are common traditional features at festivals , usually accompanied by traditional music . At these events , dancers depict heroes , demons , Daemon ( classical mythology ) , death heads , animals , gods , and caricatures of common people by wearing colorful wooden or composition face masks and stylized costumes . The dancers enjoy royal patronage , and preserve ancient folk and religious customs and perpetuate the ancient lore and art of mask-making .
The music of Bhutan can generally be divided into traditional and modern varieties ; traditional music comprises religious and folk genres , the latter including zhungdra and boedra . The modern rigsar is played on a mix of traditional instruments and electronic keyboards , and dates back to the early 1990s ; it shows the influence of Indian popular music , a hybrid form of traditional and Western popular influences .
===Family structure===
In Bhutanese families , inheritance generally passes matrilineally through the female rather than the male line . Daughters will inherit their parents ' house . A man is expected to make his own way in the world and often moves to his wife 's home . Love marriages are more common in urban areas , but the tradition of arranged marriages among acquainted families is still prevalent in most of the rural areas . Although uncommon , polygamy is accepted , often being a device to keep property in a contained family unit rather than dispersing it . The previous king , Jigme Singye Wangchuck , who abdicated in 2006 , had four queens , all of whom are sisters . The current king , Jigme Khesar Namgyel Wangchuck , wed Jetsun Pema ( born 1990 ) , 21 , a commoner and daughter of a pilot , on 13 October 2011.
===Cuisine===
Rice ( Bhutanese red rice ) , buckwheat , and increasingly maize , are the staples of Bhutanese cuisine . The local diet also includes pork , beef , yak meat , chicken , and lamb . Soups and stews of meat and dried vegetables spiced with chilies and cheese are prepared . Ema datshi , made very spicy with cheese and chilies , might be called the national dish for its ubiquity and the pride that Bhutanese have for it . Dairy foods , particularly butter and cheese from yaks and cows , are also popular , and indeed almost all milk is turned into butter and cheese . Popular beverages include butter tea , black tea , locally brewed ara ( drink ) ( rice wine ) , and beer . Bhutan is the first country in the world to have banned the sale of tobacco under its Tobacco Control Act of Bhutan 2010.
===Sports===
Bhutan 's national and most popular sport is archery . Competitions are held regularly in most villages . It differs from Olympic Games standards in technical details such as the placement of the targets and atmosphere . Two targets are placed over apart , and teams shoot from one end of the field to the other . Each member of the team shoots two arrows per round . Traditional Bhutanese archery is a social event , and competitions are organized between villages , towns , and amateur teams . There is usually plenty of food and drink complete with singing and dancing . Attempts to distract an opponent include standing around the target and making fun of the shooter 's ability . Darts ( khuru ) is an equally popular outdoor team sport , in which heavy wooden darts pointed with a 10 ; cm nail are thrown at a paperback-sized target away .
Another traditional sport is the Digor ( sports ) , which resembles the shot put and Horseshoes .
Another popular sport is basketball . In 2002 , Bhutan 's Bhutan national football team played Montserrat national football team , in what was billed as The Other Final ; the match took place on the same day Brazil played Germany in the 2002 FIFA World Cup Final , but at the time Bhutan and Montserrat were the world 's two lowest ranked teams . The match was held in Thimphu 's Changlimithang Stadium , and Bhutan won 40 . A documentary of the match was made by the Dutch filmmaker Johan Kramer . Bhutan won its first two FIFA World Cup Qualifying matches , beating Sri Lanka national football team 10 in Sri Lanka and 21 in Bhutan , taking the aggregate at 31 . Cricket has also gained popularity in Bhutan , particularly since the introduction of television channels from India . The Bhutan national cricket team is one of the most successful affiliate nations in the region .
=== Women in the workforce ===
Women have begun to participate more in the work force and their participation is one of the highest in the region . However , the unemployment rates among women are still higher than those of men and women are in more unsecure work fields , such as agriculture . Most of the work that women do outside of the home is in family-based agriculture which is insecure and is one of the reasons why women are falling behind men when it comes to income . Women also , in general , work lower-quality jobs than men and only earn 75 % of men 's earnings . The unemployment rate among women is also higher than that of men .
=== Women in the household ===
Rooted deep in Bhutan culture is the idea of selflessness and the women of Bhutan take on this role in the context of the household . Bhutan culture has shown a tolerance for domestic violence with nearly 1/4 of all women having had experienced some form of violence from their husband or partner . Some Bhutanese communities have what is referred to as matrilineal communities , where the eldest daughter receives the largest share of the land . This is due to the belief that she will stay and take care of her parents while the son will move out and work to get his own land and for his own family . Importantly , land ownership does not necessarily equate to economic benefits - despite the eldest daughter having control of the house , it is the husband that is in charge of making decisions . However , the younger generation has stepped away from this belief , in splitting the land evenly between the children instead of the eldest daughter inheriting the most land .
=== Women 's health ===
Throughout Bhutan , there has been an improvement in reproductive health services that has led to a drastic drop in maternal mortality rate , dropping from 1,000 in 1990 to 180 in 2010 . There has also been an increase in contraceptive use from less than 1/3 in 2003 to 2/3 in 2010.

Tajikistan ( , ;  , ,  Tadzhikistan ) , officially the Republic of Tajikistan (   Jumhurii Tojikiston ) , is a landlocked country in Central Asia with an area of and an estimated population of 9,537,645 people . It is bordered by Afghanistan to the AfghanistanTajikistan border , Uzbekistan to the TajikistanUzbekistan border , Kyrgyzstan to the KyrgyzstanTajikistan border and China to the ChinaTajikistan border . The traditional homelands of the Tajiks include present-day Tajikistan as well as parts of Afghanistan and Uzbekistan .
The territory that now constitutes Tajikistan was previously home to several ancient cultures , including the city of Sarazm of the Neolithic and the Bronze Age and was later home to kingdoms ruled by people of different faiths and cultures , including the Oxus Valley Civilisation , Andronovo Culture , Buddhism , Nestorian Christianity , Historical Vedic religion , Zoroastrianism , Manichaeism and Islam . The area has been ruled by numerous empires and dynasties , including the Achaemenid Empire , Sasanian Empire , Hephthalite Empire , Samanid Empire and the Mongol Empire . After being ruled by the Timurid dynasty and the Khanate of Bukhara , the Timurid Renaissance flourished . The region was later conquered by the Russian Empire and subsequently by the Soviet Union . Within the Soviet Union , the National delimitation in the Soviet Union # National delimitation in Central Asia country 's modern borders were drawn when it was part of Uzbek Soviet Socialist Republic as an Tajik Autonomous Soviet Socialist Republic before becoming a Tajik Soviet Socialist Republic full-fledged Soviet republic in 1929.
On 9 September 1991 , Tajikistan became an independent sovereign nation when the Soviet Union Dissolution of the Soviet Union . A Civil war in Tajikistan was fought almost immediately after independence , lasting from 1992 to 1997 . Since the end of the war , newly established political stability and foreign aid have allowed the country 's economy to grow . The country , led by President of Tajikistan Emomali Rahmon since 1994 , has been criticised by a number of non-governmental organizations for authoritarian leadership , corruption and widespread Human rights in Tajikistan , including torture , arbitrary imprisonment , lack of Freedom of religion in Tajikistan and other civil liberties , and worsening political repression .
Tajikistan is a presidential republic consisting of four provinces . Most of Tajikistan 's population belongs to the Tajiks ethnic group , who speak Tajik language ( a dialect of Persian language ) . Russian language is used as the inter-ethnic language . While the state is constitutionally secular , Islam in Tajikistan is practiced by 98 % of the population . In the Gorno-Badakhshan oblast , despite its sparse population , there is large linguistic diversity where Rushani dialect , Shughni language , Ishkashimi language , Wakhi language and Tajik are some of the languages spoken . Mountains cover more than 90 % of the country . It is a developing country with a transition economy that is highly dependent on remittances , aluminium and cotton production . Tajikistan is a member of the United Nations , Commonwealth of Independent States , Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe , Organisation of Islamic Cooperation , Economic Cooperation Organization , Shanghai Cooperation Organisation and Collective Security Treaty Organization as well as an NATO Partnership for Peace .
== Etymology ==
Tajikistan means the `` Land of the Tajiks '' . The suffix `` -stan '' is Persian language for `` place of '' or `` country '' and Tajik is , most likely , the name of a pre-Islamic ( before the seventh century A.D. ) tribe .
One of the most prominent Persian dictionaries , the Amid dictionary , gives the following explanations of the term , according to multiple sources :
* Neither Arab nor Turk , he who speaks Persian , a Persian-speaking person .
* An Arab child who is bred in Persia , and thus speaks Persian .
An older dictionary , : fa :  Qias Al-luqat , also defines Tajik as `` one who is neither a Mongol nor a Turk '' .
Tajikistan appeared as Tadjikistan or Tadzhikistan in English prior to 1991 . This is due to a transliteration from the ``  '' . In Russian , there is no single letter j to represent the phoneme // , and therefore  , or dzh , is used . Tadzhikistan is the most common alternate spelling and is widely used in English literature derived from Russian sources . `` Tadjikistan '' is the spelling in French and can occasionally be found in English language texts . The way of writing Tajikistan in the Perso-Arabic script is : .
Even though the Library of Congress 's 1997 Country Study of Tajikistan found it difficult to definitively state the origins of the word `` Tajik '' because the term is `` embroiled in twentieth-century political disputes about whether Turkic or Iranian peoples were the original inhabitants of Central Asia . '' most scholars concluded that contemporary Tajiks are the descendants of ancient Eastern Iranian inhabitants of Central Asia , in particular , the Sogdians and the Bactrians , and possibly other groups , with an admixture of Western Iranian Persians and non-Iranian peoples . According to Richard Nelson Frye , a leading historian of Iranian and Central Asian history , the Persian migration to Central Asia may be considered the beginning of the modern Tajik nation , and ethnic Persians , along with some elements of East-Iranian Bactrians and Sogdians , as the main ancestors of modern Tajiks . In later works , Frye expands on the complexity of the historical origins of the Tajiks . In a 1996 publication , Frye explains that many `` factors must be taken into account in explaining the evolution of the peoples whose remnants are the Tajiks in Central Asia '' and that `` the peoples of Central Asia , whether Iranian languages or Turkic languages speaking , have one culture , one religion , one set of social values and traditions with only language separating them . ''
Regarding Tajiks , the Encyclopdia Britannica states :
== History ==
=== Early history ===
Cultures in the region have been dated back to at least the 4th millennium BCE , including the Bronze Age BactriaMargiana Archaeological Complex , the Andronovo culture cultures and the Sarazm pro-urban site of Sarazm , a UNESCO World Heritage site .
The earliest recorded history of the region dates back to about 500BC when much , if not all , of modern Tajikistan was part of the Achaemenid Empire . Some authors have also suggested that in the 7th and 6th century BC , parts of modern Tajikistan , including territories in the Zeravshan valley , formed part of Kambojas before it became part of the Achaemenid Empire .
After the region 's conquest by Alexander the Great it became part of the Greco-Bactrian Kingdom , a successor state of Alexander 's empire . Northern Tajikistan ( the cities of Khujand and Panjakent ) was part of Sogdia , a collection of city-states which was overrun by Scythians and Yuezhi nomadic tribes around 150BC . The Silk Road passed through the region and following the expedition of Chinese explorer Zhang Qian during the reign of Emperor Wu of Han ( 141BC87BC ) commercial relations between Han Dynasty and Sogdiana flourished . Sogdians played a major role in facilitating trade and also worked in other capacities , as farmers , carpetweavers , glassmakers , and woodcarvers .
The Kushan Empire , a collection of Yuezhi tribes , took control of the region in the first century CE and ruled until the 4th century CE during which time Buddhism , Nestorian Christianity , Zoroastrianism , and Manichaeism were all practised in the region . Later the Hephthalite Empire , a collection of nomadic tribes , moved into the region and Arabs brought Islam in the early eighth century . Central Asia continued in its role as a commercial crossroads , linking China , the steppes to the north , and the Islamic heartland .
It was temporarily under the control of the Tibetan empire and Chinese from 650 to 680 and then under the control of the Umayyads in 710 . The Samanids , 819 to 999 , restored Persian people control of the region and enlarged the cities of Samarkand and Bukhara ( both cities are today part of Uzbekistan ) which became the cultural centres of Iran and the region was known as Khorasan . The Kara-Khanid Khanate conquered Transoxania ( which corresponds approximately with modern-day Uzbekistan , Tajikistan , southern Kyrgyzstan and southwest Kazakhstan ) and ruled between 999 and 1211 . Their arrival in Transoxania signalled a definitive shift from Iranian to Turkic predominance in Central Asia , but gradually the Kara-khanids became assimilated into the Perso-Arab Muslim culture of the region .
During Genghis Khan 's Mongol invasion of Khwarezmia and Eastern Iran in the early 13th century the Mongol Empire took control over nearly all of Central Asia . In less than a century the Mongol Empire broke up and modern Tajikistan came under the rule of the Chagatai Khanate . Tamerlane created the Timurid dynasty and took control of the region in the 14th century .
Modern Tajikistan fell under the rule of the Khanate of Bukhara during the 16th century and with the empire 's collapse in the 18th century it came under the rule of both the Emirate of Bukhara and Khanate of Kokand . The Emirate of Bukhara remained intact until the 20th century but during the 19th century , for the second time in world history , a European power ( the Russian Empire ) began to conquer parts of the region .
=== Russian Tajikistan ===
Russian Imperialism led to the Russian Empire 's conquest of Central Asia during the late 19th century 's Great Game . Between 1864 and 1885 , Russia gradually took control of the entire territory of Russian Turkestan , the Tajikistan portion of which had been controlled by the Emirate of Bukhara and Khanate of Kokand . Russia was interested in gaining access to a supply of cotton and in the 1870s attempted to switch cultivation in the region from grain to cotton ( a strategy later copied and expanded by the Soviets ) . By 1885 Tajikistan 's territory was either ruled by the Russian Empire or its vassal state , the Emirate of Bukhara , nevertheless Tajiks felt little Russian influence .
During the late 19th century the Jadid established themselves as an Islamic social movement throughout the region . Although the Jadidists were pro-modernization and not necessarily anti-Russian , the Russians viewed the movement as a threat because the Russian Empire was predominately Christian . Russian troops were required to restore order during uprisings against the Khanate of Kokand between 1910 and 1913 . Further violence occurred in July 1916 when demonstrators attacked Russian soldiers in Khujand over the threat of forced conscription during World War I . Despite Russian troops quickly bringing Khujand back under control , clashes continued throughout the year in various locations in Tajikistan .
=== Soviet Tajikistan ===
After the Russian Revolution of 1917 guerrillas throughout Central Asia , known as basmachi , waged Kokand Autonomy against Bolshevik armies in a futile attempt to maintain independence . The Bolsheviks prevailed after a four-year war , in which mosques and villages were burned down and the population heavily suppressed . Soviet authorities started a campaign of secularisation . Practising Islam , Judaism , and Christianity was discouraged and repressed , and many mosques , church ( building ) , and synagogues were closed . As a consequence of the conflict and Soviet agriculture policies , Central Asia , Tajikistan included , suffered a famine that claimed many lives .
In 1924 , the Tajik Autonomous Soviet Socialist Republic was created as a part of Uzbekistan , but in 1929 the Tajik Soviet Socialist Republic ( Tajik SSR ) was made a separate constituent republic ; however , the predominantly ethnic Tajik cities of Samarkand and Bukhara remained in the Uzbek Soviet Socialist Republic . Between 1927 and 1934 , collectivisation of agriculture and a rapid expansion of cotton production took place , especially in the southern region . Soviet collectivisation policy brought violence against peasants and forced resettlement occurred throughout Tajikistan . Consequently , some peasants fought collectivisation and revived the Basmachi movement . Some small scale industrial development also occurred during this time along with the expansion of irrigation infrastructure .
Two rounds of Stalin 's purges ( 19271934 and Great Purge 19371938 ) resulted in the expulsion of nearly 10,000 people , from all levels of the Communist Party of Tajikistan . Ethnic Russians were sent in to replace those expelled and subsequently Russians dominated party positions at all levels , including the top position of first secretary . Between 1926 and 1959 the proportion of Russians among Tajikistan 's population grew from less than 1 % to 13 % . Bobojon Ghafurov , First Secretary of the Communist Party of Tajikistan from 19461956 , was the only Tajik politician of significance outside of the country during the Soviet Era . He was followed in office by Tursun Uljabayev ( 195661 ) , Jabbor Rasulov ( 19611982 ) , and Rahmon Nabiyev ( 19821985 , 19911992 ) .
Tajiks began to be conscripted into the Soviet Army in 1939 and during World War II around 260,000 Tajik citizens fought against Germany , Finland and Japan . Between 60,000 ( 4 % ) and 120,000 ( 8 % ) of Tajikistan 's 1,530,000 citizens were killed during World War II . Following the war and Stalin 's reign , attempts were made to further expand the agriculture and industry of Tajikistan . During 195758 Nikita Khrushchev 's Virgin Lands Campaign focused attention on Tajikistan , where living conditions , education and industry lagged behind the other Republics of the Soviet Union . In the 1980s , Tajikistan had the lowest household saving rate in the USSR , the lowest percentage of households in the two top per capita income groups , and the lowest rate of university graduates per 1000 people . By the late 1980s Tajik nationalists were calling for increased rights . Real disturbances did not occur within the republic until 1990 . The following year , the Soviet Union collapsed , and Tajikistan declared its independence on 9 September 1991 , a day which is now celebrated as the country 's Independence Day ( Tajikistan ) .
=== Gaining independence ===
In Soviet times , supporters of Tajikistan independence were harshly persecuted by the KGB , and most were shot and jailed for long years . After the beginning of the Perestroika era , declared by Mikhail Gorbachev throughout the USSR , supporters of the independence of the republics began to speak openly and freely . In Tajikistan SSR , the independence movement has been active since 1987 . Supporters of independence were the Islamic Renaissance Party of Tajikistan , the Democratic Party ( Tajikistan ) and the national democratic Rastokhez Rastokhez ( Revival ) Movement . On the eve of the Dissolution of the Soviet Union , the population of Tajikistan SSR was divided into two camps . The first wanted independence for Tajikistan , the restoration of Tajik culture and language , the restoration of political and cultural relations with Iran and Afghanistan and other countries , and the second part of the population opposed independence , considering it the best option to remain part of the USSR . Opposed independence mainly Russian-speaking population of Tajikistan .
Since February 1990 , there have been riots and strikes in Dushanbe ( 1990 Dushanbe riots ) and other cities of Tajikistan due to the difficult socio-economic situation , lack of housing , and youth unemployment . The nationalist and democratic opposition , and supporters of independence joined the strikes and began to demand the independence of the republic and democratic reforms . Islamism also began to hold strikes and demand respect for their rights and independence of the republic . The Soviet leadership introduced Internal Troops in Dushanbe to eliminate the unrest .
=== Independence ===
The nation almost immediately fell into Tajikistani Civil War that involved various factions fighting one another ; these factions were often distinguished by clan loyalties . More than 500,000 residents fled during this time because of persecution , increased poverty and better economic opportunities in the West or in other former Soviet republics . Emomali Rahmon came to power in 1992 , defeating former prime minister Abdumalik Abdullajanov in a November presidential election with 58 % of the vote . The elections took place shortly after the end of the war , and Tajikistan was in a state of complete devastation . The estimated dead numbered over 100,000 . Around 1.2 million people were refugees inside and outside of the country . In 1997 , a ceasefire was reached between Rahmon and opposition parties under the guidance of Gerd D. Merrem , Special Representative to the Secretary General , a result widely praised as a successful United Nations peacekeeping initiative . The ceasefire guaranteed 30 % of ministerial positions would go to the United Tajik Opposition . Tajikistani presidential election , 1999 were held in 1999 , though they were criticised by opposition parties and foreign observers as unfair and Rahmon was re-elected with 98 % of the vote . Tajik presidential election , 2006 were again won by Rahmon ( with 79 % of the vote ) and he began his third term in office . Several opposition parties boycotted the 2006 election and the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe ( OSCE ) criticised it , although observers from the Commonwealth of Independent States claimed the elections were legal and transparent . Rahmon 's administration came under further criticism from the OSCE in October 2010 for its censorship and repression of the media . The OSCE claimed that the Tajik Government censored Tajik and foreign websites and instituted tax inspections on independent printing houses that led to the cessation of printing activities for a number of independent newspapers .
Russian border troops were stationed along the TajikAfghan border until summer 2005 . Since the September 11 , 2001 attacks , France troops have been stationed at the Dushanbe Airport in support of air operations of NATO 's International Security Assistance Force in Afghanistan . United States Army and United States Marine Corps personnel periodically visit Tajikistan to conduct joint training missions of up to several weeks duration . The Government of India rebuilt the Ayni Air Base , a military airport located 15 ; km southwest of Dushanbe , at a cost of $ 70 million , completing the repairs in September 2010 . It is now the main base of the Tajikistan air force . There have been talks with Russia concerning use of the Ayni facility , and Russia continues to maintain a large base on the outskirts of Dushanbe .
In 2010 , there were concerns among Tajik officials that Islamic militarism in the east of the country was on the rise following the escape of 25 militants from a Tajik prison in August , an ambush that killed 28 Tajik soldiers in the Rasht Valley in September , and another ambush in the valley in October that killed 30 soldiers , followed by fighting outside Gharm that left 3 militants dead . To date the country 's Interior Ministry asserts that the central government maintains full control over the country 's east , and the military operation in the Rasht Valley was concluded in November 2010 . However , 2012 Gorno-Badakhshan clashes in July 2012.
In 2015 , Russia sent more troops to Tajikistan .
In May 2015 , Tajikistan 's national security suffered a serious setback when Colonel Gulmurod Khalimov , commander of the special-purpose police unit ( OMON ) of the Interior Ministry , defected to the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant .
== Politics ==
Almost immediately after independence , Tajikistan was plunged into a civil war that saw various factions fighting one another . These factions were supported by foreign countries including Afghanistan , Iran , Pakistan , Uzbekistan and Russia . Russia and Iran focused on keeping peace in the warring nation to decrease the chances of United States U.S. or Turkey involvement . Most notably , Russia backed the pro-government faction and deployed troops from the Commonwealth of Independent States to guard the Tajikistan-Afghan border . All but 25,000 of the more than 400,000 ethnic Russians , who were mostly employed in industry , fled to Russia . By 1997 , the war had ended after a Tajikistani Civil War between the government and the Islamist-led opposition , a central government began to take form , with peaceful elections in 1999.
`` Longtime observers of Tajikistan often characterize the country as profoundly averse to risk and skeptical of promises of reform , a political passivity they trace to the country  s ruinous civil war , '' Ilan Greenberg wrote in a news article in The New York Times just before the country 's November 2006 presidential election .
Tajikistan is officially a republic , and holds Elections in Tajikistan for the List of Presidents of Tajikistan and parliament , operating under a presidential system . It is , however , a dominant-party system , where the People 's Democratic Party of Tajikistan routinely has a vast majority in Parliament . Emomali Rahmon has held the office of President of Tajikistan continuously since November 1994 . The Prime Minister is Kokhir Rasulzoda , the First Deputy Prime Minister is Matlubkhon Davlatov and the two Deputy Prime Ministers are Murodali Alimardon and Ruqiya Qurbanova .
The parliamentary elections of 2005 aroused many accusations from opposition parties and international observers that President Emomali Rahmon corruptly manipulates the election process and unemployment . The most recent elections , in February 2010 , saw the ruling PDPT lose four seats in Parliament , yet still maintain a comfortable majority . The Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe election observers said the 2010 polling `` failed to meet many key OSCE commitments '' and that `` these elections failed on many basic democratic standards . '' The government insisted that only minor violations had occurred , which would not affect the will of the Tajik people .
The presidential election held on 6 November 2006 was boycotted by `` mainline '' opposition parties , including the 23,000-member Islamic Renaissance Party of Tajikistan . Four remaining opponents `` all but endorsed the incumbent '' , Rahmon . Tajikistan gave Iran its support in Iran 's membership bid to join the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation , after a meeting between the Tajik President and the Iranian foreign minister .
Freedom of the press is ostensibly officially guaranteed by the government , but independent press outlets remain restricted , as does a substantial amount of web content . According to the Institute for War & Peace Reporting , access is blocked to local and foreign websites including avesta.tj , Tjknews.com , ferghana.ru , centrasia.org and journalists are often obstructed from reporting on controversial events . In practice , no public criticism of the regime is tolerated and all direct protest is severely suppressed and does not receive coverage in the local media .
In the Economist 's democracy index report of 2020 , Tajikistan is placed 160th , just after Saudi Arabia , as an `` authoritarian regime '' .
In July 2019 , UN ambassadors of 37 countries , including Tajikistan , have signed a joint letter to the UNHRC defending China 's Xinjiang re-education camps in the Xinjiang region .
== Geography ==
Tajikistan is landlocked country , and is the smallest nation in Central Asia by area . It lies mostly between latitudes 36th parallel north 36 and 41st parallel north 41 N , and longitudes 67th meridian east 67 and 75th meridian east 75 E. It is covered by mountains of the Pamir Mountains range , and most of the country is over above sea level . The only major areas of lower land are in the north ( part of the Fergana Valley ) , and in the southern Kofarnihon River and Vakhsh River river valleys , which form the Amu Darya . Dushanbe is located on the southern slopes above the Kofarnihon valley .
The Amu Darya and Panj River rivers mark the border with Afghanistan , and the glaciers in Tajikistan 's mountains are the major source of runoff ( water ) for the Aral Sea . There are over 900 rivers in Tajikistan longer than 10 kilometres .
=== Administrative divisions ===
Tajikistan consists of 4 administrative divisions . These are the provinces ( viloyat ) of Sughd and Khatlon , the autonomous province of Gorno-Badakhshan Autonomous Province Gorno-Badakhshan ( abbreviated as GBAO ) , and the Region of Republican Subordination ( RRP ;  Raiony Respublikanskogo Podchineniya in Romanization of Russian from Russian or NTJ     in Tajik language ; formerly known as Karotegin Province ) . Each region is divided into several Districts of Tajikistan (  , nohiya or raion ) , which in turn are subdivided into Jamoats of Tajikistan ( village-level self-governing units ) and then villages ( Qyshloqs of Tajikistan ) . , there were 58 districts and 367 jamoats in Tajikistan .
=== Lakes ===
About 2 % of the country 's area is covered by lakes , the best known of which are the following :
* Kayrakkum Reservoir Kayrakum ( Qairoqqum ) Reservoir ( Sughd )
* Iskanderkul ( Fann Mountains )
* Kulikalon Lakes ( Kul-i Kalon ) ( Fann Mountains )
* Nurek Dam ( Khatlon )
* Karakul ( Tajikistan ) ( Kyrgyz language : - ; eastern Pamir Mountains )
* Sarez Lake ( Pamir Mountains )
* Shadau Lake ( Pamir Mountains )
* Zorkul ( Pamir Mountains )
===Biodiversity===
Tajikistan contains five terrestrial ecoregions : Alai-Western Tian Shan steppe , Gissaro-Alai open woodlands , Pamir alpine desert and tundra , Badghyz and Karabil semi-desert , and Paropamisus xeric woodlands .
== Economy ==
Nearly 47 % of Tajikistan 's GDP comes from immigrant remittances ( mostly from Tajiks working in Russia ) . The current economic situation remains fragile , largely owing to corruption , uneven economic reforms , and economic mismanagement . With foreign revenue precariously dependent upon remittances from migrant workers overseas and exports of aluminium and cotton , the economy is highly vulnerable to external shocks . In FY 2000 , international assistance remained an essential source of support for rehabilitation programs that reintegrated former civil war combatants into the civilian economy , which helped keep the peace . International assistance also was necessary to address the second year of severe drought that resulted in a continued shortfall of food production . On 21 August 2001 , the Red Cross announced that a famine was striking Tajikistan , and called for international aid for Tajikistan and Uzbekistan ; however , access to food remains a problem today . In January 2012 , 680,152 of the people living in Tajikistan were living with food insecurity . Out of those , 676,852 were at risk of Phase 3 ( Acute Food and Livelihoods Crisis ) food insecurity and 3,300 were at risk of Phase 4 ( Humanitarian Emergency ) . Those with the highest risk of food insecurity were living in the remote Murghob District of Gorno-Badakhshan Autonomous Province .
Tajikistan 's economy grew substantially after the war . The GDP of Tajikistan expanded at an average rate of 9.6 % over the period of 20002007 according to the World Bank data . This improved Tajikistan 's position among other Central Asian countries ( namely Turkmenistan and Uzbekistan ) , which seem to have degraded economically ever since . The primary sources of income in Tajikistan are aluminium production , cotton growing and remittances from migrant workers . Cotton accounts for 60 % of agricultural output , supporting 75 % of the rural population , and using 45 % of irrigated arable land . The aluminium industry is represented by the state-owned Tajik Aluminum Company  the biggest aluminium plant in Central Asia and one of the biggest in the world .
Tajikistan 's rivers , such as the Vakhsh River and the Panj River , have great hydropower potential , and the government has focused on attracting investment for projects for internal use and electricity exports . Tajikistan is home to the Nurek Dam , the second highest dam in the world . Lately , Russia 's RAO UES energy giant has been working on the Sangtuda-1 hydroelectric power station ( 670 ; MW capacity ) commenced operations on 18 January 2008 . Other projects at the development stage include Sangtuda-2 by Iran , Zerafshan by the Chinese company SinoHydro , and the Rogun Dam that , at a projected height of , would supersede the Nurek Dam as highest in the world if it is brought to completion . A planned project , CASA-1000 , will transmit 1000 MW of surplus electricity from Tajikistan to Pakistan with power transit through Afghanistan . The total length of transmission line is 750 ; km while the project is planned to be on Public-Private Partnership basis with the support of WB , IFC , ADB and IDB . The project cost is estimated to be around US $ 865 million . Other energy resources include sizeable coal deposits and smaller , relatively unexplored reserves of natural gas and petroleum .
In 2014 Tajikistan was the world 's most remittance-dependent economy with remittances accounting for 49 % of GDP and expected to fall by 40 % in 2015 due to the economic crisis in the Russian Federation . Tajik migrant workers abroad , mainly in the Russian Federation , have become by far the main source of income for millions of Tajikistan 's people and with the 20142015 downturn in the Russian economy the World Bank has predicted large numbers of young Tajik men will return home and face few economic prospects .
According to some estimates about 20 % of the population lives on less than US $ 1.25 per day . Migration from Tajikistan and the consequent remittances have been unprecedented in their magnitude and economic impact . In 2010 , remittances from Tajik labour migrants totalled an estimated $ 2.1 billion US dollars , an increase from 2009 . Tajikistan has achieved transition from a planned to a market economy without substantial and protracted recourse to aid ( of which it by now receives only negligible amounts ) , and by purely market-based means , simply by exporting its main commodity of comparative advantage ;  cheap labour . The World Bank Tajikistan Policy Note 2006 concludes that remittances have played an important role as one of the drivers of Tajikistan 's economic growth during the past several years , have increased incomes , and as a result helped significantly reduce poverty .
Drug trafficking is the major illegal source of income in Tajikistan as it is an important transit country for Afghan narcotics bound for Russian and , to a lesser extent , Western European markets ; some opium poppy is also raised locally for the domestic market . However , with the increasing assistance from international organisations , such as UNODC , and co-operation with the US , Russian , EU and Afghan authorities a level of progress on the fight against illegal drug-trafficking is being achieved . Tajikistan holds third place in the world for [ and raw opium ] confiscations ( 1216.3 ; kg of heroin and 267.8 ; kg of raw opium in the first half of 2006 ) . Drug money corrupts the country 's government ; according to some experts the well-known personalities that fought on both sides of the [ [ Civil war in Tajikistan and have held the positions in the government after the armistice was signed are now involved in the drug trade . UNODC is working with Tajikistan to strengthen border crossings , provide training , and set up joint interdiction teams . It also helped to establish Tajikistani Drug Control Agency . Tajikistan is also an active member of the Economic Cooperation Organization ( ECO ) .
Besides Russia , China is one of the major economic and trade partners of Dushanbe . Tajikistan belongs to the group of countries with a high debt trap risk associated with Chinese investment within the Belt and Road Initiative ( BRI ) meaning that excessive reliance on Chinese loans may weaken country 's ability to manage its external debt in a sustainable way .
== Transportation ==
In 2013 Tajikistan , like many of the other Central Asian countries , was experiencing major development in its transportation sector .
As a landlocked country Tajikistan has no ports and the majority of transportation is via roads , air , and rail . In recent years Tajikistan has pursued agreements with Iran and Pakistan to gain port access in those countries via Afghanistan . In 2009 , an agreement was made between Tajikistan , Pakistan , and Afghanistan to improve and build a 1,300 ; km ( 810 ; mi ) highway and rail system connecting the three countries to Pakistan 's ports . The proposed route would go through the Gorno-Badakhshan Autonomous Province in the eastern part of the country . And in 2012 , the presidents of Tajikistan , Afghanistan , and Iran signed an agreement to construct roads and railways as well as oil , gas , and water pipelines to connect the three countries .
=== Rail ===
The railroad system totals only of track , all of it Russian gauge . The principal segments are in the southern region and connect the capital with the industrial areas of the Hisor and Vakhsh , Tajikistan valleys and with Uzbekistan , Turkmenistan , Kazakhstan and Russia . Most international freight traffic is carried by train . The recently constructed QurghonteppaKulob railway connected the Kulob District with the central area of the country .
=== Air ===
In 2009 Tajikistan had 26 airports , 18 of which had paved runways , of which two had runways longer than 3,000 meters . The country 's main airport is Dushanbe International Airport , which as of April 2015 had regularly-scheduled flights to major cities in Russia , Central Asia , as well as Delhi , Dubai , Frankfurt , Istanbul , Kabul , Tehran , and rmqi , amongst others . There are also international flights , mainly to Russia , from Khujand Airport in the northern part of the country as well as limited international services from Kulob Airport , and Qurghonteppa International Airport . Khorog Airport is a domestic airport and also the only airport in the sparsely populated eastern half of the country .
Tajikistan has one major airline ( Somon Air ) and is also serviced by over a dozen foreign airlines .
=== Roads ===
The total length of roads in the country is 27,800 kilometres . Automobiles account for more than 90 % of the total volume of passenger transportation and more than 80 % of domestic freight transportation .
In 2004 the TajikAfghan Friendship Bridge between Afghanistan and Tajikistan was built , improving the country 's access to South Asia . The bridge was built by the United States .
many highway and tunnel construction projects are underway or have recently been completed . Major projects include rehabilitation of the Dushanbe  Chanak ( Uzbek border ) , Dushanbe  Kulma ( Chinese border ) , and Kurgan-Tube  Nizhny Pyanj ( Afghan border ) highways , and construction of tunnels under the mountain passes of Anzob Tunnel , Shakhristan , Shar-Shar and Chormazak . These were supported by international donor countries .

Tajikistan has a population of 9,275,832 people , of which 70 % are under the age of 30 and 35 % are between the ages of 14 and 30 . Tajik people who speak Tajik language ( a dialect of Persian language ) are the main ethnic group , although there are sizeable minorities of Uzbeks and Russians , whose numbers are declining due to emigration . The Pamiri people of Badakhshan , a small population of Yaghnobi people , and a sizeable minority of Ismailis are all considered to belong to the larger group of Tajiks . All citizens of Tajikistan are called Tajikistanis .
In 1989 , ethnic Russians in Tajikistan made up 7.6 % of the population , but they are now less than 0.5 % , after the civil war spurred Russian emigration . The History of Germans in Russia and the Soviet Union population of Tajikistan has also declined due to emigration : having topped at 38,853 in 1979 , it has almost vanished since the collapse of the Soviet Union .
=== Languages ===
The state and official language of the Republic of Tajikistan is Tajik language , which is written in the Tajik alphabet . In fact , the Tajik language is a variant of the Persian language Persian language ( or Farsi ) . This fact is also recognized by linguists . Therefore , Tajik speakers have no problems communicating with Persian speakers from Iran and Dari speakers from Afghanistan . Several million native Tajik speakers also live in neighboring Uzbekistan and Russia .
Tajik became the official language of the Tajik Soviet Socialist Republic on July 22 , 1989 . Before that , since the creation of the Tajikistan SSR , the only official language of the republic was the Russian language , and the Tajik language had only the status of the  national language  . Russian lost its official status after Tajikistan 's independence in late 1991 . Despite this , according to article 2 of the Constitution of the Republic of Tajikistan , Russian language is recognized as the official language of inter-ethnic communication in the country . Approximately 90 % of the population of Tajikistan speaks Russian at various levels . The highly educated part of the population of Tajikistan , as well as the Intelligentsia , prefer to speak Russian and Persian , the pronunciation of which in Tajikistan is called the  Iranian style  .
Apart from Russian , Uzbek language is actually the second most widely spoken language in Tajikistan after Tajik . Native Uzbek speakers live in the north and west of Tajikistan . In the fourth place ( after Tajik , Russian and Uzbek ) by the number of native speakers are various Pamir languages whose native speakers live in Gorno-Badakhshan Autonomous Region . The majority of Zoroastrian in Tajikistan speak it in the Pamir languages . Native speakers of the Kyrgyz language live in the north of Gorno-Badakhshan Autonomous Region . Yagnobi language speakers live in the west of the country . The Parya language of local Romani people ( : ru :   ) is also widely spoken in Tajikistan . Tajikistan also has small communities of native speakers of Persian language , Arabic language , Pashto , Eastern Armenian , Azerbaijani language , Tatar language , Turkmen language , Kazakh language , Chinese language , Ukrainian language .
Among foreign languages , the most popular is English language , which is taught in schools in Tajikistan as one of the foreign languages . Some young people , as well as those working in the tourism sector of Tajikistan , speak English at different levels . Of the European languages , there are also a sufficient number of native speakers of German language and French language . The Uzbek population is learning Turkish language .
=== Employment ===
In 2009 nearly one million Tajiks worked abroad ( mainly in Russia ) . More than 70 % of the female population lives in traditional villages .
=== Culture ===
The Tajik language is the mother tongue of around 80 % of the citizens of Tajikistan . The main urban centres in today 's Tajikistan include Dushanbe ( the capital ) , Khujand , Kulob , Panjakent , Qurghonteppa , Khorugh and Istaravshan . There are also Uzbeks , Kyrgyz people and Russians minorities .
The Pamiri people of Gorno-Badakhshan Autonomous Province in the southeast , bordering Afghanistan and China , though considered part of the Tajik people , nevertheless are distinct linguistically and culturally from most Tajiks . In contrast to the mostly Sunni Muslim residents of the rest of Tajikistan , the Pamiris overwhelmingly follow the Ismaili branch of Shia Islam , and speak a number of Eastern Iranian languages , including Shughni language , Rushani language , Khufi language and Wakhi language . Isolated in the highest parts of the Pamir Mountains , they have preserved many ancient cultural traditions and folk arts that have been largely lost elsewhere in the country .
The Yaghnobi people live in mountainous areas of northern Tajikistan . The estimated number of Yaghnobis is now about 25,000 . Forced migrations in the 20th century decimated their numbers . They speak the Yaghnobi language , which is the only direct modern descendant of the ancient Sogdian language .
Tajikistan artisans created the Dushanbe Tea House , which was presented in 1988 as a gift to the sister city of Boulder , Colorado .
=== Religion ===
Sunni Islam of the Hanafi school has been officially recognised by the government since 2009 . Tajikistan considers itself a secular state with a Constitution providing for freedom of religion . The Government has declared two Islamic holidays , Eid ul-Fitr and Eid al-Adha , as state holidays . According to a US State Department release and Pew research group , the population of Tajikistan is 98 % Muslim . Approximately 87 % 95 % of them are Sunni Islam and roughly 3 % are Shia and roughly 7 % are non-denominational Muslims . The remaining 2 % of the population are followers of Russian Orthodox Church , Protestantism , Zoroastrianism and Buddhism . A great majority of Muslims fast during Ramadan , although only about one third in the countryside and 10 % in the cities observe daily prayer and dietary restrictions .
Bukharan Jews had lived in Tajikistan since the 2nd century BCE , but today almost none are left . In the 1940s , the Jewish community of Tajikistan numbered nearly 30,000 people . Most were Persian-speaking Bukharan Jews who had lived in the region for millennia along with Ashkenazi Jews from Eastern Europe who resettled there in the Soviet era . The Jewish population is now estimated at less than 500 , about half of whom live in Dushanbe .
Relationships between religious groups are generally amicable , although there is some concern among mainstream Muslim leaders that minority religious groups undermine national unity . There is a concern for religious institutions becoming active in the political sphere . The Islamic Renaissance Party of Tajikistan ( IRP ) , a major combatant in the Tajikistan Civil War 19921997 Civil War and then-proponent of the creation of an State religion # Islamic states in Tajikistan , constitutes no more than 30 % of the government by statute . Membership in Hizb ut-Tahrir , a militant Islamic party which today aims for an overthrow of secular governments and the unification of Tajiks under one Islamic state , is illegal and members are subject to arrest and imprisonment . Numbers of large mosques appropriate for Friday prayers are limited and some feel this is discriminatory .
By law , religious communities must register by the State Committee on Religious Affairs ( SCRA ) and with local authorities . Registration with the SCRA requires a charter , a list of 10 or more members , and evidence of local government approval prayer site location . Religious groups who do not have a physical structure are not allowed to gather publicly for prayer . Failure to register can result in large fines and closure of place of worship . There are reports that registration on the local level is sometimes difficult to obtain . People under the age of 18 are also barred from public religious practice .
As of January 2016 , as part of an `` anti-radicalisation campaign '' , police in the Khatlon region reportedly shaved the beards of 13,000 men and shut down 160 shops selling the hijab . Shaving beards and discouraging women from wearing hijab is part of a government campaign targeting trends that are deemed `` alien and inconsistent with Tajik culture '' , and `` to preserve secular traditions '' .
Today , approximately 1.6 % of the population in Tajikistan is Christianity , mostly Russian Orthodox Church .
The territory of Tajikistan is part of the : ru :   of the : ru :    of the Russian Orthodox Church . The country is also home to communities of Catholic Church , Armenian Apostolic Church , Protestantism , Lutheranism , Jehovah 's Witnesses , Baptists , Mormons , and Adventists .
== Health ==
Despite repeated efforts by the Tajik government to improve and expand health care , the system remains among the most underdeveloped and poor , with severe shortages of medical supplies . The state 's Ministry of Labor and Social Welfare reported that 104,272 disabled people are registered in Tajikistan ( 2000 ) . This group of people suffers most from poverty in Tajikistan . The government of Tajikistan and the World Bank considered activities to support this part of the population described in the World Bank 's Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper . Public expenditure on health was at 1 % of the GDP in 2004.
Life expectancy at birth was estimated to be 69 years in 2020 . The infant mortality rate was approximately 30.42 deaths per 1,000 children in 2018 . In 2014 , there were 2.1 physicians per 1,000 people , higher than any other low-income country after North Korea .
Tajikistan has experienced a sharp decrease in number of per capita hospital beds following the dissolution of the Soviet Union ( since 1992 ) , even though the number still remains relatively at 4.8 beds per 1,000 people , well above the world average of 2.7 and one of the highest among other low-income countries .
According to World Bank , 96 % of births are attended by skilled health staff , a figure which has risen from 66.6 % in 1999.
In 2010 the country experienced an outbreak of polio that caused more than 457 cases of polio in both children and adults , and resulted in 29 deaths before being brought under control .

Barbados ( or ) is an island country in the Lesser Antilles of the West Indies , in the Caribbean region of North America . It is in length and up to in width , covering an area of . It is in the western area of the North Atlantic and east of the Windward Islands and the Caribbean Sea ; therein , Barbados is the most easterly of the Caribbean Islands . Barbados is east of the Windwards , part of the Lesser Antilles , roughly at 13th parallel north 13N of the equator . It is about east of both the countries of Saint Lucia and Saint Vincent and the Grenadines and south-east of Martinique and north-east of Trinidad and Tobago . Barbados is outside the principal Atlantic [ belt ] . Its capital and largest city is Bridgetown , Barbados .
Inhabited by Island Caribs people since the 13th century , and prior to that by other Amerindians , Barbados was visited by Spanish navigators in the late 15th century and claimed for the Monarchy of Spain . It first appeared on a Spanish map in 1511 . The Portuguese Empire claimed the island between 1532 and 1536 , but later abandoned it in 1620 with their only remnants being an introduction of wild boars for a good supply of meat whenever the island was visited . An Kingdom of England ship , the Olive Blossom , arrived in Barbados on 14 May 1625 ; its men took possession of it in the name of James VI and I . In 1627 , the first permanent settlers arrived from England , and it became an English overseas possessions and later British colonisation of the Americas # British Caribbean colonies . As a wealthy sugar colony , it became an English centre of the African slave trade until that trade was outlawed by the Slave Trade Act 1807 , with final emancipation of slaves in Barbados occurring over a period of years following the Slavery Abolition Act 1833.
On 30 November 1966 , Barbados became an independent state and Commonwealth realm with Elizabeth II as Queen of Barbados , though the country is set to remove her as its head of state and become a republic by 30 November 2021 . It has a population of 287,010 people , predominantly of African descent . Despite being classified as an Atlantic island , Barbados is considered to be a part of the Caribbean , where it is ranked as a leading tourist destination . Of the tourists , 40 % come from the UK , with the US and Canada making up the next large groups of visitors to the island .
==Etymology==
The name `` Barbados '' is from either the Portuguese language term os barbudos or the Spanish language equivalent , los barbudos , both meaning `` the bearded ones '' . It is unclear whether `` bearded '' refers to the long , hanging roots of the bearded fig-tree ( Ficus citrifolia ) , indigenous to the island , or to the allegedly bearded Island Caribs who once inhabited the island , or , more fancifully , to a visual impression of a beard formed by the sea foam that sprays over the outlying reefs . In 1519 , a map produced by the Genoa mapmaker Visconte Maggiolo showed and named Barbados in its correct position . Furthermore , the island of Barbuda in the Leeward Islands is very similar in name and was once named `` Las Barbudas italic=unset '' by the Spanish .
The original name for Barbados in the Pre-Columbian era was Ichirouganaim , according to accounts by descendants of the indigenous Arawakan languages-speaking tribes in other regional areas , with possible translations including `` Red land with white teeth '' or `` Redstone island with teeth outside ( reefs ) '' or simply `` Teeth '' .
Colloquially , Barbadians refer to their home island as `` Bim '' or other nicknames associated with Barbados , including `` Bimshire '' . The origin is uncertain , but several theories exist . The National Cultural Foundation of Barbados says that `` Bim '' was a word commonly used by slaves , and that it derives from the Igbo language term bm from b m meaning 'my home , kindred , kind ' , the Igbo phoneme in the Igbo orthography is very close to . The name could have arisen due to the relatively large percentage of enslaved Igbo people from modern-day southeastern Nigeria arriving in Barbados in the 18th century . The words 'Bim ' and 'Bimshire ' are recorded in the Oxford English Dictionary and Chambers Dictionary . Another possible source for 'Bim ' is reported to be in the Agricultural Reporter of 25 April 1868 , where the Rev . N. Greenidge ( father of one of the island 's most famous scholars , Abel Hendy Jones Greenidge ) suggested the listing of Bimshire as a county of England . Expressly named were `` Wiltshire , Hampshire , Berkshire and Bimshire '' . Lastly , in the Daily Argosy ( of Demerara , i.e . Guyana ) of 1652 , there is a reference to Bim as a possible corruption of 'Byam ' , the name of a Royalist leader against the Parliamentarians . That source suggested the followers of Byam became known as 'Bims ' and that this became a word for all Barbadians .
== History ==
===Pre-colonial period===
Archeological evidence suggests humans may have first settled or visited the island circa 1600 BC . More permanent Amerindian settlement of Barbados dates to about the 4th to 7th centuries AD , by a group known as the Saladoid-Barrancoid . The two main groups were the Arawaks from South America , who became dominant around 8001200 AD , and the more war-like Kalinago ( Island Caribs ) who arrived from South America in the 12th13th centuries
===European arrival===
It is uncertain which European nation arrived first in Barbados , which probably would have been at some point in the 15th century or 16th century . One lesser-known source points to earlier revealed works predating contemporary sources indicating it could have been the Spanish . Many , if not most , believe the History of Portugal ( 1415-1542 ) , en route to Brazil , were the first Europeans to come upon the island . The island was largely ignored by Europeans , though Spanish slave raiding is thought to have reduced the native population , with many fleeing to other islands .
===English settlement in the 1600s===
The first English ship , which had arrived on 14 May 1625 , was captained by John Powell . The first settlement began on 17 February 1627 , near what is now Holetown ( formerly Jamestown ) , by a group led by John Powell 's younger brother , Henry , consisting of 80 settlers and 10 English indentured laborers . Some sources state that some Africans were amongst these first settlers .
The settlement was established as a proprietary colony and funded by Sir William Courten , a City of London merchant who acquired the title to Barbados and several other islands . So the first colonists were actually tenants and much of the profits of their labour returned to Courten and his company . Courten 's title was later transferred to James Hay , 1st Earl of Carlisle , in what was called the `` Great Barbados Robbery . '' Carlisle then chose as governor Henry Hawley ( governor ) , who established the Barbados House of Assembly in 1639 , in an effort to appease the planters , who might otherwise have opposed his controversial appointment .
In the period 164060 , the West Indies attracted over two-thirds of the total number of English emigrants to the Americas . By 1650 there were 44,000 settlers in the West Indies , as compared to 12,000 on the Chesapeake Bay and 23,000 in New England . Most English arrivals were indentured . After five years of labour , they were given `` freedom dues '' of about 10 , usually in goods . Before the mid-1630s , they also received of land , but after that time the island filled and there was no more free land . During the Interregnum ( England ) ( 1650s ) this included a large number of prisoners-of-war , vagrants and people who were illicitly kidnapped , who were forcibly transported to the island and sold as servants . These last two groups were predominantly Irish , as several thousand were infamously rounded up by English merchants and sold into servitude in Barbados and other Caribbean islands during this period , a practice that came to be known as being Barbadosed . Cultivation of tobacco , cotton , ginger and indigo was thus handled primarily by European indentured labour until the start of the sugar cane industry in the 1640s and the growing reliance on and importation of enslaved Africans .
Life in the young colony was not easy , with parish registers from the 1650s show , for the white population , there were four times as many deaths as marriages . The mainstay of the infant colony 's economy was the growth export of tobacco , but tobacco prices eventually fell in the 1630s as Chesapeake production expanded .
====Effects of the English Civil War====
Around the same time , fighting during the War of the Three Kingdoms and the Interregnum ( England ) spilled over into Barbados and Barbadian territorial waters . The island was not English Revolution in the Colonies until after the execution of Charles I of England , when the island 's government fell under the control of Royalists ( ironically the Governor , Philip Bell , remaining loyal to Parliament of England while the Barbadian House of Assembly , under the influence of Humphrey Walrond , supported Charles II of England ) . To try to bring the recalcitrant colony to heel , the Rump Parliament # Commonwealth of England passed an act on 3 October 1650 prohibiting trade between England and Barbados , and because the island also traded with the Netherlands , further navigation acts were passed prohibiting any but English vessels trading with Dutch colonies # Atlantic . These acts were a precursor to the First Anglo-Dutch War . The Commonwealth of England sent an invasion force under the command of George Ayscue , which arrived in October 1651 . Ayscue with a smaller force which included Scottish prisoners surprised a larger force of Royalists , but had to resort to spying and diplomacy ultimately . On January 11 , 1652 , the Royalists in the House of Assembly led by Francis Willoughby , 5th Baron Willoughby of Parham surrendered which marked the end of royalist privateering as a major threat . The conditions of the surrender were incorporated into the Charter of Barbados ( Treaty of Oistins ) , which was signed at the Mermaid 's Inn , Oistins , on 17 January 1652.
Lord Nelson Statue was removed from Bridgetown on November 16th , 2020.
===Irish people in Barbados===
Starting with Cromwell , a large percentage of the white labourer population were indentured servants and involuntarily transported people from Ireland . Irish servants in Barbados were often treated poorly , and Barbadian planters gained a reputation for cruelty . The decreased appeal of an indenture on Barbados , combined with enormous demand for labour caused by sugar cultivation , led the use of involuntary transportation to Barbados as a punishment for crimes , or for political prisoners , and also to the kidnapping of labourers who were sent to Barbados involuntarily . Irish indentured servants were a significant portion of the population throughout the period when white servants were used for plantation labour in Barbados , and while a `` steady stream '' of Irish servants entered the Barbados throughout the seventeenth century , Cromwellian efforts to pacify Ireland created a `` veritable tidal wave '' of Irish labourers who were sent to Barbados during the 1650s . Due to inadequate historical records , the total number of Irish labourers sent to Barbados is unknown , and estimates have been `` highly contentious . '' While one historical source estimated that as many as 50,000 Irish people were transported to either Barbados or Virginia unwillingly during the 1650s , this estimate is `` quite likely exaggerated . '' Another estimate that 12,000 Irish prisoners had arrived in Barbados by 1655 has been described as `` probably exaggerated '' by historian Richard B. Sheridan . According to historian Thomas Bartlett , it is `` generally accepted '' that approximately 10,000 Irish were sent to the West Indies involuntarily , and approximately 40,000 came as voluntary indentured servants , while many also travelled as voluntary , un-indentured emigrants .
====The sugar revolution====
The introduction of sugar cane from Dutch Brazil in 1640 completely transformed society , the economy and the physical landscape . Barbados eventually had one of the world 's biggest sugar industries . One group instrumental in ensuring the early success of the industry was the Sephardi Jews , who had originally been expelled from the Iberian peninsula , to end up in Dutch Brazil . As the effects of the new crop increased , so did the shift in the ethnic composition of Barbados and surrounding islands . The workable sugar plantation required a large investment and a great deal of heavy labour . At first , Dutch traders supplied the equipment , financing , and enslaved Africans , in addition to transporting most of the sugar to Europe . In 1644 the population of Barbados was estimated at 30,000 , of which about 800 were of African descent , with the remainder mainly of English descent . These English smallholders were eventually bought out and the island filled up with large sugar plantations worked by enslaved Africans . By 1660 there was near parity with 27,000 blacks and 26,000 whites . By 1666 at least 12,000 white smallholders had been bought out , died , or left the island , many choosing to emigrate to Jamaica or the American Colonies ( notably the Carolinas ) . As a result , Barbados enacted a Barbados Slave Code as a way of legislatively controlling its black enslaved population . The law 's text was influential in laws in other colonies .
By 1680 there were 20,000 free whites and 46,000 enslaved Africans ; by 1724 , there were 18,000 free whites and 55,000 enslaved Africans .
===18th and 19th centuries===
The harsh conditions endured by the slaves resulted in several planned slave rebellions , the largest of which was Bussa 's rebellion in 1816 which was suppressed by British troops . Growing opposition to slavery led to its abolition in the British Empire in 1833 . However the plantocracy class retained control of the political and economic situation on the island , with most workers living in relative poverty .
The Great Hurricane of 1780 killed over 4,000 people on Barbados . In 1854 , a cholera epidemic killed over 20,000 inhabitants .
===20th century  colonial period===
Deep dissatisfaction with the situation on Barbados led many to emigrate . Things came to a head in the 1930s during the Great Depression , as Barbadians began demanding better conditions for workers , the legalisation of trade unions and a widening of the franchise , which at that point was limited to male property owners . As a result of the increasing unrest the British sent a commission ( The West Indies Royal Commission , or Moyne Commission ) in 1938 , which recommended enacting many of the requested reforms on the islands . As a result , Afro-Barbadians began to play a much more prominent role in the colony 's politics , with universal suffrage being introduced in 1950.
Prominent among these early activists was Grantley Herbert Adams , who helped found the Barbados Labour Party ( BLP ) in 1938 . He became the first Premier of Barbados in 1953 , followed by fellow BLP-founder Hugh Gordon Cummins from 1958 to 1961 . A group of left-leaning politicians who advocated swifter moves to independence broke off from the BLP and founded the Democratic Labour Party ( Barbados ) ( DLP ) in 1955 . The DLP subsequently won the 1961 Barbadian general election and their leader Errol Barrow became premier .
Full internal self-government was enacted in 1961 . Barbados joined the short-lived West Indies Federation from 1958 to 1962 , later gaining full independence on 30 November 1966 . Errol Barrow became the country 's first prime minister . Barbados opted to remain within the British Commonwealth , retaining Queen Elizabeth as Monarchy of Barbados , represented locally by a Governor-General of Barbados governor-general .
===Post-independence era===
The Barrow government sought to diversify the economy away from agriculture , seeking to boost industry and the tourism sector . Barbados was also at forefront of regional integration efforts , spearheading the creation of CARIFTA and CARICOM . The DLP lost the 1976 Barbadian general election to the BLP under Tom Adams ( politician ) . Adams adopted a more conservative and strongly pro-Western stance , allowing the Americans to use Barbados as the launchpad for their United States invasion of Grenada in 1983 . Adams died in office in 1985 and was replaced by Harold Bernard St. John , however he lost the 1986 Barbadian general election which saw the return of the DLP under Errol Barrow , who had been highly critical of the US intervention in Grenada . However Barrow too died in office , and was replaced by Lloyd Erskine Sandiford who remained Prime Minister until 1994.
Owen Arthur of the BLP won the 1994 Barbadian general election , remaining Prime Minister until 2008 . Arthur was a strong advocate of republicanism , though a planned referendum to replace Queen Elizabeth as Head of State in 2008 never took place . The DLP won the 2008 Barbadian general election , however the new Prime Minister David Thompson ( Barbadian politician ) died in 2010 and was replaced by Freundel Stuart . The BLP returned to power 2018 Barbadian general election under Mia Mottley , who became Barbados 's first female Prime Minister .
Barbados announced on 15 September 2020 that it intends to become a republic by 30 November 2021 , the 55th anniversary of its independence . It plans to replace the Queen with its own elected official as head of state . At this point , Barbados will cease to be a Commonwealth realm , but will maintain membership in the Commonwealth of Nations . Critics claim that the move came about in part because China exerted pressure on Barbados .
== Geography and climate ==
Barbados is situated in the Atlantic Ocean , east of the other West Indies Islands . Barbados is the easternmost island in the Lesser Antilles . It is flat in comparison to its island neighbours to the west , the Windward Islands . The island rises gently to the central highland region known as Scotland District , with the high point of the nation being Mount Hillaby above sea level .
In the parish of Saint Michael , Barbados lies Barbados 's capital and main city , Bridgetown , containing 1/3 of the country 's population . Other major towns scattered across the island include Holetown , in the parish of Saint James , Barbados ; Oistins , in the parish of Christ Church , Barbados ; and Speightstown , in the parish of Saint Peter , Barbados .
=== Geology ===
Barbados lies on the boundary of the South American plate and the Caribbean Plates . The subduction of the South American plate beneath the Caribbean plate scrapes sediment from the South American plate and deposits it above the subduction zone forming an Accretionary wedge . The rate of this depositing of material allows Barbados to rise at a rate of about per 1,000 years . This subduction means Geology the island is composed of coral roughly thick , where reefs formed above the sediment . The land slopes in a series of `` terraces '' in the west and goes into an incline in the east . A large proportion of the island is circled by coral reefs .
The erosion of limestone in the northeast of the island , in the Scotland District , has resulted in the formation of various caves and Gully . On the Atlantic Ocean east coast of the island coastal landforms , including stacks , have been created due to the limestone composition of the area . Also notable in the island is the rocky cape known as Pico Teneriffe ( Barbados ) or Pico de Tenerife , which is named after the fact that the island of Tenerife in Spain is the first land east of Barbados according to the belief of the locals .
=== Climate ===
The country generally experiences two seasons , one of which includes noticeably higher rainfall . Known as the `` wet season '' , this period runs from June to December . By contrast , the `` dry season '' runs from December to May . Annual precipitation ranges between .
From December to May the average temperatures range from , while between June and November , they range from .
On the Kppen climate classification scale , much of Barbados is regarded as a tropical monsoon climate ( Am ) . However , breezes of abound throughout the year and give Barbados a climate which is moderately tropical .
Infrequent natural hazards include earthquakes , landslips , and [ Barbados is often spared the worst effects of the region 's tropical storm ] s and [ during the rainy season . Its location in the south-east of the Caribbean region puts the country just outside the principal [ [ hurricane strike zone ] . On average , a major hurricane strikes about once every 26 years . The last significant hit from a hurricane to cause severe damage to Barbados was [ [ Hurricane Janet in 1955 ; in 2010 the island was struck by Hurricane Tomas , but this caused only minor damage across the country as it was only at Tropical Storm level of formation .
=== Environmental issues ===
Barbados is susceptible to environmental pressures . As one of the world 's most List of island countries by population density , the government worked during the 1990s to aggressively integrate the growing south coast of the island into the Bridgetown Sewage Treatment Plant to reduce contamination of offshore coral reefs . As of the first decade of the 21st century , a second treatment plant has been proposed along the island 's west coast . Being so densely populated , Barbados has made great efforts to protect its underground aquifers .
As a coral-limestone island , Barbados is highly permeable to seepage of surface water into the earth . The government has placed great emphasis on protecting the catchment areas that lead directly into the huge network of underground aquifers and streams . On occasion illegal squatters have breached these areas , and the government has removed squatters to preserve the cleanliness of the underground springs which provide the island 's drinking water .
The government has placed a huge emphasis on keeping Barbados clean with the aim of protecting the environment and preserving offshore coral reefs which surround the island . Many initiatives to mitigate human pressures on the coastal regions of Barbados and seas come from the Coastal Zone Management Unit ( CZMU ) . Barbados has nearly of coral reefs just offshore and two protected marine parks have been established off the west coast . Overfishing is another threat which faces Barbados .
Although on the opposite side of the Atlantic , and some west of Africa , Barbados is one of many places in the American continent that experience heightened levels of mineral dust from the Sahara Desert . Some particularly intense dust episodes have been blamed partly for the impacts on the health of coral reefs surrounding Barbados or asthmatic episodes , but evidence has not wholly supported the former such claim .
Access to biocapacity in Barbados is much lower than world average . In 2016 , Barbados had 0.17 global hectares of biocapacity per person within its territory , much less than the world average of 1.6 global hectares per person . In 2016 Barbados used 0.84 global hectares of biocapacity per person - their ecological footprint of consumption . This means they use approximately five times as much biocapacity as Barbados contains . As a result , Barbados is running a biocapacity deficit .
=== Wildlife ===
Barbados is host to four species of nesting turtles ( green turtles , Loggerhead sea turtle , [ turtle ] s , and leatherbacks ) and has the second-largest hawksbill turtle-breeding population in the Caribbean . The driving of vehicles on beaches can crush nests buried in the sand and such activity is discouraged in nesting areas .
Barbados is also the host to the green monkey . The green monkey is found in West Africa from Senegal to the Volta River . It has been introduced to the Cape Verde islands off north-western Africa , and the West Indian islands of Saint Kitts , Nevis , Saint Martin , and Barbados . It was introduced to the West Indies in the late 17th century when slave trade ships travelled to the Caribbean from West Africa .
== Demographics ==
The 2010 national census conducted by the Barbados Statistical Service reported a resident population of 277,821 , of which 144,803 were female and 133,018 were male .
The life expectancy for Barbados residents is 79 years . The average life expectancy is 83 years for females and 78 years for males ( 2019 ) . Barbados and Japan have the highest per capita occurrences of centenarians in the world .
The crude birth rate is 12.23 births per 1,000 people , and the crude death rate is 8.39 deaths per 1,000 people . The infant mortality rate is 11.63 infant deaths per 1,000 live births .
=== Ethnic groups ===
Close to 90 % of all Barbadians ( also known colloquially as `` Bajan '' ) are of Afro-Caribbean descent ( `` Afro-Barbadian Afro-Bajans '' ) and mixed descent . The remainder of the population includes groups of Europeans ( `` Anglo-Bajans '' / `` Euro-Bajans '' ) mainly from the United Kingdom and Ireland , Italians , and Asians , predominantly Chinese and Indians ( both Hindu and Muslim ) .
Other groups in Barbados include people from the United Kingdom , United States and Canada . Barbadians who return after years of residence in the United States and children born in America to Bajan parents are called `` Bajan Yankees '' , a term considered derogatory by some . Generally , Bajans recognise and accept all `` children of the island '' as Bajans , and refer to each other as such .
The biggest communities outside the Afro-Caribbean community are :
# The Indo-Guyanese , an important part of the economy due to the increase of immigrants from partner country Guyana . There are reports of a growing Indians in Barbados Indo-Bajans diaspora originating from Guyana and India starting around 1990 . Predominantly from southern India , they are growing in size but are smaller than the equivalent communities in Trinidad and Guyana . People who are Indians in the Caribbean are also referred to as coolie who are Indians that came from East India to the Americas as labourers . They sometimes get mixed up with dougla who have African and Indian ancestry while coolies are full blooded Indians . The Muslim Barbadians of Indian origin are largely of Gujarati ancestry . Many small businesses in Barbados are run and operated by Muslim-Indian Bajans .
# Euro-Bajans ( 5 % of the population ) have settled in Barbados since the 17th century , originating from England , Ireland , Portugal , and Scotland . In 1643 , there were 37,200 whites in Barbados ( 86 % of the population ) . More commonly they are known as `` White Barbadian '' . Euro-Bajans introduced folk music , such as Irish music and Highland music , and certain place names , such as `` Scotland District '' , a hilly region in the parish of St. Andrew . Among White Barbadians there exists an underclass known as Redlegs comprising followers of the Duke of Monmouth after his defeat at the Battle of Sedgemoor , as well as the descendants of Irish people indentured labourers and prisoners imported to the island . Many additionally moved on to become the earliest settlers of modern-day Province of Carolina and Colonial period of South Carolina in the United States . Today the Redlegs only number around 400.
# Chinese-Barbadians are a small portion of Barbados 's wider Asian population . Most if not all first arrived in the 1940s from Hong Kong during the Second World War . Many Chinese-Bajans have the surnames Chin , Chynn or Lee , although other surnames prevail in certain areas of the island . Chinese food and culture is becoming part of everyday Bajan culture .
# Lebanese and Syrians form the island 's Arab Barbadian community , which is overwhelmingly Christian Arab . The Muslim Arab minority among Arab Barbadian make up a small percentage of the overall minority Muslim Barbadian population . The majority of the Lebanese and Syrians arrived in Barbados through trade opportunities . Their numbers are falling due to emigration to other countries .
# Jews arrived in Barbados just after the first settlers in 1627 . Bridgetown is the home of Nidhe Israel Synagogue , one of the oldest Jewish synagogues in the Americas , dating from 1654 , though the current structure was erected in 1833 , replacing one ruined by the hurricane of 1831 . Tombstones in the neighbouring cemetery date from the 1630s . Now under the care of the Barbados National Trust , the site was deserted in 1929 but was saved and restored by the Jewish community beginning in 1986.
# In the seventeenth century , Romani people were sent from the United Kingdom to work as slaves in the plantations in Barbados .
=== Languages ===
English is the official language of Barbados , and is used for communications , administration , and public services all over the island . In its capacity as the official language of the country , the standard of English tends to conform to the vocabulary , pronunciations , spellings , and conventions akin to , but not exactly the same as , those of British English .
=== Religion ===
Most Barbadians of African and European descent are Christians ( 95 % ) , the largest denomination being Anglican Communion ( 40 % ) . Other Christian denominations with significant followings in Barbados are the Catholic Church ( administered by Roman Catholic Diocese of Bridgetown ) , Pentecostals , Jehovah 's Witnesses , the Seventh-day Adventist Church and Spiritual Baptists . The Church of England was the official state religion until its legal disestablishment by the Parliament of Barbados following independence .
Other religions in Barbados include Hinduism , Islam in Barbados , the Bah Faith , and History of the Jews in Barbados .
== Government and politics ==
Barbados has been an independent country since 30 November 1966 . It functions as a constitutional monarchy and parliamentary democracy modelled on the British Westminster system . The Queen of Barbados , Elizabeth II , is [ of state ] and is represented locally by the Governor-General of Barbadospresently Sandra Mason . Both are advised on matters of the Barbadian state by the Prime Minister of Barbados , who is [ of government ] . There are 30 representatives within the Barbados House of Assembly .
The Constitution of Barbados is the supreme law of the nation . The Attorney General heads Judiciary of Barbados . New Acts are passed by the Barbadian Parliament and require royal assent by the governor-general to become law .
During the 1990s at the suggestion of Trinidad and Tobago 's Patrick Manning , Barbados attempted a political union with Trinidad and Tobago and Guyana . The project stalled after the then prime minister of Barbados , Lloyd Erskine Sandiford , became ill and his Democratic Labour Party ( Barbados ) lost the next general election . Barbados continues to share close ties with Trinidad and Tobago and with Guyana , claiming the highest number of Guyanese immigrants after the United States , Canada and the United Kingdom .

=== Foreign relations ===
Barbados follows a policy of Non-Aligned Movement and seeks cooperative relations with all friendly states . Barbados is a full and participating member of the Caribbean Community ( CARICOM ) , CARICOM Single Market and Economy ( CSME ) , and the Association of Caribbean States ( ACS ) . Organization of American States ( OAS ) , Commonwealth of Nations , and the Caribbean Court of Justice ( CCJ ) . In 2005 the Parliament of Barbados voted on a measure replacing the UK 's Judicial Committee of the Privy Council with the Caribbean Court of Justice based in Port of Spain , Trinidad and Tobago .
==== World Trade Organization , European Commission , CARIFORUM ====
Barbados is an original member ( 1995 ) of the World Trade Organization ( WTO ) and participates actively in its work . It grants at least MFN treatment to all its trading partners . European Union relations and cooperation with Barbados are carried out both on a bilateral and a regional basis . Barbados is party to the Cotonou Agreement , through which it is linked by an Economic Partnership Agreement with the European Commission . The pact involves the Caribbean Forum ( CARIFORUM ) subgroup of the African , Caribbean and Pacific Group of States ( ACP ) . CARIFORUM is the only part of the wider ACP-bloc that has concluded the full regional trade-pact with the European Union . There are also ongoing EU-Community of Latin American and Caribbean States ( CELAC ) and EU-CARIFORUM dialogues .
Trade policy has also sought to protect a small number of domestic activities , mostly food production , from foreign competition , while recognising that most domestic needs are best met by imports .
==== The Double Taxation Relief ( CARICOM ) Treaty 1994 ====
On 6 July 1994 , at the Sherbourne Conference Centre , St. Michael , Barbados , representatives of eight ( 8 ) countries signed the Double Taxation Relief ( CARICOM ) Treaties 1994 . The countries which were represented were : Antigua and Barbuda , Belize , Grenada , Jamaica , St. Kitts and Nevis , St. Lucia , St. Vincent and the Grenadines and Trinidad and Tobago .

Historically , the economy of Barbados had been dependent on sugarcane cultivation and related activities , but since the late 1970s and early 1980s it has diversified into the manufacturing and tourism sectors . Offshore finance and information services have become important foreign exchange earners , and there is a healthy light manufacturing sector . Since the 1990s the Barbados Government has been seen as business-friendly and economically sound . The island saw a construction boom , with the development and redevelopment of hotels , office complexes , and homes , partly due to the staging of the 2007 Cricket World Cup . This slowed during the 2008 to 2012 world economic crisis and the recession .
There was a strong economy between 1999 and 2000 but the economy went into recession in 2001 and 2002 due to slowdowns in tourism , consumer spending and the impact of the 11 September 2001 attacks in the United States and the 7 July 2005 London bombings in the United Kingdom . The economy rebounded in 2003 and has shown growth since 2004 which continued right through to 2008 . The economy went into recession again from 2008 to 2013 before showing growth from 2014 to 2017 . Then it declined to another recession from 2017 to 2019 during the world economic crisis . There were 23 downgrades by both Standard & Poor 's and Moody 's in 2016 , 2017 and 2018 . The economy showed signs of recovery with 3 upgrades from Standard and Poor 's and Moody 's in 2019 . From 1 January to 31 March 2020 the economy had started to grow , but then it experienced another decline due to the COVID-19 recession COVID-19 economic recession .

Although Barbados is about across at its widest point , a car journey from Six Cross Roads in St. Philip ( south-east ) to North Point in St. Lucy ( north-central ) can take one and a half hours or longer due to traffic . Barbados has half as many registered cars as citizens . In Barbados , drivers drive on the left side of the road .
Barbados is known for its many roundabouts . One famous roundabout is a roundabout located east of Bridgetown , where you will see an emancipation statue of a slave named Bussa .
Transport on the island is relatively convenient with `` share taxis '' called `` ZRs '' ( pronounced `` Zed-Rs '' ) travelling to most points on the island . These small buses can at times be crowded , as passengers are generally never turned down regardless of the number . They will usually take the more scenic routes to destinations . They generally depart from the capital Bridgetown or from Speightstown , Barbados in the northern part of the island .
Including the ZRs , there are three bus systems running seven days a week ( though less frequently on Sundays ) . There are ZRs , the yellow minibuses and the blue Barbados Transport Board . A ride on any of them costs . The smaller buses from the two privately owned systems ( `` ZRs '' and `` minibuses '' ) can give change ; the larger blue buses from the government-operated Barbados Transport Board system can not , but do give receipts . The Barbados Transport Board buses travel in regular bus routes and scheduled timetables across Barbados . Schoolchildren in school uniform including some Secondary schools ride for free on the government buses and for on the ZRs . Most routes require a connection in Bridgetown .

Djibouti , officially the Republic of Djibouti , is a country located in the Horn of Africa . It is bordered by Somaliland in the south , Ethiopia in the southwest , Eritrea in the north , and the Red Sea and the Gulf of Aden in the east . Across the Gulf of Aden is Yemen . The country has a total area of . The Republic of Djibouti is predominantly inhabited by two ethnic groups , the Somalis and the Afar people people , with the former comprising the majority of the population .
In antiquity , the territory together with Ethiopia , Eritrea and Somalia was part of the Land of Punt . Nearby Zeila , now in Somalia , was the seat of the medieval Adal Sultanate and Ifat Sultanate Sultanates . In the late 19th century , the colony of French Somaliland was established following treaties signed by the ruling Dir ( clan ) Somali people sultans with the French and its Imperial Ethiopian Railway to Dire Dawa ( and later Addis Ababa ) allowed it to quickly supersede Zeila as the port for southern Ethiopia and the Ogaden . It was subsequently renamed to the French Territory of the Afars and the Issas in 1967 . A decade later , the Djiboutian people voted for independence . This officially marked the establishment of the Republic of Djibouti , named after its Djibouti ( city ) . The new state joined the United Nations the same year , on 20 September 1977 . In the early 1990s , tensions over government representation led to Djiboutian Civil War , which ended in a power-sharing agreement in 2000 between the ruling party and the opposition .
Djibouti is a multi-ethnic nation with a population of over 921,804 inhabitants ( List of sovereign states and dependent territories in Africa in mainland Africa ) . Somali and Arabic are the country 's two official languages . About 94 % of residents adhere to Islam , which is the official religion and has been predominant in the region for more than a thousand years . The Somalis and Afar people make up the two largest ethnic groups . Both speak the Cushitic languages branch of the Afroasiatic languages .
Djibouti is strategically located near some of the world 's busiest shipping lanes , controlling access to the Red Sea and Indian Ocean . It serves as a key refuelling and transshipment center , and is the principal maritime port for imports from and exports to neighboring Ethiopia . A burgeoning commercial hub , the nation is the site of various foreign military bases , including Camp Lemonnier . The Intergovernmental Authority on Development ( IGAD ) regional body also has its headquarters in Djibouti City .
==Name and etymology==
Djibouti is officially known as the Republic of Djibouti . In local languages it is known as Yibuuti ( in Afar language ) and Jabuuti ( in Somali language ) .
The country is named for its capital , the Djibouti ( city ) . The etymology of the name is disputed . Several theories and legends exist regarding its origin , varying based on ethnicity . One theory derives it from the Afar language word , meaning `` plate '' , possibly referring to the geographical features of the area . Another connects it to gabood , meaning `` upland/plateau '' . Djibouti could also mean `` Land of Tehuti '' or `` Land of Thoth ( Egyptian language : Djehuti/ Djehuty ) '' , after the Ancient Egyptian religion Moon God .
From 1862 until 1894 , the land to the north of the Gulf of Tadjoura was called `` Obock Region '' . Under French administration , from 1883 to 1967 the area was known as French Somaliland ( French : Cte franaise des Somalis ) , and from 1967 to 1977 as the French Territory of the Afars and the Issas ( French : Territoire franais des Afars et des Issas ) .
==History==
===Prehistory===
The Bab-el-Mandeb region has often been considered a primary crossing point for early hominins following a southern coastal route from East Africa to South Asia and Southeast Asia .
The Djibouti area has been inhabited since the Neolithic . According to linguists , the first Afroasiatic languages-speaking populations arrived in the region during this period from the family 's proposed Afroasiatic Urheimat ( `` original homeland '' ) in the Nile Valley , or the Near East . Other scholars propose that the Afroasiatic family developed in situ in the Horn , with its speakers subsequently dispersing from there .
Cut stones dated about 3 million years old have been collected in the area of Lake Abbe . In the Gobaad plain ( between Dikhil and Lake Abbe ) , the remains of a Palaeoloxodon recki were also discovered , visibly butchered using basalt tools found nearby . These remains would date from 1.4 million years BCE . Subsequently , other similar sites were identified as probably the work of Homo ergaster . An Acheulean site ( from 800,000 to 400,000 years BCE ) , where stone was cut , was excavated in the 1990s , in Gombourta , between Damerdjog and Loyada , 15 km south of Djibouti City . Finally , in Gobaad , a Homo erectus jaw was found , dating from 100,000 BCE . On Ghoubbet-el-Kharab Devil 's Island , tools dating back 6,000 years have been found , which were used to open shells . In the area at the bottom of Ghoubbet-el-Kharab ( Dankallo , not far from Devil 's Island ) , circular stone structures and fragments of painted pottery have also been discovered . Previous investigators have also reported a fragmentary maxilla , attributed to an older form of Homo sapiens and dated to ~250 Ka , from the valley of the Dagadl Wadi .
Pottery predating the mid-2nd millennium has been found at Asa Koma , an inland lake area on the Gobaad Plain . The site 's ware is characterized by punctate and incision geometric designs , which bear a similarity to the Sabir culture phase 1 ceramics from Ma'layba in Southern Arabia . Long-horned humpless cattle bones have likewise been discovered at Asa Koma , suggesting that domesticated cattle were present by around 3,500 years ago . Rock art of what appear to be antelopes and a giraffe are also found at Dorra and Balho . Handoga , dated to the fourth millennium BCE , has in turn yielded obsidian microliths and plain ceramics used by early nomadic pastoralists with domesticated cattle .
The site of Wakrita is a small Neolithic establishment located on a wadi in the tectonic depression of Gobaad in Djibouti in the Horn of Africa . The 2005 excavations yielded abundant ceramics that enabled us to define one Neolithic cultural facies of this region , which was also identified at the nearby site of Asa Koma . The faunal remains confirm the importance of fishing in Neolithic settlements close to Lake Abbe , but also the importance of bovine husbandry and , for the first time in this area , evidence for caprine herding practices . Radiocarbon dating places this occupation at the beginning of the 2nd millennium BCE , similar in range to Asa Koma . These two sites represent the oldest evidence of herding in the region , and they provide a better understanding of the development of Neolithic societies in this region .
Up to 4000 years BCE , the region benefited from a climate very different from the one it knows today and probably close to the Mediterranean climate . The water resources were numerous with lakes in Gobaad , lakes Assal and Abb larger and resembling real bodies of water . The humans therefore lived by gathering , fishing and hunting . The region was populated by a very rich fauna : Felidae , African Buffaloes , elephants , rhinos , etc. , as evidenced , for example , by the bestiary of cave paintings at Balho . In the 3rd and 2nd millennia BCE , few nomads settled around the lakes and practiced fishing and cattle ] ] breeding . The burial of an 18-year-old woman , dating from this period , as well as the bones of hunted animals , bone tools and small Gemstone have been unearthed . By about 1500 BCE , the climate was already beginning to change , with sources of fresh water becoming more scarce . Engravings show dromedaries ( animal of arid zones ) , some of which are ridden by armed warriors . The sedentary people now returned to a nomadic life . Stone tumuli of various shapes and sheltering graves dating from this period have been unearthed all over the territory .
===Punt ( 2,500 BCE ) ===
Together with northern Ethiopia , northern Somalia ] , Eritrea and the Red Sea coast of Sudan , Djibouti is considered the most likely location of the territory known to the Ancient Egyptians as Land of Punt ( or Ta Netjeru , meaning `` God 's Land '' ) . The first mention of the Land of Punt dates to the 25th century BC . The Puntites were a nation of people who had close relations with Ancient Egypt during the reign of the 5th dynasty Pharaoh Sahure and the 18th dynasty Queen Hatshepsut . According to the temple murals at Deir el-Bahari , the Land of Punt was ruled at that time by King Parahu and Queen Ati .
===Macrobians ( 247 BCE ) ===
The Macrobians (  ) were a legendary people and kingdom positioned in the Horn of Africa mentioned by Herodotus . Later authors ( so Pliny the Elder on the authority of Ctesias ' Indica ( Ctesias ) ) place them in India ( Herodotus ) instead . It is one of the legendary peoples postulated at the extremity of the Ecumene ( from the perspective of the Greeks ) , in this case in the extreme south , contrasting with the Hyperboreans in the extreme east . Their name is due to their legendary longevity , an average person supposedly living to the age of 120 . They were said to be the `` tallest and handsomest of all men '' . According to Herodotus ' account , the Persian Emperor Cambyses II upon his History of Achaemenid Egypt ( 525 BC ) sent ambassadors to Macrobia , bringing luxury gifts for the Macrobian king to entice his submission . The Macrobian ruler , who was elected based at least in part on stature , replied instead with a challenge for his Persian counterpart in the form of an unstrung bow : if the Persians could manage to string it , they would have the right to invade his country ; but until then , they should thank the gods that the Macrobians never decided to invade their empire .
===Kingdom of Adal ( 9001285 ) ===
The Kingdom of Adal ( also Awdal , Adl , or Adel ) was centered around Zeila , its capital . It was established by the local Somalis tribes in the early 9th century . Zeila attracted merchants from around the world , contributing to the wealth of the city . Zeila is an ancient city and it was one of the earliest cities in the world to embrace Islam , shortly after the Hijra ( Islam ) . Zeila 's two-mihrab Masjid al-Qiblatayn ( Somalia ) Masjid al-Qiblatayn dates to the 7th century , and is the oldest mosque .
In the late 9th century , Al-Yaqubi , an Armenian Muslim scholar and traveler , wrote that the Kingdom of Adal was a small wealthy kingdom and that Zeila served as the headquarters for the kingdom , which dated back to the beginning of the century .
===Ifat Sultanate ( 12851415 ) ===
Through close contacts with the adjacent Arabian Peninsula for more than 1,000 years , the Somali and Afar ethnic groups in the region became among the first populations on the continent to embrace Islam . The Ifat Sultanate was a Muslim medieval kingdom in the Horn of Africa . Founded in 1285 by the Walashma dynasty , it was centered in Zeila . Ifat established bases in Djibouti and northern Somalia , and from there expanded southward to the Ahmar Mountains . Its Sultan Umar Walashma ( or his son Ali , according to another source ) is recorded as having conquered the Sultanate of Showa in 1285 . Taddesse Tamrat explains Sultan Umar 's military expedition as an effort to consolidate the Muslim territories in the Horn , in much the same way as Emperor Yekuno Amlak was attempting to unite the Christian territories in the highlands during the same period . These two states inevitably came into conflict over Shewa and territories further south . A lengthy war ensued , but the Muslim sultanates of the time were not strongly unified . Ifat was finally defeated by Emperor Amda Seyon I of Ethiopia in 1332 , and withdrew from Shewa .
===Adal Sultanate ( 14151577 ) ===
According to the 16th-century explorer Leo Africanus , the Adal Sultanate 's realm encompassed the geographical area between the Bab el Mandeb and Cape Guardafui . It was therefore flanked to the south by the Ajuran Empire ( Kingdom of Ajuuran ) and to the west by the Abyssinian Empire ( Abassin Empire ) . Adal is mentioned by name in the 14th century in the context of the battles between the Muslims of the Somali and Afar seaboard and the Abyssinian King Amda Seyon I 's Christians troops . Adal originally had its capital in the port city of Zeila , situated in the northwestern Awdal region . The polity at the time was an Emirate in the larger Sultanate of Ifat ruled by the Walashma dynasty .
According to I.M . Lewis , the polity was governed by local dynasties consisting of Afarized Arabs or Arabized Somalis , who also ruled over the similarly-established Sultanate of Mogadishu in the Benadir region to the south . Adal 's history from this founding period forth would be characterized by a succession of battles with neighbouring Ethiopian Empire . At its height , the Adal kingdom controlled large parts of modern-day Djibouti , Somalia , Eritrea and Ethiopia . Between Djibouti City and Loyada are a number of anthropomorphic and phallic Stele . The structures are associated with graves of rectangular shape flanked by vertical slabs , as also found in Tiya , central Ethiopia . The Djibouti-Loyada stelae are of uncertain age , and some of them are adorned with a T-shaped symbol . Additionally , archaeological excavations at Tiya have yielded tombs . As of 1997 , 118 stelae were reported in the area . Along with the stelae in the Hadiya Zone , the structures are identified by local residents as Yegragn Dingay or `` Gran 's stone '' , in reference to Imam Ahmad ibn Ibrahim al-Ghazi ( Ahmad `` Gurey '' or `` Gran '' ) , ruler of the Adal Sultanate .
===Ottoman Eyalet ( 15771867 ) ===
Although nominally part of the Ottoman Empire since 1577 , between 1821 and 1841 , Muhammad Ali of Egypt , Pasha of Egypt , came to control Yemen , Harar , Gulf of Tadjoura with Zeila and Berbera included . The Governor Abou Baker ordered the Egyptian garrison at Sagallo to retire to Zeila . The cruiser Seignelay reached Sagallo shortly after the Egyptians had departed . French troops occupied the fort despite protests from the British Agent in Aden , Major Frederick Mercer Hunter , who dispatched troops to safeguard British and Egyptian interests in Zeila and prevent further extension of French influence in that direction .
On 14 April 1884 the Commander of the patrol sloop L'Inferent reported on the Egyptian occupation in the Gulf of Tadjoura . The Commander of the patrol sloop Le Vaudreuil reported that the Egyptians were occupying the interior between Obock and Tadjoura . Emperor Yohannes IV of Ethiopia signed an accord with Great Britain to cease fighting the Egyptians and to allow the evacuation of Egyptian forces from Ethiopia and the Somalia littoral . The Egyptian garrison was withdrawn from Tadjoura . Lonce Lagarde deployed a patrol sloop to Tadjoura the following night .
===French Somaliland ( 18831977 ) ===
The boundaries of the present-day Djibouti state were established as the first French establishment in the Horn of Africa during the Scramble for Africa . The March 11 , 1862 , agreement the Afar people sultan , Raieta Dini Ahmet , signed in Paris was a treaty where the Afars sold lands surrounding in Obock . The French were interested in having a coaling station for steamships , which would become especially important upon the opening of the Suez Canal in 1869 . ( Up to that time French ships had to buy coal at the British port of Aden across the gulf , an unwise dependency in case of war . ) Later on , that treaty was used by the captain of the Fleuriot de Langle to colonize the south of the Gulf of Tadjoura . On March 26 , 1885 the French signed another treaty with the Issas where the latter would become a protectorate under the French , no monetary exchange occurred and Issa clan did not sign away any of their rights to the land , the agreement was to protect their land from outsiders with the help of the French . It was established between 1883 and 1887 , after the ruling Somali people and Afar people sultans each signed a treaty with the French Third Republic . An attempt by Nikolay Ivanovitch Achinov , a Russian Empire adventurer , to establish a settlement at Sagallo in 1889 was promptly thwarted by French forces after just one month . In 1894 , Lonce Lagarde established a permanent French administration in the city of Djibouti and named the region French Somaliland . As is shown in `` Morin '' ( 2005 ) , this name has been proposed by Mohamed Haji Dide of the Mahad 'Ase branch of the Gadabuursi . It lasted from 1896 until 1967 , when it was renamed the Territoire Franais des Afars et des Issas ( TFAI ) ( `` French Territory of the Afars and the Issas '' ) , after France , the colonial power , has empowered the Issas clan at the expense of the Gadabuursi .
The construction of the Imperial Ethiopian Railway west into Ethiopia turned the Djibouti ( city ) into a boomtown of 15,000 at a time when Harar was the only city in Ethiopia to exceed that .
Although the population fell after the completion of the railwayline to Dire Dawa and the original company failed and required a government bail-out , the rail link allowed the territory to quickly supersede the caravan-based trade carried on at Zeila ( then in the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland area of British Somaliland ) and become the premier port for Harari coffee and other goods leaving southern Ethiopia and the Ogaden through Harar .
After the Italian Second Italo-Abyssinian War in the mid-1930s , constant border skirmishes occurred between French forces in French Somaliland and Italian forces in Italian East Africa . In June 1940 , during the early stages of World War II , fall of France and the colony was then ruled by the pro-Axis powers Vichy France Vichy ( French ) government .
British and Commonwealth forces fought the neighboring Italians during the East African Campaign ( World War II ) . In 1941 , the Italians were defeated and the Vichy forces in French Somaliland were isolated . The Vichy French administration continued to hold out in the colony for over a year after the Italian collapse . In response , the British blockaded the port of Djibouti City but it could not prevent local French from providing information on the passing ship convoys . In 1942 , about 4,000 British troops occupied the city . A local battalion from French Somaliland participated in the Liberation of Paris in 1944.
In 1958 , on the eve of neighboring Somalia 's independence in 1960 , a French Somaliland overseas territory referendum , 1958 was held in Djibouti to decide whether to remain with France or to be an independent country . The referendum turned out in favour of a continued association with France , partly due to a combined yes vote by the sizable Afar ethnic group and resident French . There were also allegations of widespread vote rigging . The majority of those who had voted no were Somalis who were strongly in favour of joining a united Somalia as had been proposed by Mahmoud Harbi , Vice President of the Government Council . Harbi was killed in a plane crash two years later under suspicious circumstances .
In 1966 , France rejected the United Nations ' recommendation that it should grant French Somaliland independence . In August of the same year , an official visit to the territory by then French President , General Charles de Gaulle , was also met with demonstrations and rioting . In response to the protests , de Gaulle ordered another referendum .
In 1967 , a French Somaliland independence referendum , 1967 was held to determine the fate of the territory . Initial results supported a continued but looser relationship with France . Voting was also divided along ethnic lines , with the resident Somalis generally voting for independence , with the goal of eventual union with Somalia , and the Afars largely opting to remain associated with France . The referendum was again marred by reports of vote rigging on the part of the French authorities . Shortly after the plebiscite was held , the former Cte franaise des Somalis ( French Somaliland ) was renamed to Territoire franais des Afars et des Issas . Announcement of the plebiscite results sparked civil unrest , including several deaths . France also increased its military force along the frontier .
Djibouti is partitioned into six administrative regions , with Djibouti ( city ) representing one of the official regions . It is further subdivided into twenty Districts of Djibouti .
== Geography ==
=== Location and habitat ===
Djibouti is situated in the Horn of Africa on the Gulf of Aden and the Bab-el-Mandeb , at the southern entrance to the Red Sea . It lies between latitudes 11 and 14N and longitudes 41 and 44E , at the northernmost point of the Great Rift Valley . It is here in Djibouti that the rift between the African Plate and the Somali Plate meet the Arabian Plate , forming a geologic tripoint . The tectonic interaction at this tripoint has created the Extreme points of Africa at Lake Assal ( Djibouti ) , and indeed , the second lowest depression on dry land found anywhere on earth ( surpassed only by the depression along the border of Jordan and Israel ) .
The country 's coastline stretches , with terrain consisting mainly of plateau , plains and highlands . Djibouti has a total area of . Its borders extend , of which are shared with Eritrea , with Ethiopia , and with Somaliland . Djibouti is the southernmost Arabian Plate country .
Djibouti has eight mountain ranges with peaks of over . The Mousa Ali range is considered the country 's highest mountain range , with the tallest peak on the border with Ethiopia and Eritrea . It has an elevation of . The Grand Bara desert covers parts of southern Djibouti in the Arta , Ali Sabieh and Dikhil regions . The majority of it sits at a relatively low elevation , below .
Extreme geographic points include : to the north , Ras Doumera and the point at which the border with Eritrea enters the Red Sea in the Obock Region ; to the east , a section of the Red Sea coast north of Ras Bir ; to the south , a location on the border with Ethiopia west of the town of As Ela ; and to the west , a location on the frontier with Ethiopia immediately east of the Ethiopian town of Afambo ( woreda ) .
Most of Djibouti is part of the Ethiopian xeric grasslands and shrublands ecoregion . The exception is an eastern strip located along the Red Sea coast , which is part of the Eritrean coastal desert .

=== Climate ===
Djibouti 's climate is significantly warmer and has significantly less seasonal variation than the world average . The mean daily maximum temperatures range from 32 to 41 ; C ( 90 to 106 ; F ) , except at high elevations . In Djibouti City , for instance , average afternoon highs range from 28 to 34 ; C ( 82 to 93 ; F ) in April . But at Airolaf , which ranges from 1,535 to 1,600 m ( 5,036 to 5,249 ; ft ) , maximum temperature is 30 ; C ( 86 ; F ) in summer and minimum 9 ; C ( 48 ; F ) in winter . In the wikt : uplands ranges from 500 to 800 m ( 1,640 to 2,624 ; ft ) , are comparable and cooler to those on the coast in the hottest months of June until August . December and January is the coolest month with averages low temperatures falling as low as 15 ; C ( 59 ; F ) . Djibouti has either a [ semi-arid climate ] ( BSh ) or a [ desert climate ] ( BWh ) , although temperatures are much moderated at the highest elevations .
Djibouti 's climate ranges from arid in the northeastern coastal regions to semiarid semi-arid in the central , northern , western and southern parts of the country . On the eastern seaboard , annual rainfall is less than 5 inches ( 131 ; mm ) ; in the central highlands , precipitation is about 8 to 16 inches ( 200 to 400 ; mm ) . The hinterland is significantly less [ than the coastal regions .
=== Wildlife ===
The country 's flora and fauna live in a harsh landscape with forest accounting for less than one percent of the total area of the country . Wildlife is spread over three main regions , namely from the northern mountain region of the country to the volcanic plateaux in its southern and central part and culminating in the coastal region .
Most species of wildlife are found in the northern part of the country , in the ecosystem of the Day Forest National Park . At an average altitude of , the area includes the Goda massif , with a peak of . It covers an area of of Juniperus procera forest , with many of the trees rising to height . This forest area is the main habitat of the endangered and endemic Djibouti francolin ( a bird ) , and another recently noted vertebrate , Platyceps afarensis ( a colubrine snake ) . It also contains many species of woody and herbaceous plants , including boxwood and olive trees , which account for 60 % of the total identified species in the country .
According to the country profile related to biodiversity of wildlife in Djibouti , the nation contains more than 820 species of plants , 493 species of invertebrates , 455 species of fish , 40 species of reptiles , three species of amphibians , 360 species of birds and 66 species of mammals . Wildlife of Djibouti is also listed as part of Horn of Africa biodiversity hotspot and the Red Sea and Gulf of Aden coral reef hotspot . Mammals include several species of antelope , such as Soemmerring 's gazelle and Pelzeln 's gazelle . As a result of the hunting ban imposed since early 1970 these species are well conserved now . Other characteristic mammals are Grevy 's zebra , [ baboon ] and Hunter 's antelope . The warthog , a vulnerable species , is also found in the Day National park . The coastal waters have dugongs and Abyssinian genet ; the latter needs confirmation by further studies . Green turtles and [ turtle ] s are in the coastal waters where nestling also takes place . The Northeast African cheetah Acinonyx jubatus soemmeringii is thought to be extinct in Djibouti .
==Economy==
Djibouti 's economy is largely concentrated in the service sector . Commercial activities revolve around the country 's free trade policies and strategic location as a Red Sea transit point . Due to limited rainfall , vegetables and fruits are the principal production crops , and other food items require importation . The GDP ( purchasing power parity ) in 2013 was estimated at $ 2.505 ; billion , with a real growth rate of 5 % annually . Per capita income is around $ 2,874 ( PPP ) . The services sector constituted around 79.7 % of the GDP , followed by industry at 17.3 % , and agriculture at 3 % .
, the container terminal at the Port of Djibouti handles the bulk of the nation 's trade . About 70 % of the seaport 's activity consists of imports to and exports from neighboring Ethiopia , which depends on the harbour as its main maritime outlet . As of 2018 , 95 % of Ethiopian transit cargo was handled by the Port of Djibouti . The port also serves as an international refueling center and transshipment hub . In 2012 , the Djiboutian government in collaboration with DP World started construction of the Doraleh Container Terminal , a third major seaport intended to further develop the national transit capacity . A $ 396 ; million project , it has the capacity to accommodate 1.5 ; million twenty foot container units annually .
Djibouti was ranked the 177th safest investment destination in the world in the March 2011 Euromoney Country Risk rankings . To improve the environment for direct foreign investment , the Djibouti authorities in conjunction with various non-profit organizations have launched a number of development projects aimed at highlighting the country 's commercial potential . The government has also introduced new private sector policies targeting high interest and inflation rates , including relaxing the tax burden on enterprises and allowing exemptions on consumption tax .
Additionally , efforts have been made to lower the estimated 60 % urban unemployment rate by creating more job opportunities through investment in diversified sectors . Funds have especially gone toward building telecommunications infrastructure and increasing disposable income by supporting small businesses . Owing to its growth potential , the fishing and agro-processing sector , which represents around 15 % of GDP , has also enjoyed rising investment since 2008.
To expand the modest industrial sector , a 56 megawatt geothermal power plant slated to be completed by 2018 is being constructed with the help of OPEC , the World Bank and the Global Environmental Facility . The facility is expected to solve the recurring electricity shortages , decrease the nation 's reliance on Ethiopia for energy , reduce costly oil imports for diesel-generated electricity , and thereby buttress the GDP and lower debt .
The Djibouti firm Salt Investment ( SIS ) began a large-scale operation to industrialize the plentiful salt in Djibouti 's Lake Assal ( Djibouti ) region . Operating at an annual capacity of 4 million tons , the desalination project has lifted export revenues , created more job opportunities , and provided more fresh water for the area 's residents . In 2012 , the Djibouti government also enlisted the services of the China Harbor Engineering Company Ltd for the construction of an ore terminal . Worth $ 64 ; million , the project enabled Djibouti to export a further 5,000 tons of salt per year to markets in Southeast Asia .
Djibouti 's gross domestic product expanded by an average of more than 6 percent per year , from US $ 341 ; million in 1985 to US $ 1.5 ; billion in 2015 . The Djiboutian franc is the currency of Djibouti . It is issued by the Central Bank of Djibouti , the country 's monetary authority . Since the Djiboutian franc is pegged to the U.S. dollar , it is generally stable and inflation is not a problem . This has contributed to the growing interest in investment in the country .
, 10 conventional and Islamic banks operate in Djibouti . Most arrived within the past few years , including the Somali money transfer company Dahabshiil and BDCD , a subsidiary of Swiss Financial Investments . The banking system had previously been monopolized by two institutions : the Indo-Suez Bank and the Commercial and Industrial Bank ( BCIMR ) . To assure a robust credit and deposit sector , the government requires commercial banks to maintain 30 % of shares in the financial institution ; a minimum of 300 million Djiboutian francs in up-front capital is mandatory for international banks . Lending has likewise been encouraged by the creation of a guarantee fund , which allows banks to issue loans to eligible small- and medium-sized businesses without first requiring a large deposit or other collateral .
Saudi investors are also reportedly exploring the possibility of linking the Horn of Africa with the Arabian Peninsula via a oversea bridge through Djibouti , referred to as the Bridge of the Horns . The investor Tarek bin Laden has been linked to the project . However , it was announced in June 2010 that Phase I of the project had been delayed .
===Transport===
The DjiboutiAmbouli International Airport in Djibouti City , the country 's only international airport , serves many intercontinental routes with scheduled and chartered flights . Air Djibouti is the flag carrier of Djibouti and is the country 's largest airline .
The new and electrified standard gauge Addis Ababa-Djibouti Railway started operation in January 2018 . Its main purpose is to facilitate freight services between the Ethiopian hinterland and the Djiboutian Port of Doraleh .
Car ferries pass the Gulf of Tadjoura from Djibouti City to Tadjoura . There is the Port of Doraleh west of Djibouti City , which is the main port of Djibouti . The Port of Doraleh is the terminal of the new Addis AbabaDjibouti Railway . In addition to the Port of Doraleh , which handles general cargo and oil imports , Djibouti ( 2018 ) has three other major ports for the import and export of bulk goods and livestock , the Tadjoura ( potash ) , the Damerjog ( livestock ) and the Port of Goubet ( salt ) . Almost 95 % of Ethiopia 's imports and exports move through Djiboutian ports .
The Djiboutian highway system is named according to the road classification . Roads that are considered primary roads are those that are fully asphalted ( throughout their entire length ) and in general they carry traffic between all the major towns in Djibouti .
Djibouti is part of the 21st Century Maritime Silk Road that runs from the Chinese coast to the Upper Adriatic region with its connections to Central and Eastern Europe .
===Media and telecommunications===
Telecommunications in Djibouti fall under the authority of the Ministry of Communication .
Djibouti Telecom is the sole provider of telecommunication services . It mostly utilizes a microwave radio relay network . A fiber-optic cable is installed in the capital , whereas rural areas are connected via wireless local loop radio systems . Mobile cellular coverage is primarily limited to the area in and around Djibouti city . , 23,000 telephone main lines and 312,000 mobile/cellular lines were in use . The SEA-ME-WE 3 ( cable system ) SEA-ME-WE 3 Submarine communications cable operates to Jeddah , Suez , Sicily , Marseille , Colombo , Singapore and beyond . Telephone satellite earth stations include 1 Intelsat ( Indian Ocean ) and 1 Arabsat . Medarabtel is the regional microwave radio relay telephone network .
Radio Television of Djibouti is the state-owned national broadcaster . It operates the sole terrestrial TV station , as well as the two domestic radio networks on AM broadcasting 1 , FM broadcasting 2 , and shortwave 0 . Licensing and operation of broadcast media is regulated by the government . Movie theaters include the Odeon Cinema in the capital .
, there were 215 local internet service providers . Internet users comprised around 99,000 individuals ( 2015 ) . The internet country top-level domain is .dj .
===Tourism===
Tourism in Djibouti is one of the growing economic sectors of the country and is an industry that generates less than 80,000 arrivals per year , mostly the family and friends of the soldiers stationed in the country 's major naval bases . Although the numbers are on the rise , there are talks of the visa on arrival being stopped , which could limit tourism growth .
Infrastructure makes it difficult for tourists to travel independently and costs of private tours are high . Since the re-opening of the train line from Addis Ababa to Djibouti in January 2018 , travel by land has also resumed . Djibouti 's two main geological marvels , Lake Abbe and Lake Assal , are the country 's top tourist destinations . The two sites draw hundreds of tourists every year looking for remote places that are not visited by many .
===Energy===
Djibouti has an installed electrical power generating capacity of 126 MW from fuel oil and diesel plants . In 2002 electrical power output was put at 232 GWh , with consumption at 216 GWh . At 2015 , per capita annual electricity consumption is about 330 kilowatt-hours ( kWh ) ; moreover , about 45 % of the population does not have access to electricity , and the level of unmet demand in the country 's power sector is significant . Increased [ imports from Ethiopia ] , which satisfies 65 % of Djibouti 's demand , will play a significant role in boosting the country 's renewable energy supply . The geothermal potential has generated particular interest in Japan , with 13 potential sites ; they have already started the construction on one site near Lake Assal . The construction of the photovoltaic power station ( solar farms ) in Grand Bara will generate 50 MW capacity .
== Demographics ==
Djibouti has a population of about 921,804 inhabitants . It is a [ [ multiethnic country . The local population grew rapidly during the latter half of the 20th century , increasing from about 69,589 in 1955 to around 869,099 by 2015 . The two largest ethnic groups native to Djibouti are the Somalis ( 60 % ) and the Afar people ( 35 % ) . The Somali clan component is mainly composed of the Issa ( clan ) Dir ( clan ) , followed by a sizable group of Gadabuursi Dir ( clan ) and a smaller population of Isaaq , mainly the subclan Sacad Muuse . The remaining 5 % of Djibouti 's population primarily consists of Yemenis , People of Ethiopia and Europeans ( French people and Italians ) . Approximately 76 % of local residents are urban dwellers ; the remainder are Pastoralism . Djibouti also hosts a number of immigrants and refugees from neighboring states , with Djibouti City nicknamed the `` French Hong Kong in the Red Sea '' due to its cosmopolitan urbanism . Djibouti 's location on the eastern coast of Africa makes it a hub of regional Human migration , with Somalis , Yemenis , and Ethiopians traveling through the country en route to the Arab states of the Persian Gulf and North Africa . Djibouti has received a massive influx of migrants from Yemen .
=== Languages ===
Djibouti is a multilingual nation . The majority of local residents speak Somali language ( 524,000 speakers ) and Afar language ( 306,000 speakers ) as first languages . These idioms are the mother tongues of the Somali and Afar ethnic groups , respectively . Both languages belong to the larger Afroasiatic languages Cushitic family . There are two official languages in Djibouti : Arabic language and French language .
Arabic is of religious importance . In formal settings , it consists of Modern Standard Arabic . Colloquially , about 59,000 local residents speak the Ta'izzi-Adeni Arabic dialect , also known as Djibouti Arabic . French serves as a statutory national language . It was inherited from the colonial period , and is the primary language of instruction . Around 17,000 Djiboutians speak it as a first language . Immigrant languages include Omani Arabic ( 38,900 speakers ) , Amharic ( 1,400 speakers ) , and Greek language ( 1,000 speakers ) .
=== Religion ===
Djibouti 's population is predominantly Muslim . Islam is observed by around 94 % of the nation 's population ( approximately 740,000 ) , whereas the remaining 6 % of residents are Christian adherents .
Islam entered the region very early on , as a group of persecuted Muslims had sought refuge across the Red Sea in the Horn of Africa at the urging of the Islamic prophet Muhammad . In 1900 , during the early part of the colonial era , there were virtually no Christians in the territories , with only about 100300 followers coming from the schools and orphanages of the few Catholic missions in the French Somaliland . The Constitution of Djibouti names Islam as the sole state religion , and also provides for the equality of citizens of all faiths ( Article 1 ) and freedom of religious practice ( Article 11 ) . Most local Muslims adhere to the Sunni Islam denomination , following the Shafi ' i school . The non-denominational Muslims largely belong to Sufism orders of varying schools . According to the International Religious Freedom Report 2008 , while Muslim Djiboutians have the legal right to convert to or marry someone from another faith , converts may encounter negative reactions from their family and clan or from society at large , and they often face pressure to go back to Islam .
The Roman Catholic Diocese of Djibouti serves the small local Catholicism population , which it estimates numbered around 7,000 individuals in 2006.
=== Largest cities ===
=== Health ===
The life expectancy at birth is around 64.7 for both males and females . Fertility is at 2.35 children per woman . In Djibouti there are about 18 doctors per 100,000 persons .
The 2010 maternal mortality rate per 100,000 births for Djibouti is 300 . This is compared with 461.6 in 2008 and 606.5 in 1990 . The under 5 mortality rate , per 1,000 births is 95 and the neonatal mortality as a percentage of under 5 's mortality are 37 . In Djibouti the number of midwives per 1,000 live births is 6 and the lifetime risk of death for pregnant women 1 in 93.
About 93.1 % of Djibouti 's women and girls have undergone female genital mutilation ( female circumcision ) , a pre-marital custom mainly endemic to Northeast Africa and parts of the Near East . Although legally proscribed in 1994 , the procedure is still widely practiced , as it is deeply ingrained in the local culture . Encouraged and performed by women in the community , circumcision is primarily intended to deter promiscuity and to offer protection from assault .
About 94 % of Djibouti 's male population have also reportedly undergone Circumcision , a figure in line with adherence to Islam , which requires this .
=== Education ===
Education is a priority for the government of Djibouti . , it allocates 20.5 % of its annual budget to scholastic instruction .
The Djiboutian educational system was initially formulated to cater to a limited pupil base . As such , the schooling framework was largely elitist and drew considerably from the French colonial paradigm , which was ill-suited to local circumstances and needs .
In the late 1990s , the Djiboutian authorities revised the national educational strategy and launched a broad-based consultative process involving administrative officials , teachers , parents , national assembly members and NGOs . The initiative identified areas in need of attention and produced concrete recommendations on how to go about improving them . The government subsequently prepared a comprehensive reform plan aimed at modernizing the educational sector over the 200010 period . In August 2000 , it passed an official Education Planning Act and drafted a medium-term development plan for the next five years . The fundamental academic system was significantly restructured and made compulsory ; it now consists of five years of primary school and four years of middle school . Secondary schools also require a Certificate of Fundamental Education for admission . In addition , the new law introduced secondary-level vocational instruction and established university facilities in the country .
As a result of the Education Planning Act and the medium-term action strategy , substantial progress has been registered throughout the educational sector . In particular , school enrollment , attendance , and retention rates have all steadily increased , with some regional variation . From 2004 to 2005 to 200708 , net enrollments of girls in primary school rose by 18.6 % ; for boys , it increased 8.0 % . Net enrollments in middle school over the same period rose by 72.4 % for girls and 52.2 % for boys . At the secondary level , the rate of increase in net enrollments was 49.8 % for girls and 56.1 % for boys .
The Djiboutian government has especially focused on developing and improving institutional infrastructure and teaching materials , including constructing new classrooms and supplying textbooks . At the post-secondary level , emphasis has also been placed on producing qualified instructors and encouraging out-of-school youngsters to pursue vocational training . , the literacy rate in Djibouti was estimated at 70 % .
Institutions of higher learning in the country include the University of Djibouti .
== Culture ==
Djiboutian attire reflects the region 's hot and arid climate . When not dressed in Western clothing such as jeans and T-shirts , men typically wear the , which is a traditional sarong-like garment worn around the waist . Many nomadic people wear a loosely wrapped white cotton robe called a tobe that goes down to about the knee , with the end thrown over the shoulder ( much like a Roman toga ) .
Women typically wear the dirac , which is a long , light , diaphanous voile dress made of cotton or polyester that is worn over a full-length Slip ( clothing ) half-slip and a bra . Married women tend to sport head-scarves referred to as shash and often cover their upper body with a shawl known as garbasaar . Unmarried or young women , however , do not always cover their heads . Traditional Arabian garb such as the male jellabiya ( jellabiyaad in Somali ) and the female jilbb is also commonly worn . For some occasions such as festivals , women may adorn themselves with specialized jewelry and head-dresses similar to those worn by the Berber people tribes of the Maghreb .
A lot of Djibouti 's original art is passed on and preserved orally , mainly through song . Many examples of Islamic , Ottoman , and French influences can also be noted in the local buildings , which contain plasterwork , carefully constructed Motif ( visual arts ) , and calligraphy .
===Music===
Somalis have a rich musical heritage centered on traditional Somali folklore . Most Somali songs are Pentatonic scale . That is , they only use five Pitch ( music ) per octave in contrast to a Heptatonic scale ( seven note ) scale such as the major scale . At first listen , Somali music might be mistaken for the sounds of nearby regions such as Ethiopia , Sudan or the Arabian Peninsula , but it is ultimately recognizable by its own unique tunes and styles . Somali songs are usually the product of collaboration between lyricists ( ) , songwriters ( ) and singers ( or `` voice '' ) . Balwo is a Somali musical style centered on love themes that is popular in Djibouti .
Traditional Afar music resembles the folk music of other parts of the Horn of Africa such as Music of Ethiopia ; it also contains elements of Arabic music . The history of Djibouti is recorded in the poetry and songs of its nomadic people , and goes back thousands of years to a time when the peoples of Djibouti traded hides and skins for the perfumes and spices of ancient Egypt , India and China . Afar oral literature is also quite musical . It comes in many varieties , including songs for weddings , war , praise and boasting .
===Literature===
Djibouti has a long tradition of poetry . Several well-developed Somali forms of verse include the , , , , , , and . The ( epic poem ) has the most complex length and meter , often exceeding 100 lines .

Groups of memorizers and reciters ( ) traditionally propagated the well-developed art form . Poems revolve around several main themes , including ( elegy ) , ( praise ) , ( romance ) , ( diatribe ) , ( gloating ) and ( guidance ) . The baroorodiiq is composed to commemorate the death of a prominent poet or figure . The Afar are familiar with the , a kind of warrior-poet and diviner , and have a rich oral tradition of folk stories . They also have an extensive repertoire of battle songs .
Additionally , Djibouti has a long tradition of Islamic literature . Among the most prominent historical works is the medieval Futuh Al-Habash by Shihb al-Dn , which chronicles the Adal Sultanate army 's Ethiopian-Adal War during the 16th century . In recent years , a number of politicians and intellectuals have also penned memoirs or reflections on the country .
===Sport===
Football is the most popular sport amongst Djiboutians . The country became a member of FIFA in 1994 , but has only taken part in the qualifying rounds for the African Cup of Nations as well as the FIFA World Cup in the mid-2000s . In November 2007 , the Djibouti national football team beat Somalia national football team Somalia 's national squad 10 in the qualification rounds for the 2010 FIFA World Cup , marking its first ever World Cup-related win .
Recently , the World Archery Federation has helped to implement the Djibouti Archery Federation , and an international archery training center is being created in Arta , Djibouti to support archery development in East Africa and Red Sea area .
===Cuisine===
Djiboutian cuisine is a mixture of Somali cuisine , Afar people , Yemeni cuisine , and French cuisine , with some additional South Asian cuisine ( especially Indian cuisine ) culinary influences . Local dishes are commonly prepared using a lot of Middle Eastern spices , ranging from saffron to cinnamon . Grilled Yemeni fish , opened in half and often cooked in tandoori style ovens , are a local delicacy . Spicy dishes come in many variations , from the traditional Fah-fah or `` Soupe Djiboutienne '' ( spicy boiled beef soup ) , to the ( spicy mixed vegetable stew ) .

Togo ( ) , officially the Togolese Republic ( Rpublique togolaise ) , is a country in West Africa bordered by Ghana to GhanaTogo border , Benin to BeninTogo border and Burkina Faso to Burkina FasoTogo border . The country extends south to the Gulf of Guinea , where its capital city Lom is located . Togo covers , making it one of the smallest countries in Africa , with a population of approximately 8 million , as well as one of the narrowest countries in the world with a width of less than between Ghana and its slightly larger eastern neighbor , Benin .
From the 11th to the 16th century , various tribes entered the region from all directions . From the 16th century to the 18th century , the coastal region was a major trading center for Europeans to purchase slaves , earning Togo and the surrounding region the name `` The Slave Coast of West Africa '' . In 1884 , German Empire declared a region including present-day Togo as a protectorate called Togoland . After World War I , rule over Togo was transferred to France . Togo gained its independence from France in 1960 . In 1967 , Gnassingb Eyadma led a successful military coup d'tat after which he became president of an anti-communist , single-party state . Eventually , in 1993 , Eyadma faced multiparty elections , which were marred by irregularities , and he won the presidency three times .

== History ==
=== Before colonization ( pre-1884 ) ===
Archaeological finds indicate that ancient tribes were able to produce pottery and process iron . The name Togo is translated from the Ewe language as `` behind the river '' . Not much is known of the period before arrival of the Portuguese people in 1490 . During the period from the 11th century to the 16th century , various tribes entered the region from all directions : the Ewe people from the west , and the Gen language and Fon language from the east . Most of them settled in coastal areas .
The slave trade began in the 16th century , and for the next two hundred years the coastal region was a major trading centre for Europeans in search of slaves , earning Togo and the surrounding region the name `` The Slave Coast of West Africa '' .
=== Colonial era ( 18841960 ) ===
In 1884 , a paper was signed at Togoville with the King Mlapa III , whereby Germany claimed a protectorate over a stretch of territory along the coast and gradually extended its control inland . Its borders were defined after the capture of hinterland by German forces and signing agreements with France and Britain . In 1905 , this became the German colonial empire of Togoland . The local population was forced to work , cultivate cotton , coffee and cocoa and pay high taxes . A railway and the port of Lom were built for export of agricultural products . The Germans introduced modern techniques of cultivation of Cocoa bean , coffee and cotton and developed the infrastructure .
During the First World War , Togoland was invaded by United Kingdom and France , proclaiming the Anglo-French condominium . On 7 December 1916 , the condominium collapsed and Togo was divided into British and French zones . 20 July 1922 Great Britain received the League of Nations mandate to govern the western part of Togo and France to govern the eastern part . In 1945 , the country received the right to send three representatives to the French parliament .
After World War II , these mandates became United Nations Trust Territories . The residents of British Togoland 1956 British Togoland status plebiscite to join the Gold Coast ( British colony ) as part of the new independent nation of Ghana in 1957 . French Togoland became an autonomous republic within the French Union in 1959 , while France retained the right to control the defense , foreign relations and finances .
=== Independence to present day ( 1960present ) ===
The Togolese Republic was proclaimed on 27 April 1960 . In the Togolese general election , 1961 in 1961 , Sylvanus Olympio became the first president , gaining 100 % of the vote in elections boycotted by the opposition . On 9 April 1961 , the Constitution of the Togolese Republic was adopted , according to which the supreme legislative body was the National Assembly of Togo .
In December 1961 , leaders of opposition parties were arrested because they were accused of the preparation of an anti-government conspiracy . A decree was issued on the dissolution of the opposition parties . Olympio tried to reduce dependence on France by establishing cooperation with the United States , United Kingdom , and West Germany . He also rejected efforts of French soldiers who were demobilized after the Algerian War and tried to get a position in the Togolese army . These factors eventually led to a military coup on 13 January 1963 , during which he was assassinated by a group of soldiers under the direction of Sergeant Gnassingb Eyadma . A State of emergency was declared in Togo .
The military handed over power to an interim government led by Nicolas Grunitzky . In May 1963 , Grunitzky was Togolese general election , 1963 President of the Republic . The new leadership pursued a policy of developing relations with France . His main aim was to dampen the divisions between north and south , promulgate a new constitution , and introduce a multiparty system .
Exactly four years later , on 13 January 1967 , Eyadma Gnassingb overthrew Grunitzky in a bloodless coup and assumed the presidency . He created the Rally of the Togolese People , banned activities of other political parties and introduced a one-party system in November 1969 . He was reelected in Togolese general election , 1979 and Togolese presidential election , 1986 . In 1983 , the privatization program launched and in 1991 other political parties were allowed . In 1993 , the EU froze the partnership , describing Eyadema 's re-election in Togolese presidential election , 1993 , Togolese presidential election , 1998 and Togolese presidential election , 2003 , as a seizure of power . In April 2004 , in Brussels , talks were held between the European Union and Togo on the resumption of cooperation .
Eyadma Gnassingb suddenly died on 5 February 2005 , after 38 years in power , the longest rule of any dictator in Africa . The military 's immediate installation of his son , Faure Gnassingb , as president provoked widespread international condemnation , except from France . Some democratically elected African leaders such as Abdoulaye Wade of Senegal and Olusegun Obasanjo of Nigeria supported the move , thereby creating a rift within the African Union .
Gnassingb left power and held elections , which he won two months later . The opposition declared that the election results were fraudulent . The events of 2005 led to questions regarding the government 's commitment to democracy that had been made in an attempt to normalize relations with the European Union , which cut off aid in 1993 due to questions about Togo 's human rights situation . In addition , up to 400 people were killed in the violence surrounding the presidential elections , according to the United Nations . Around 40,000 Togolese fled to neighboring countries . Gnassingb was reelected in Togolese presidential election , 2010 and Togolese presidential election , 2015.
In late 2017 , Anti-government protests in Togo , 2017 anti-government protests erupted in Togo , the biggest since those after the Togolese presidential election , 2005 . Protesters demanded the resignation of Gnassingb , who is part of a family they alleged has been in power too long . The UN condemned the resulting crackdown by Togolese security forces , and The Gambia Gambia 's foreign minister , Ousainou Darboe , had to issue a correction after saying that Gnassingb should resign .
In the February 2020 , presidential elections , Faure Gnassingb won his fourth presidential term in office as the President of Togo . According to the official result , he won with a margin of around 72 % of the vote share . This enabled him to defeat his closest challenger , the former prime minister Agbyom Kodjo who had 18 % . On May 4 , 2020 , Bitala Madjoulba , the commander of a Togolese military battalion , was found dead in his office . The day of Madjoulba 's death came right after the recently re-elected Faure Gnassingb gave his investiture . An investigation has been opened for this case and all individuals around his death are being questioned .
== Geography ==
Togo has an area equal to and is one of the smallest countries in Africa . It borders the Bight of Benin in the south ; Ghana lies to the west ; Benin to the east ; and to the north , Togo is bound by Burkina Faso . Togo lies mostly between latitudes 6th parallel north 6 and 11th parallel north 11N , and longitudes prime meridian 0 and 2nd meridian east 2E .
The coast of Togo in the Gulf of Guinea is 56 ; km ( 35 miles ) long and consists of lagoons with sandy beaches . In the north , the land is characterized by a gently rolling savanna in contrast to the center of the country , which is characterized by hills . The south of Togo is characterized by a Guinean forest-savanna mosaic which reaches to a coastal plain with extensive lagoons and marshes .
The highest mountain of the country is the Mont Agou at 986 metres ( 3235 ' ) above sea level . The longest river is the Mono River with a length of 400 ; km ( 250 miles ) . It runs from north to south .
=== Climate ===
The climate is generally tropical with average temperatures ranging from on the coast to about in the northernmost regions , with a dry climate and characteristics of a Tropical and subtropical grasslands , savannas , and shrublands . To the south , there are two seasons of rain ( the first between April and July and the second between September and November ) , even though the average rainfall is not very high .
=== Flora and fauna ===
Togo contains three terrestrial ecoregions : Eastern Guinean forests , Guinean forest-savanna mosaic , and West Sudanian savanna . The coast of Togo is characterized by marshes and mangroves . High human population growth is leading to rapid deforestation , endangering many species . The country had a 2019 Forest Landscape Integrity Index mean score of 5.88/10 , ranking it 92nd globally out of 172 countries .
At least four parks and reserves have been established : Abdoulaye Faunal Reserve , Fazao Malfakassa National Park , Fosse aux Lions National Park , Koutammouko , and Kran National Park . The most frequently observed animals are giraffes , cape buffalo , [ and lions ] . Few elephants remain . Common [ [ birds are storks and Crane ( bird ) .
== Government ==
The President is elected by universal and direct suffrage for 5 years . He is also the commander of the Togolese Armed Forces and has the right to initiate legislation and dissolve parliament . Executive power is exercised by the president and the government . The head of government is the Prime Minister , who is appointed by the president .
Togo 's transition to democracy is stalled . Its democratic institutions remain nascent and fragile . President Gnassingb Eyadma , who ruled Togo under a one-party system , died of a heart attack on 5 February 2005 . Gravely ill , he was being transported by plane to a foreign country for care . He died in transit while over Tunisia . Under the Togolese Constitution , the President of the Parliament , Fambar Ouattara Natchaba , should have become President of the country , pending a new presidential election to be called within sixty days . Natchaba was out of the country , returning on an Air France plane from Paris .
The Togolese army , known as Forces Armes Togolaises ( FAT ) , or Togolese Armed Forces , closed the nation 's borders , forcing the plane to land in nearby Benin . With an engineered power vacuum , the Parliament voted to remove the constitutional clause that would have required an election within sixty days , and declared that Eyadema 's son , Faure Gnassingb , would inherit the presidency and hold office for the rest of his father 's term . Faure was sworn in on 7 February 2005 , despite international criticism of the succession .
The African Union described the takeover as a military coup d'tat . International pressure came also from the United Nations . Within Togo , opposition to the takeover culminated in riots in which several hundred died . There were uprisings in many cities and towns , mainly located in the southern part of the country . In the town of Anho reports of a general civilian uprising followed by a large scale massacre by government troops went largely unreported . In response , Faure Gnassingb agreed to hold Togo presidential election , 2005 and on 25 February , Gnassingb resigned as president , but soon afterward accepted the nomination to run for the office in April .
On 24 April 2005 , Gnassingb was elected President of Togo , receiving over 60 % of the vote according to official results . His main rival in the race had been Emmanuel Bob-Akitani from the Union des Forces du Changement ( UFC ) or Union of Forces for Change . However , electoral fraud was suspected , due to a lack of European Union or other independent oversight . Parliament designated Deputy President , Bonfoh Abbass , as interim president until the inauguration . On 3 May 2005 , Faure Gnassingb was sworn in as the new president and the European Union suspended aid to Togo in support of the opposition claims , unlike the African Union and the United States which declared the vote `` reasonably fair . '' The Nigerian president and Chair of the AU , Olusgun basanj , sought to negotiate between the incumbent government and the opposition to establish a coalition government , but rejected an AU Commission appointment of former Zambian president , Kenneth Kaunda , as special AU envoy to Togo . In June , President Gnassingb named opposition leader Edem Kodjo as the prime minister .
In October 2007 , after several postponements , elections were held under proportional representation . This allowed the less populated north to seat as many MPs as the more populated south . The president-backed party Rally of the Togolese People ( RPT ) won outright majority with the UFC coming second and the other parties claiming inconsequential representation . Again vote rigging accusations were leveled at the RPT supported by the civil and military security apparatus . Despite the presence of an EU observer mission , canceled ballots and illegal voting took place , the majority of which in RPT strongholds . The election was declared fair by the international community and praised as a model with little intimidation and few violent acts for the first time since a multiparty system was reinstated . On 3 December 2007 Komlan Mally of the RPT was appointed to prime minister succeeding Agboyibor . However , on 5 September 2008 , after only 10 months in office , Mally resigned as prime minister of Togo .
Faure Gnassingb won re-election in the March 2010 presidential election , taking 61 % of the vote against Jean-Pierre Fabre from the UFC , who had been backed by an opposition coalition called FRAC ( Republican Front for Change ) . Though the March 2010 election was largely peaceful , electoral observers noted `` procedural errors '' and technical problems , and the opposition did not recognize the results , claiming irregularities had affected the outcome . Periodic protests against Faure Gnassingb followed the election . In May 2010 , long-time opposition leader Gilchrist Olympio announced that he would enter into a power-sharing deal with the government , a coalition arrangement which provides the UFC with eight ministerial posts . In June 2012 , electoral reforms prompted protesters to take to the street in Lom for several days ; protesters sought a return to the 1992 constitution that would re-establish presidential term limits . July 2012 , saw the surprise resignation of the prime minister , Gilbert Houngbo . Days later , the commerce minister , Kwesi Ahoomey-Zunu , was named to lead the new government . In the same month , the home of opposition leader Jean Pierre Fabre was raided by security forces , and thousands of protesters again rallied publicly against the government crackdown .

== Economy ==
Togo is among the smallest countries in Africa , but possesses valuable phosphate deposits and a well-developed export sector based on agricultural products such as coffee ; cocoa bean ; and peanuts ( groundnuts ) , which together generate roughly 30 % of export earnings . Cotton is the most important cash crop . The fertile land occupies 11.3 % of the country , most of which is developed . Major crops are cassava , jasmine rice , maize and millet . Other important sectors are brewery and the textile industry . A permanent problem is the lack of electricity , because the country is able to produce only about a third of its consumption , the rest is covered by imports from Ghana and Nigeria . Low market prices for Togo 's major export commodities , however , coupled with the volatile political situation of the 1990s and early 2000s , had a negative effect on the economy .
Togo is one of the Least developed country ; the economic situation is still precarious . Togo serves as a regional commercial and trade center . The government 's decade-long efforts , supported by the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund ( IMF ) , to carry out economic reforms , to encourage investment , and to create the balance between income and consumption has stalled . Political unrest , including private and public sector strikes throughout 1992 and 1993 , jeopardized the reform program , shrank the tax base , and disrupted vital economic activity .
Togo imports machinery , equipment , petroleum products , and food . Main import partners are France ( 21.1 % ) , the Netherlands ( 12.1 % ) , Cte d'Ivoire ( 5.9 % ) , Germany ( 4.6 % ) , Italy ( 4.4 % ) , South Africa ( 4.3 % ) and China ( 4.1 % ) . The main exports are Cocoa bean , coffee , re-export of goods , phosphates and cotton . Major export partners are Burkina Faso ( 16.6 % ) , China ( 15.4 % ) , the Netherlands ( 13 % ) , Benin ( 9.6 % ) and Mali ( 7.4 % ) .
In terms of structural reforms , Togo has made progress in the liberalization of the economy , namely in the fields of trade and port activities . However , the privatization program of the cotton sector , telecommunications and water supply has stalled . The country currently has no debt due to financial assistance from the outside while Togo is likely among the most beneficiary countries under the Initiative help in Heavily Indebted Poor Countries .
12 January 1994 devaluation of the currency by 50 % provided an important impetus to renewed structural adjustment ; these efforts were facilitated by the end of strife in 1994 and a return to overt political calm . Progress depends on increased openness in government financial operations ( to accommodate increased social service outlays ) and possible downsizing of the armed forces , on which the regime has depended to stay in place . Lack of aid , along with depressed cocoa prices , generated a 1 % fall in GDP in 1998 , with growth resuming in 1999 . Togo is a member of the Organization for the Harmonization of Business Law in Africa ( OHADA ) .
=== Agriculture ===
Agriculture is the backbone of the economy , although it is struggling with a chronic shortage of funds for the purchase of irrigation equipment and fertilizers , which has significantly reduced agricultural output . Agriculture generated 28.2 % of GDP in 2012 and employed 49 % of the working population in 2010 . The country is essentially self-sufficient in food production . Livestock production is dominated by cattle breeding .
=== Mining ===
Mining generated about 33.9 % of GDP in 2012 and employed 12 % of the population in 2010 . Togo has the fourth largest phosphate deposits in the world . Their production is 2.1 million tons per year . Since the mid-90s , however , there has been a decline in the mining industry and government will need to invest heavily to sustain it . The mining industry is facing difficulties due to falling phosphate prices on world markets and increasing foreign competition . There are also reserves of limestone , marble and salt .
Industry provides only 20.4 % of Togo 's national income , because it consists only of a few light industries and builders . Large reserves of limestone allows Togo to produce cement .

The remaining 5 % were reported to include persons not affiliated with any religious group . The report also noted that many Christians and Muslims continue to perform indigenous religious practices .
The CIA World Factbook meanwhile states that 44 % of the population are Christian , 14 % are Muslim with 36 % being followers of indigenous beliefs .
Christianity began to spread from the middle of the 15th century , after the arrival of the Portuguese and Roman Catholic missionaries . Germans introduced Protestantism in the second half of the 19th century , when a hundred missionaries of the Bremen Missionary Society were sent to the coastal areas of Togo and Ghana . Togo 's Protestants were known as `` Brema , '' a corruption of the word `` Bremen . '' After World War I , German missionaries had to leave , which gave birth to the early autonomy of the Ewe Evangelical Church .

French is used in formal education , legislature , all forms of media , Administration ( law ) and commerce . Ewe is a language of wider communication in the south . Tem language functions to a limited extent as a trade language in some northern towns . Officially , Ewe and Kabiye are `` national languages '' , which in the Togolese context means languages that are promoted in formal education and used in the media .

The Republic of the Congo ( Rpublique du Congo , Repubilika ya Kngo ) , also known as Congo-Brazzaville , the Congo Republic or simply either Congo or the Congo is a country located in the western coast of Central Africa . To the west lies Gabon ; Cameroon to its northwest and the Central African Republic to its northeast ; the Democratic Republic of the Congo to the southeast and the Angolan exclave of Cabinda Province to its south ; and the Atlantic Ocean to its southwest . The official language is French language .
The region was dominated by Bantu peoples-speaking tribes at least 3,000 years ago , who built trade links leading into the Congo River basin . Congo was formerly part of the French colonial empire of French Equatorial Africa . The Republic of the Congo was established on 28 November 1958 and gained independence from France in 1960 . It was a MarxistLeninist state from 1969 to 1992 , under the name People 's Republic of the Congo . The sovereign state has had multi-party elections since 1992 , although a democratically elected government was ousted in the 1997 Republic of the Congo Civil War ( 199799 ) , and President Denis Sassou Nguesso , who first came to power in 1979 , has ruled for 35 of the past 40 years .
The Republic of the Congo is a member of the African Union , the United Nations , La Francophonie , the Economic Community of Central African States , and the Non-Aligned Movement . It has become the fourth-largest oil producer in the Gulf of Guinea , providing the country with a degree of prosperity despite political and economic instability in some areas and unequal distribution of oil revenue nationwide . Economy of the Republic of the Congo Congo 's economy is heavily dependent on the oil sector , and economic growth has slowed considerably since 2010s oil glut the post-2015 drop in oil prices . With a population of 5.2 million , 88.5 % of the country practices religion in the Republic of the Congo .
==Etymology==
The country  s name means `` [ Land beside ] the Congo River '' , adopted by the country upon independence in 1960 from the previous Fifth French Republic autonomous colony Republic of the Congo ( Rpublique du Congo ) established in 1958 , ultimately from the name of the original Third French Republic list of French colonies French Congo ( Congo franais ) established in 1882 . The river itself derived its name from Kingdom of Kongo , a Bantu peoples kingdom which occupied its mouth around the time of its discovery by the Kingdom of Portugal in 1483 or 1484 and whose name derived from its people , the Bakongo , an endonym said to mean `` hunters '' ( mukongo , nkongo ) .
Other names are sometimes known to as the French Congo , Middle Congo and Congo ( Brazzaville ) with the latter inclusion of the country 's capital to distinguish it from Democratic Republic of the Congo Congo ( Lopoldville ) or ( Kinshasa ) to its south . Brazzaville itself derives from the colony 's founder , Pierre Savorgnan de Brazza , an Italian nobleman whose title referred to the town of Brazzacco , in the comune of Moruzzo , whose name derived from the Latin language Brattius or Braccius , both meaning `` arm '' .
==History==
===Pre-colonial===
Bantu peoples Bantu-speaking peoples who founded tribes during the Bantu expansions largely displaced and absorbed the earliest inhabitants of the region , the African Pygmies people , about 1500BC . The Bakongo , a Bantu ethnic group that also occupied parts of present-day Angola , Gabon , and the Democratic Republic of the Congo , formed the basis for ethnic affinities and rivalries among those countries . Several Bantu kingdomsnotably those of the Kongo Empire , the Kingdom of Loango , and the Kingdom of Anzikubuilt trade links leading into the Congo River basin .
The Kingdom of Portugal explorer Diogo Co reached the mouth of the Congo in 1484 . Commercial relationships quickly grew between the inland Bantu kingdoms and European merchants who traded in various commodities , manufactured goods , and also people captured and enslaved in the [ After centuries as a major hub for transatlantic trade , direct European colonization of the Congo river delta began in the late 19th century , subsequently eroding the power of the Bantu societies in the region .
===French colonial era===
The area north of the Congo River came under French sovereignty in 1880 as a result of Pierre de Brazza ] 's treaty with King Makoko of the [ [ Bateke . After the death of Makoko , his widow Queen Ngalifourou upheld the terms of the treaty and became an important ally to the colonisers . This Congo Colony became known first as French Congo , then as Middle Congo in 1903.
In 1908 , France organized French Equatorial Africa ( AEF ) , comprising the Middle Congo , French Gabon , French Chad , and Oubangui-Chari ( the modern Central African Republic ) . The French designated Brazzaville as the federal capital . Economic development during the first 50 years of colonial rule in Congo centered on natural-resource extraction . The methods were often brutal : construction of the Congo-Ocean Railway following World War I has been estimated to have cost at least 14,000 lives .
During the Nazi occupation of France during World War II , Brazzaville functioned as the symbolic capital of Free France between 1940 and 1943 . The Brazzaville Conference of 1944 heralded a period of major reform in French colonial policy . Congo benefited from the postwar expansion of colonial administrative and infrastructure spending as a result of its central geographic location within AEF and the federal capital at Brazzaville . It also had a local legislature after the adoption of the 1946 constitution that established the French Fourth Republic .
Following the revision of the Constitution of France that established the French Fifth Republic in 1958 , the AEF dissolved into its constituent parts , each of which became an autonomous colony within the French Community . During these reforms , Middle Congo became known as the Republic of the Congo in 1958 and published its first constitution in 1959 . Antagonism between the Mbochis ( who favored Jacques Opangault ) and the Lari people ( Congo ) s and Kongo peoples ( who favored Fulbert Youlou , the first black mayor elected in French Equatorial Africa ) resulted in a series of riots in Brazzaville in February 1959 , which the French Army subdued .
New elections took place in April 1959 . By the time the Congo became independent in August 1960 , Opangault , the former opponent of Youlou , agreed to serve under him . Youlou became the first President of the Republic of the Congo . Since the political tension was so high in Pointe-Noire , Youlou moved the capital to Brazzaville .
===Post-independence era===
The Republic of the Congo became fully independent from France on 15 August 1960 . Youlou ruled as the country 's first president until labour elements and rival political parties instigated a Trois Glorieuses ( 1963 ) three-day uprising that ousted him . The Congolese military briefly took over the country , and installed a civilian provisional government headed by Alphonse Massamba-Dbat .
Under the 1963 constitution , Massamba-Dbat was elected President for a five-year term . During Alphonse Massamba-Dbat # Congo under Massamba-Dbat ( 1963-1968 ) Massamba-Dbat 's term in office the regime adopted `` scientific socialism '' as the country 's constitutional ideology . In 1965 , Congo established relations with the Soviet Union , the China People 's Republic of China , North Korea and North Vietnam . On the night of February 14 to 15 , 1965 , three prominent public officials of the Republic of the Congo were kidnapped : Lazare Matsocota ( prosecutor of the Republic ) , Joseph Pouabou ( president of the Supreme Court ) and Massoum Anselme ( director of the Congolese Information Agency ) . The bodies of two of these men were later found , mutilated , by the Congo River . Massamba-Dbat 's regime also invited several hundred Cuban army troops into the country to train his party 's militia units and these troops helped his government survive a 1966 Republic of the Congo coup d'tat attempt coup d'tat in 1966 led by paratroopers loyal to future President Marien Ngouabi . Nevertheless , Massamba-Dbat was unable to reconcile various institutional , tribal and ideological factions within the country and his regime ended abruptly with a bloodless 1968 Republic of the Congo coup d'tat .
Marie Ngouabi , who had participated in the coup , assumed the presidency on 31 December 1968 . One year later , Ngouabi proclaimed the Congo Africa 's first `` people 's republic '' , the People 's Republic of the Congo , and announced the decision of the National Revolutionary Movement to change its name to the Congolese Party of Labour ( PCT ) . He survived an 1972 Republic of the Congo coup d'tat attempt but was assassinated on 16 March1977 . An 11-member Military Committee of the Party ( CMP ) was then named to head an interim government , with Joachim Yhombi-Opango serving as president . Two years later , Yhombi-Opango was forced from power and Denis Sassou Nguesso become the new president .
Sassou Nguesso aligned the country with the Eastern Bloc and signed a twenty-year friendship pact with the Soviet Union . Over the years , Sassou had to rely more on political repression and less on patronage to maintain his dictatorship .
Pascal Lissouba , who became Congo 's first elected president ( 19921997 ) during the period of multi-party democracy , attempted to implement economic reforms with IMF backing to liberalize the economy . In June 1996 , the IMF approved a three-year Special drawing rights69.5m ( US $ 100m ) enhanced structural adjustment facility ( ESAF ) and was on the verge of announcing a renewed annual agreement when civil war broke out in Congo in mid-1997 .
Congo 's democratic progress was derailed in 1997 , when Lissouba and Sassou started to fight for power in the Republic of the Congo Civil War ( 1997-99 ) . As presidential elections scheduled for July 1997 approached , tensions between the Lissouba and Sassou camps mounted . On 5 June , President Lissouba 's government forces surrounded Sassou 's compound in Brazzaville and Sassou ordered members of his private militia ( known as `` Cobras '' ) to resist . Thus began a four-month conflict that destroyed or damaged much of Brazzaville and caused tens of thousands of civilian deaths . In early October , the Angolan government began an invasion of Congo to install Sassou in power . In mid-October , the Lissouba government fell . Soon thereafter , Sassou declared himself president .
In the controversial Republic of the Congo presidential election , 2002 , Sassou won with almost 90 % of the vote cast . His two main rivals , Lissouba and Bernard Kolelas , were prevented from competing and the only remaining credible rival , Andr Milongo , advised his supporters to boycott the elections and then withdrew from the race . A new constitution , agreed upon by Republic of the Congo constitutional referendum , 2002 , granted the president new powers , extended his term to seven years , and introduced a new bicameral assembly . International observers took issue with the organization of the presidential election and the constitutional referendum , both of which were reminiscent in their organization of Congo 's era of the one-party state . Following the presidential elections , fighting restarted in the Pool Department between government forces and rebels led by Pastor Ntumi ; a peace treaty to end the conflict was signed in April 2003.
Sassou also won the following Republic of the Congo presidential election , 2009 . According to the Congolese Observatory of Human Rights , a non-governmental organization , the election was marked by `` very low '' turnout and `` fraud and irregularities '' . In March 2015 Sassou announced that he wanted to run for yet another term in office and a Republic of the Congo constitutional referendum , 2015 in October resulted in a changed constitution which allowed him to run during the Republic of the Congo presidential election , 2016 . He won the election believed by many to be fraudulent . After violent protests in the capital , Sassou attacked the Pool region , where the Ninja ( militia ) s of the civil war used to be based , in what was believed to be a distraction . This led to a revival of the Ninja rebels who launched attacks against the army in April 2016 , leading 80,000 people to flee their homes . A ceasefire deal was signed in December 2017.
==Government ==
Congo-Brazzaville has had a multi-party system multi-party political system since the early 1990s , although the system is heavily dominated by President Denis Sassou Nguesso ; he has lacked serious competition in the presidential elections held under his rule . Sassou Nguesso is backed by his own Congolese Labour Party ( Parti Congolais du Travail ) as well as a range of smaller parties .
Sassou 's regime has seen many Political corruption revelations despite attempts to censor them . One French investigation found over 110 bank accounts and dozens of lavish properties in France . Sassou denounced embezzlement investigations as `` racist '' and `` colonial '' . Denis Christel Sassou-Nguesso , son of Denis Sassou Nguesso , has been named in association with the Panama Papers .
On 27 March 2015 , Sassou Nguesso announced that his government would hold a referendum on changing the country 's 2002 constitution to allow him to run for a third consecutive term in office . On 25 October the government held a referendum on allowing Sassou Nguesso to run in the next election . The government claimed that the proposal was approved by 92 % of voters , with 72 % of eligible voters participating . The opposition , who boycotted the referendum , said that the government 's statistics were false and the vote was a fake one .
The election raised questions and was accompanied by civil unrest and police shootings of protesters ; at least 18 people were killed by security forces during opposition rallies leading up to the referendum held in October .
===Media===
In 2008 , the primary media were owned by the government , but privately run forms of media were being created . There is one government-owned television station and around 10 small private television channels .
===Human rights===
Many Pygmies belong from birth to Bantu peopless in a relationship many refer to as slavery . The Congolese Human Rights Observatory says that the Pygmies are treated as property in the same way as pets . On 30 December2010 , the Parliament of the Republic of the Congo adopted a law for to promote and protect the rights of indigenous peoples . This law is the first of its kind in Africa , and its adoption is a historic development for indigenous peoples on the continent .
===Administrative divisions===
The Republic of the Congo is divided into 12 Departments of the Republic of the Congo ( departments ) . Departments are divided into communes and districts .
These are :
==Geography and climate==
Congo is located in the central-western part of sub-Saharan Africa , along the Equator , lying between latitudes 4th parallel north 4N and 5th parallel south 5S , and longitudes 11th meridian east 11 and 19th meridian east 19E . To the south and east of it is the Democratic Republic of the Congo . It is also bounded by Gabon to the west , Cameroon and the Central African Republic to the north , and Cabinda ( province ) ( Angola ) to the southwest . It has a short coast on the Atlantic Ocean .
The capital , Brazzaville , is located on the Congo River , in the south of the country , immediately across from Kinshasa , the capital of the Democratic Republic of the Congo .
The southwest of the country is a coastal plain for which the primary drainage is the Kouilou-Niari River ; the interior of the country consists of a central plateau between two basins to the south and north . Forests are under increasing exploitation pressure . Congo had a 2018 Forest Landscape Integrity Index mean score of 8.89/10 , ranking it 12th globally out of 172 countries .
Congo lies within four terrestrial ecoregions : Atlantic Equatorial coastal forests , Northwestern Congolian lowland forests , Western Congolian swamp forests , and Western Congolian forest-savanna mosaic . Since the country is located on the Equator , the climate is consistent year-round , with the average day temperature a humid and nights generally between and . The average yearly rainfall ranges from in the Niari Valley in the south to over in central parts of the country . The dry season is from June to August , while in the majority of the country the wet season has two rainfall maxima : one in MarchMay and another in SeptemberNovember .
In 200607 , researchers from the Wildlife Conservation Society studied gorillas in heavily forested regions centered on the Ouesso district of the Sangha Region . They suggest a population on the order of 125,000 western lowland gorillas , whose isolation from humans has been largely preserved by inhospitable swamps .
==Economy==
The economy is a mixture of village agriculture and handicrafts , an industrial sector based largely on petroleum , support services , and a government characterized by budget problems and overstaffing . Petroleum extraction has supplanted forestry as the mainstay of the economy . In 2008 , the oil sector accounted for 65 % of the GDP , 85 % of government revenue , and 92 % of exports . The country also has large untapped Mining in the Republic of the Congo wealth .
In the early 1980s , rapidly rising oil revenues enabled the government to finance large-scale development projects . GDP grew an average 5 % annually , one of the highest rates in Africa . The government has mortgaged a substantial portion of its petroleum earnings , contributing to a shortage of revenues . On 12 January1994 devaluation of CFA franc currencies by 50 % resulted in inflation of 46 % in 1994 , but inflation has subsided since .
Economic reform efforts continued with the support of international organizations , notably the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund . The reform program came to a halt in June 1997 when civil war erupted . When Sassou Nguesso returned to power at the end of the war in October 1997 , he publicly expressed interest in moving forward on economic reforms and privatization and in renewing cooperation with international financial institutions . However , economic progress was badly hurt by slumping oil prices and the resumption of armed conflict in December 1998 , which worsened the republic 's budget deficit .
The current administration presides over an uneasy internal peace and faces difficult economic problems of stimulating recovery and reducing poverty , despite record-high oil prices since 2003 . Natural gas and diamonds are also recent major Congolese exports , although Congo was excluded from the Kimberley Process in 2004 amid allegations that most of its diamond exports were in fact being smuggled out of the neighboring Democratic Republic of the Congo ; it was re-admitted to the group in 2007.
The Republic of the Congo also has large untapped base metal , gold , iron and phosphate deposits . The country is a member of the Organization for the Harmonization of Business Law in Africa ( OHADA ) . The Congolese government signed an agreement in 2009 to lease 200,000 hectares of land to South African farmers to reduce its dependence on imports .
The GDP of the Republic of the Congo grew by 6 % in 2014 and is expected to have grown by 7.5 % in 2015.
In 2018 , the Republic of the Congo joined the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries .
==Transportation==
Transport in the Republic of the Congo includes land , air and water transportation . The country 's CongoOcean Railway was CongoOcean Railway # History during the 1930s and largely remains in operation . There are also over 1000 ; km of paved roads and two major international airports ( Maya-Maya Airport and Agostinho-Neto International Airport Pointe-Noire Airport ) which have flights to destinations in Europe , Africa , and the Middle East . The country also has a large port on the Atlantic Ocean at Pointe-Noire and others along the Congo River at Brazzaville and Impfondo .

The Republic of the Congo 's sparse population is concentrated in the southwestern portion of the country , leaving the vast areas of tropical jungle in the north virtually uninhabited . Thus , Congo is one of the most urbanized countries in Africa , with 70 % of its total population living in a few urban areas , namely in Brazzaville , Pointe-Noire or one of the small cities or villages lining the railway which connects the two cities . In rural areas , industrial and commercial activity has declined rapidly in recent years , leaving rural economies dependent on the government for support and subsistence .
Ethnically and linguistically the population of the Republic of the Congo is diverseEthnologue recognises 62 spoken languages in the countrybut can be grouped into three categories . The Kongo people are the largest ethnic group and form roughly half of the population . The most significant subgroups of the Kongo are Lari ( ethnic group ) , in Brazzaville and Pool regions , and the Vili people , around Pointe-Noire and along the Atlantic coast . The second largest group are the Bateke , who live to the north of Brazzaville , with 17 % of the population . Mbochi ( M  Boshi ) live in the northwest and in Brazzaville and form 12 % of the population . Pygmies make up 2 % of Congo 's population .
Before the 1997 war , about 9,000 Europeans and other non-Africans lived in Congo , most of whom were French people ; only a fraction of this number remains . Around 300 United States expatriates reside in the Congo .
According to CIA World Factbook , the people of the Republic of the Congo are largely a mix of Catholics ( 33.1 % ) , Awakening ( religious movement ) ( 22.3 % ) and other Protestants ( 19.9 % ) . Followers of Islam make up 1.6 % ; this is primarily due to an influx of foreign workers into the urban centers .
According to a 201112 survey , total fertility rate was 5.1 children born per woman , with 4.5 in urban areas and 6.5 in rural areas .
===Health===
Public expenditure health was at 8.9 % of the GDP in 2004 , whereas private expenditure was at 1.3 % .
, the HIV/AIDS prevalence was at 2.8 % among 15- to 49-year-olds . Health expenditure was at US $ 30 per capita in 2004 . A large proportion of the population is undernourished , and malnutrition a problem in Congo-Brazzaville . There were 20 physicians per 100,000 persons in the early 2000s ( decade ) .
, the maternal mortality rate was 560 deaths/100,000 live births , and the infant mortality rate was 59.34 deaths/1,000 live births . Female genital mutilation ( FGM ) is rare in the country , being confined to limited geographic areas of the country .
==Cultural heritage==
The Republic of the Congo has a wide variety of natural landscapes , ranging from the savanna plains in the North Niari flooded forests , to the vast Congo River , to rugged mountains and forest of Mayombe , and including 170 ; km of beaches along the Atlantic coast . The numerous ethnic groups , forms of art , and political structures express a rich cultural diversity and
Among the best known are Kingdom of Loango # Name nail fetishes , Bembe people statuettes that are full of expression ; the masks of the Punu people and Kwele people , Kota people ( Gabon ) reliquaries , Teke people fetishes , and cemeteries with monumental tombs are examples of this variety . The Lari people ( Congo ) people also have unique artifacts .
The Republic of the Congo also has considerable colonial architectural heritage , which it is preserving . Restoration of architectural works is underway in Brazzaville , for example at the Basilica of Sainte-Anne du Congo , which was completed in 2011.
Because of problems with the communications network , the country is not ready to build on [ tourism ] . It is working to improve the network that supports its hotels and related tourism facilities in Pointe Noire and Brazzaville . Many sites are difficult to reach in overland visits . Some of the South 's most populous and developed locations are often the least accessible . For example , the massive Chaillu Mountains are almost impossible to visit .
===Arts===
Congolese singers have become known internationally : the Franco-Congolese rapper Passi 's work is broadcast in France , and he has released several hit albums , such as Temptations , with the famous song `` I zap and I mate . '' Other notable musicians include , singer of the former group ; rappers Calbo ( rapper ) of rsenik , of , Mystic , RCFA , the group Bisso Na Bisso and .
Several writers from the Republic of Congo have become recognised elsewhere in Africa and the French-speaking world , including Alain Mabanckou , Jean-Baptiste Tati Loutard , Jeannette Balou Tchichelle , Henri Lopes , Lassy Mbouity , and Tchicaya U Tam'si .
Artists have struggled to build a film industry . After a promising start in the 1970s , the troubled political situation closed cinemas and made film production difficult . Instead of making feature films for distribution to theaters , filmmakers generally directly stream their video productions on the internet .
Congolese culture , art , and media have suffered from a lack of investment due to the unstable political conditions and warfare .
===Education===
Public expenditure of the GDP was less in 200205 than in 1991 . Public education is theoretically free and mandatory for under-16-year-olds but , in practice , expenses exist . In 2005 net primary enrollment rate was 44 % , a significant drop from the 79 % in 1991 . Education between ages six and sixteen is compulsory . Pupils who complete six years of primary school and seven years of secondary school obtain a baccalaureate .
The country has universities where students can obtain a bachelor 's degree in three years and a master 's in five . Marien Ngouabi Universitywhich offers courses in medicine , law , and other fieldsis the country 's only public university .
Instruction at all levels is in French language , and the educational system as a whole models the French system .

The Marshall Islands , officially the Republic of the Marshall Islands ( Aolepn Aorkin aje ) , is an island country and an associated state of the United States near the Equator in the Pacific Ocean , slightly west of the International Date Line . Geographically , the country is part of the larger island group of Micronesia . The country 's population of 58,413 people ( at the 2018 World Bank Census ) is spread out over 29 coral atolls , comprising 1,156 individual islands and islets . The capital city and largest city is Majuro . It has the largest portion of its territory made of water of any sovereign state , at 97.87 % .
The islands share Maritime boundary with Wake Island to the north , Kiribati to the southeast , Nauru to the south , and Federated States of Micronesia to the west . About 52.3 % of Marshall Islanders ( 27,797 at the 2011 Census ) live on Majuro . Data from the United Nations indicates an estimated population in of . In 2016 , 73.3 % of the population were defined as being `` urban '' . The UN also indicates a population density of 295 per km2 ( 765 people per mi2 ) and its projected 2020 population is 59,190.
Micronesian colonists reached the Marshall Islands using canoes circa 2nd millennium BC , with interisland navigation made possible using Marshall Islands stick charts . They eventually settled here . Islands in the archipelago were first explored by Ethnic groups in Europe in the 1520s , starting with Ferdinand Magellan , a Portuguese explorer in the service of Spain , Juan Sebastin Elcano and Miguel de Saavedra . Spanish explorer Alonso de Salazar reported sighting an atoll in August 1526 . Other expeditions by Spanish and English ships followed . The islands derive their name from John Marshall ( British captain ) , who visited in 1788 . The islands were historically known by the inhabitants as `` jolet jen Anij '' ( Gifts from God ) .
Spain claimed the islands in 1592 , and the European powers recognized its sovereignty over the islands in 1874 . They had been part of the Spanish East Indies formally since 1528 . Later , Spain sold some of the islands to the German Empire in 1885 , and they became part of German New Guinea that year , run by the trading companies doing business in the islands , particularly the Jaluit Company . In World War I , the Empire of Japan occupied the Marshall Islands , which , in 1920 , the League of Nations combined with other former German territories to form the South Seas Mandate . During World War II , the United States took control of the islands in the Gilbert and Marshall Islands campaign in 1944 . Nuclear testing began on Bikini Atoll in 1946 and concluded in 1958.
The US government formed the Congress of Micronesia in 1965 , a plan for increased self-governance of Pacific islands . The Trust Territory of the Pacific Islands in May 1979 provided independence to the Marshall Islands , whose constitution and president ( Amata Kabua ) were formally recognized by the US . Full sovereignty or self-government was achieved in a Compact of Free Association with the United States . Marshall Islands has been a member of the Pacific Community ( SPC ) since 1983 and a United Nations member state since 1991 . Politically , the Marshall Islands is a parliamentary republic with an executive presidency in Associated state with the United States , with the US providing defense , subsidies , and access to U.S.-based agencies such as the Federal Communications Commission and the United States Postal Service . With few natural resources , the islands ' wealth is based on a service economy , as well as some fishing and agriculture ; aid from the United States represents a large percentage of the islands ' gross domestic product . The country uses the United States dollar as its currency . In 2018 , it also announced plans for a new cryptocurrency to be used as legal tender .
The majority of the citizens of the Republic of Marshall Islands , formed in 1982 , are of Marshallese descent , though there are small numbers of immigrants from the United States , China , Philippines , and other Pacific islands . The two official languages are Marshallese language , which is one of the Oceanic languages , and English language . Almost the entire population of the islands practices some religion : three-quarters of the country follows either the United Church of Christ  Congregational in the Marshall Islands ( UCCCMI ) or the Assemblies of God .
== History ==
Evidence suggests that around 3,000 years ago successive waves of human migrants from Southeast Asia spread across the Western Pacific Ocean , populating its many small islands . The Marshall Islands were settled by Micronesians in the 2nd millennium BC . Little is known of the islands ' early history . Early settlers traveled between the islands by canoe using traditional stick charts .
The Spain explorer Alonso de Salazar landed there in 1526 , and the archipelago came to be known as `` Los Pintados '' ( `` The Painted ( Ones ) '' , possibly referring to the Indigenous peoples people first found there ) , `` Las Hermanas '' ( `` The Sisters '' ) and `` Los Jardines '' ( `` The Gardens '' ) within the Spanish Empire . It first fell within the jurisdiction of the New Spain , and was then administered by Madrid , through the Captaincy General of the Philippines , upon the Latin American wars of independence and the dissolution of New Spain starting in 1821.
American whaling ships visited the islands in the 19th century . The first on record was the Awashonks in 1835 and last was the Andrews Hicks in 1905.
The islands were only formally possessed by Spain for much of their colonial history , and on European maps were grouped with the Caroline Islands which today make up Palau and the Federated States of Micronesia , or alternatively the `` Nuevas Filipinas '' ( `` New Philippines '' ) . The islands were mostly left to their own affairs except for short-lived religious missions ( documented in 1668 and 1731 ) during the 16th and 17th centuries . They were largely ignored by European powers except for cartographic demarcation treaties between the Iberian Empires ( Portugal and Castilian Spain ) in 1529 , 1750 and 1777 . The archipelago corresponding to the present-day country was independently named by Adam Johann von Krusenstern , after Kingdom of Great Britain explorer John Marshall ( British captain ) , who visited them together with Thomas Gilbert ( captain ) in 1788 , en route from Botany Bay to Guangzhou with two ships of the First Fleet , and started to establish German and British trading posts , which were not formally contested by Spain .
The Marshall Islands were formally claimed by Spanish Empire in 1874 through its capital in the East Indies , Manila . This marked the start of several strategic moves by the German Empire during the 1870s and 80s to annex them ( claiming them to be `` by chance unoccupied '' ) . This policy culminated in a tense naval episode in 1885 , which did not degenerate into a conflict due to the poor readiness of Spain 's naval forces and the unwillingness for open military action from the German side .
Following papal mediation and German compensation of $ 4.5 million , Spain reached an agreement with German Empire in 1885 : the 1885 Hispano-German Protocol of Rome . This accord established a protectorate and set up trading stations on the islands of Jaluit ( Jol ) and Ebon Atoll to carry out the flourishing copra ( dried coconut meat ) trade . Marshallese Iroij ( high chiefs ) continued to rule under indirect colonial German administration , rendered tacitly effective by the wording in the 1885 Protocol , which demarcated an area subject to Spanish sovereignty ( 0-11N , 133-164E ) omitting the Eastern Carolines , that is , the Marshall and Gilbert archipelagos , where most of the German trading posts were located . The disputes were rendered moot after the selling of the whole Caroline archipelago to Germany 13 years later .
At the beginning of World War I , Japan assumed control of the Marshall Islands . The Japanese headquarters was established at the German center of administration , Jaluit . On January 31 , 1944 American forces landed on Kwajalein atoll and U.S. Marines and Army troops later took control of the islands from the Japanese on February 3 , following intense fighting on Kwajalein and Enewetak Atoll atolls . In 1947 , the United States , as the occupying power , entered into an agreement with the UN Security Council to administer much of Micronesia , including the Marshall Islands , as the Trust Territory of the Pacific Islands .
From 1946 to 1958 , it served as the Pacific Proving Grounds for the United States and was the site of 67 nuclear tests on various atolls . The world 's first [ bomb ] , codenamed `` Ivy Mike '' , was tested at the Enewetak atoll in the Marshall Islands on November 1 ( local date ) in 1952 , by the United States .
Nuclear testing began in 1946 on Bikini Atoll after residents were evacuated . Over the years , 67 weapon tests were conducted , including the 15-megaton Castle Bravo hydrogen bomb test , which produced significant fallout in the region . The testing concluded in 1958 . Over the years , just one of over 60 islands was cleaned by the US government , and the inhabitants are still waiting for the 2 billion dollars in compensation assessed by the Nuclear Claims Tribunal . Many of the islanders and their descendants still live in exile , as the islands remain contaminated with high levels of radiation .
A significant radar installation was constructed on Kwajalein atoll .
On May 1 , 1979 , in recognition of the evolving political status of the Marshall Islands , the United States recognized the constitution of the Marshall Islands and the establishment of the Government of the Republic of the Marshall Islands . The constitution incorporates both American and British constitutional concepts .
There have been a number of local and national elections since the Republic of the Marshall Islands was founded . The United Democratic Party , running on a reform platform , won the 1999 parliamentary election , taking control of the presidency and cabinet .
The islands signed a Compact of Free Association with the United States in 1986 . Trusteeship was ended under United Nations Security Council Resolution 683 of December 22 , 1990 . Until 1999 the islanders received United States dollar US $ 180M for continued American use of Kwajalein atoll , US $ 250M in compensation for nuclear testing , and US $ 600M in other payments under the compact .
Despite the constitution , the government was largely controlled by Iroij . It was not until 1999 , following political corruption allegations , that the Aristocracy ( government ) government was overthrown , with Imata Kabua replaced by the commoner Kessai Note .
The Runit Dome was built on Runit Island to deposit U.S.-produced radioactive soil and debris , including lethal amounts of plutonium . There are ongoing concerns around deterioration of the waste site and a potential radioactive contamination .
==Geography==
The Marshall Islands sit atop ancient submerged volcanoes rising from the ocean floor , about halfway between Hawaii and Australia , north of Nauru and Kiribati , east of the Federated States of Micronesia , and south of the disputed U.S. territory of Wake Island , to which it also lays claim . The atolls and islands form two groups : the Ratak Chain Ratak ( sunrise ) and the Ralik Chain Ralik ( sunset ) . The two island chains lie approximately parallel to one another , running northwest to southeast , comprising about of ocean but only about of land mass . Each includes 15 to 18 islands and atolls . The country consists of a total of 29 atolls and five individual islands situated in about of the Pacific . The largest atoll with a land area of is Kwajalein . It surrounds a lagoon .
Twenty-four of the atolls and islands are inhabited . The remaining atolls are uninhabited due to poor living conditions , lack of rain , or nuclear contamination . The uninhabited atolls are :
* Ailinginae Atoll
* Bikar Atoll Bikar ( Bikaar ) Atoll
* Bikini Atoll
* Bokak Atoll
* Erikub Atoll
* Jemo Island
* Nadikdik Atoll
* Rongerik Atoll
* Toke Atoll
* Ujelang Atoll
The average altitude above sea level for the entire country is .
===Shark sanctuary===
In October 2011 , the government declared that an area covering nearly of ocean shall be reserved as a shark sanctuary . This is the world 's largest shark sanctuary , extending the worldwide ocean area in which sharks are protected from . In protected waters , all shark fishing is banned and all bycatch by-catch must be released . However , some have questioned the ability of the Marshall Islands to enforce this zone .
===Territorial claim on Wake Island===
The Marshall Islands also lays claim to Wake Island . While Wake island has been administered by the United States since 1899 , the Marshallese government refers to it by the name Enen-kio .
===Climate===
The climate has a relatively dry season from December to April and a wet season from May to November . Many Pacific typhoons begin as tropical storms in the Marshall Islands region , and grow stronger as they move west toward the Mariana Islands and the Philippines .
Due to its very low elevation , the Marshall Islands are threatened by the potential effects of sea level rise . According to the president of Nauru , the Marshall Islands are the most endangered nation in the world due to flooding from climate change .
Population has outstripped the supply of fresh water , usually from rainfall . The northern atolls get of rainfall annually ; the southern atolls about twice that . The threat of drought is commonplace throughout the island chains .
===Fauna===
Crabs include [ crab ] s , and coconut crabs .
====Birds====
Most birds found in the Marshall Islands , with the exception of those few introduced by man , are either sea birds or a migratory species . There are about 70 species of birds , including 31 seabirds . 15 of these species actually nest locally . Sea birds include the black noddy and the white tern . The only land bird is the [ sparrow ] , introduced by humans .
====Marine====
There are about 300 species of fish , 250 of which are Coral reef fish .
* Turtles : Chelonia mydas , Eretmochelys imbricata , Leatherback sea turtles , and Olive ridley sea turtles .
* Sharks : There are at least 22 shark species including : Blue shark , Silky shark , Bigeye thresher shark , Pelagic thresher shark , Oceanic whitetip shark , and Tawny nurse shark .
====Arthropods====
* Scorpions : Liocheles australasiae , and Isometrus maculatus . Pseudoscorpions are occasionally found .
* Spiders : Two : a scytodes , Dictis striatipes ; and Jaluiticola a genus ( biology ) of Salticidae endemic to the Marshall Islands . Its only species is Jaluiticola hesslei .
* Amphipod : One - Talorchestia spinipalma .
* Orthoptera : Blattidae , American cockroaches , short-horned grasshopper , gryllidaes .
==Demographics==
Historical population figures for the Marshall Islands are unknown . In 1862 , the population of the Islands was estimated at 10,000 . In 1960 , the population of the Islands was approximately 15,000 . The 2011 Census counted 53,158 island residents . Over two-thirds of the residents of the Marshall Islands live in the capital city , Majuro , and the secondary urban center , Ebeye ( located in Kwajalein Atoll ) . This figures excludes Marshall Islands natives who have relocated elsewhere ; the Compact of Free Association allows them to freely relocate to the United States and obtain work there . Approximately 4,300 Marshall Islands natives relocated to Springdale , Arkansas in the United States ; this figure represents the largest population concentration of Marshall Islands natives outside their island home .
Most residents of the Marshall Islands are Marshallese . Marshallese people are of Micronesian origin and are believed to have migrated from Asia to the Marshall Islands several thousand years ago . A minority of Marshallese have some recent Asian ancestry ( mainly Japanese settlement in the Marshall Islands ) . About one-half of the nation 's population lives in Majuro and Ebeye .
The official languages of the Marshall Islands are English language and Marshallese language . Both languages are widely spoken .
===Religion===
Major religious groups in the Republic of the Marshall Islands include the United Church of Christ  Congregational in the Marshall Islands , with 51.5 % of the population ; the Assemblies of God , 24.2 % ; the Roman Catholic ( term ) Catholic Church , 8.4 % ; and The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints in the Marshall Islands The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints ( Mormons ) , 8.3 % . Also represented are Bukot Nan Jesus ( also known as Assembly of God Part Two ) , 2.2 % ; Baptist , 1.0 % ; Seventh-day Adventists , 0.9 % ; Full Gospel , 0.7 % ; and the Bah Faith , 0.6 % . Persons Nonreligious account for a very small percentage of the population . Islam is also present through Ahmadiyya which is based in Majuro , with the first mosque opening in the capital in September 2012.
===Health===
During the Castle Bravo test of the first deployable thermonuclear bomb , a miscalculation resulted in the explosion being over twice as large as predicted . The nuclear fallout spread eastward onto the inhabited Rongelap Atoll and Rongerik Atolls . These islands were not evacuated before the explosion . Many of the Marshall Islands natives have since suffered from radiation burns and radioactive dusting , suffering the similar fates as the Japanese fishermen aboard the Daigo Fukury Maru , but have received little , if any , compensation from the U.S. government .
==Government==
The government of the Marshall Islands operates under a mixed parliamentary-presidential system as set forth in its Constitution of the Marshall Islands . Elections are held every four years in universal suffrage ( for all citizens above 18 ) , with each of the twenty-four constituencies ( see below ) electing one or more representatives ( senators ) to the lower house of RMI 's unicameral legislature , the Nitijela . ( Majuro , the capital atoll , elects five senators . ) The President , who is head of state as well as head of government , is elected by the 33 senators of the Nitijela . Four of the five Marshallese presidents who have been elected since the Constitution was adopted in 1979 have been traditional paramount chiefs .
In January 2016 , senator Hilda Heine was elected by Parliament as the first female president of the Marshall Islands ; previous president Casten Nemra lost office after serving two weeks in a vote of no confidence .
Legislative power lies with the Nitijela . The upper house of Parliament , called the Council of Iroij , is an advisory body comprising twelve paramount chiefs . The executive branch consists of the President and the Presidential Cabinet , which consists of ten ministers appointed by the President with the approval of the Nitijela . The twenty-four electoral districts into which the country is divided correspond to the inhabited islands and atolls . There are currently four political parties in the Marshall Islands : Aelon Kein Ad ( AKA ) , United People 's Party ( Marshall Islands ) United People 's Party ( UPP ) , Kien Eo Am ( KEA ) and United Democratic Party ( Marshall Islands ) ( UDP ) . Rule is shared by the AKA and the UDP . The following senators are in the legislative body :

===Foreign affairs and defense===
The Compact of Free Association with the United States gives the U.S. sole responsibility for international defense of the Marshall Islands . It gives islanders the right to emigrate to the United States and to work there .
The Marshall Islands was admitted to the United Nations based on the United Nations Security Council 's recommendation on August 9 , 1991 , in United Nations Security Council Resolution 704 and the United Nations General Assembly 's approval on September 17 , 1991 , in Resolution 46/3 . In international politics within the United Nations , the Marshall Islands has often voted consistently with the United States with respect to General Assembly resolutions .
On April 28 , 2015 , the Iranian navy seized the Marshall Island-flagged MV Maersk Tigris near the Strait of Hormuz . The ship had been chartered by Germany 's Rickmers Ship Management , which stated that the ship contained no special cargo and no military weapons . The ship was reported to be under the control of the Iranian Revolutionary Guard according to the Pentagon . Tensions escalated in the region due to the intensifying of SaudiYemeni War Saudi-led coalition attacks in Yemen . The Pentagon reported that the destroyer USS Farragut ( DDG-99 ) and a maritime reconnaissance aircraft were dispatched upon receiving a distress call from the ship Tigris and it was also reported that all 34 crew members were detained . US Defense Department officials have said that they would review U.S. defense obligations to the Government of the Marshall Islands in the wake of recent events and also condemned the shots fired at the bridge as `` inappropriate '' . It was reported in May 2015 that Tehran would release the ship after it paid a penalty .
In March 2017 , at the 34th regular session of the UN Human Rights Council , Vanuatu made a joint statement on behalf of the Marshall Islands and some other Pacific nations raising human rights violations in the Western New Guinea , which has been occupied by Indonesia since 1963 , and requested that the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights produce a report . Indonesia rejected allegations . More than 100,000 Papuans have died during a 50-year Papua conflict .
Since 1991 the Republic of Marshall Islands Sea Patrol , a division of Marshall Islands Police , has operated the 160 ton patrol vessel RMIS Lomor ( 03 ) . Lomor is one of 22 Pacific Forum patrol vessels Australia provided to smaller nations in the Pacific Islands Forum . While some other nations ' missions for their vessels include sovereignty , protection , the terms of the Compact of Free Association restrict Lomor to civilian missions , like fishery protection and search and rescue .
In 2021 , the governments of Australia and Japan decided to fund two major law enforcement developments of the Marshall Islands .
In February 2021 , the Marshall Islands announced it would be formally withdrawing from the Pacific Islands Forum in a joint statement with Kiribati , Nauru , and the Federated States of Micronesia after a dispute regarding Henry Puna 's election as the Forum 's secretary-general .
==Culture==
Although the ancient skills are now in decline , the Marshallese were once able navigation , using the celestial navigation and Marshall Islands stick chart stick-and-shell charts .
== Sports ==
=== Association football ===
The Marshall Islands have a small club league , including Koober as the most successful club . One tournament was held by Play Soccer Make Peace . There is a small Football Association on the island of Majuro . The sport of association football in its growth is new to the Marshall Islands . The Marshall Islands does not have a Football team presently . The Marshall Islands is the only sovereign country in the world that does not have a record of a national football match .
=== Marshall Islands Baseball / Softball Federation ===
Softball and baseball are held under one sports federation in the Marshall Islands . The President is Jeimata Nokko Kabua . Both sports are growing at a fast pace with hundreds of Marshallese people behind the Marshall Islands Baseball / Softball Federation . The Marshall Islands achieved a silver medal in the Micronesian Games in 2012 , as well as medals in the SPG Games .
==Economy==
The islands have few natural resources , and their imports far exceed exports . According to the CIA , the value of exports in 2013 was approximately $ 53.7 million while estimated imports were $ 133.7 million . Agricultural products include coconuts , tomatoes , melons , taro , breadfruit , fruits , pigs and chickens . Industry is made of the production of copra and craft items , tuna processing and tourism . The GDP in 2016 was an estimated $ 180 million , with a real growth rate of 1.7 % . The GDP per capita was $ 3,300 .
The International Monetary Fund reported in mid-2016 that the economy of the Republic had expanded by about 0.5 percent in the Fiscal Year 2015 thanks to an improved fisheries sector . A surplus of 3 % of GDP was recorded `` owing to record-high fishing license fees . Growth is expected to rise to about 1.5 percent and inflation to about 0.5 percent in FY2016 , as the effects of the drought in earlier 2016 are offset by the resumption of infrastructure projects . ''
In 2018 , the Republic of Marshall Islands passed the Sovereign Currency Act of 2018 , which made it the first country to issue their own cryptocurrency and certify it as legal tender ; the currency is called the `` sovereign '' .
=== Shipping ===
The Marshall Islands plays a vital role in the international shipping industry as a flag of convenience for commercial vessels . The Marshallese registry began operations in 1990 , and is managed through a joint venture with International Registries , Inc. , a US-based corporation that has offices in major shipping centers worldwide . As of 2017 , the Marshallese ship registry was the second largest in the world , after that of Panama .
Unlike some flag countries , there is no requirement that a Marshallese flag vessel be owned by a Marshallese individual or corporation . Following the 2015 seizure of the MV Maersk Tigris , the United States announced that its treaty obligation to defend the Marshall Islands did not extend to foreign-owned Marshallese flag vessels at sea .
As a result of ship-to-ship transfers by Marshallese flag tanker vessels , the Marshall Islands have statistically been one of the largest importers of crude oil from the United States , despite the fact that the islands have no oil refining capacity .
===Labor===
In 2007 , the Marshall Islands joined the International Labour Organization , which means its labor laws will comply with international benchmarks . This may affect business conditions in the islands .
===Taxation===
The income tax has two brackets , with rates of 8 % and 12 % . The corporate tax is 3 % of revenue .
===Foreign assistance===
United States government assistance is the mainstay of the economy . Under terms of the Amended Compact of Free Association , the U.S. is committed to provide US $ 57.7 million per year in assistance to the Marshall Islands ( RMI ) through 2013 , and then US $ 62.7 million through 2023 , at which time a trust fund , made up of U.S. and RMI contributions , will begin perpetual annual payouts .
The United States Army maintains the Ronald Reagan Ballistic Missile Defense Test Site on Kwajalein Atoll . Marshallese land owners receive rent for the base .
===Agriculture===
Agricultural production is concentrated on small farms . The most important commercial crop is copra , followed by coconut , breadfruit , Pandanus tectorius , banana , Cyrtosperma merkusii and Tacca leontopetaloides . The livestock consists primarily of pigs and chickens .
===Industry===
Small-scale industry is limited to handicrafts , fish processing , and copra .
===Fishing===
Majuro is the world 's busiest tuna transshipment port in the world , with 704 transshipments totaling 444,393 tons in 2015 . Majuro is also a tuna processing center ; the Pan Pacific Foods plant exports processed tuna to a number of countries , primarily the United States under the Bumble Bee Foods brand . Fishing license fees , primarily for tuna , provide noteworthy income for the government .
In 1999 , a private company built a tuna loining plant with more than 400 employees , mostly women . But the plant closed in 2005 after a failed attempt to convert it to produce tuna steaks , a process that requires half as many employees . Operating costs exceeded revenue , and the plant 's owners tried to partner with the government to prevent closure . But government officials personally interested in an economic stake in the plant refused to help . After the plant closed , it was taken over by the government , which had been the guarantor of a $ 2 million loan to the business .
===Energy===
On September 15 , 2007 , Witon Barry ( of the Tobolar Copra processing plant in the Marshall Islands capital of Majuro ) said power authorities , private companies , and entrepreneurs had been experimenting with coconut oil as alternative to diesel fuel for vehicles , electricity generation , and ships . Coconut trees abound in the Pacific 's tropical islands . Copra , the meat of the coconut , yields coconut oil ( 1 liter for every 6 to 10 coconuts ) . In 2009 , a 57 ; kW solar power plant was installed , the largest in the Pacific at the time , including New Zealand . It is estimated that 330 ; kW of solar and 450 ; kW of wind power would be required to make the College of the Marshall Islands energy self-sufficient . Marshalls Energy Company ( MEC ) , a government entity , provides the islands with electricity . In 2008 , 420 solar home systems of 200 Wp each were installed on Ailinglaplap Atoll , sufficient for limited electricity use .
==Education==
The Ministry of Education ( Marshall Islands ) is the education agency of the islands . Marshall Islands Public School System operates the state schools in the Marshall Islands .
In the 19941995 school year the country had 103 elementary schools and 13 secondary schools . There were 27 private elementary schools and one private high school . Christian groups operated most of the private schools .
Historically the Marshallese population was taught in English first with Marshallese instruction coming later , but this was reversed in the 1990s to keep the islands ' cultural heritage and so children could write in Marshallese . Now English language instruction begins in grade 3 . Christine McMurray and Roy Smith wrote in Diseases of Globalization : Socioeconomic Transition and Health that this could potentially weaken the children 's English skills .
There are two tertiary education institutions operating in the Marshall Islands , the College of the Marshall Islands and the University of the South Pacific .
==Transportation==
The Marshall Islands are served by the Marshall Islands International Airport in Majuro , the Bucholz Army Airfield in Kwajalein , and List of airports in the Marshall Islands .
Airlines include United Airlines , Nauru Airlines , Air Marshall Islands , and Asia Pacific Airlines ( United States ) .

Germany ( Deutschland , ) , officially the Federal Republic of Germany ( Bundesrepublik Deutschland links=no , ) , is a country at the intersection of Central Europe and Western Europe . It is situated between the Baltic Sea and North Sea seas to the north , and the Alps to the south . It borders Denmark to the north , Poland and the Czech Republic to the east , Austria and Switzerland to the south , and France , Luxembourg , Belgium , and the Netherlands to the west , and covers an area of .
Various Germanic tribes have inhabited the northern parts of modern Germany since classical antiquity . A region named Germania was documented before AD 100 . Beginning in the 10th century , German territories formed a central part of the Holy Roman Empire . During the 16th century , Northern Germany became the centre of the Protestant Reformation . Following the Napoleonic Wars and the dissolution of the Holy Roman Empire in 1806 , the German Confederation was formed in 1815 .

After World War I and the German Revolution of 19181919 , the Empire was replaced by the semi-presidential Weimar Republic . The Adolf Hitler 's rise to power in 1933 led to the establishment of Nazi Germany , World War II , and the Holocaust . After the end of World War II in Europe and a period of Allied-occupied Germany , two new German states were founded : the Federal Republic of Germany , generally known as West Germany , and the German Democratic Republic , East Germany . The Federal Republic of Germany was a founding member of the European Economic Community and the European Union , while the German Democratic Republic was a communist Eastern Bloc state and member of the Warsaw Pact . After the Peaceful Revolution , German reunification saw the New states of Germany join the Federal Republic of Germany on German Unity Day .
Today , Germany is a Federalism Parliamentary system republic led by a Chancellor of Germany ( Federal Republic of Germany ) . With over 83 million inhabitants of its 16 States of Germany , it is the List of European countries by population second-most populous country in Europe after Russia , as well as the most populous member state of the European Union . Its capital and largest city is Berlin , and its financial centre is Frankfurt ; the largest urban area is the Ruhr .
Germany is a great power with Economy of Germany ; it has the List of sovereign states in Europe by GDP ( nominal ) , the world 's List of countries by GDP ( nominal ) fourth-largest economy by nominal GDP , and the List of countries by GDP ( PPP ) fifth-largest by PPP . As a global leader in several industrial , Science and technology in Germany sectors , it is both the world 's List of countries by exports third-largest exporter and List of countries by imports of goods . As a developed country , which List of countries by Human Development Index very high on the Human Development Index , it Social security in Germany and Healthcare in Germany , environmental protections , and Higher education in Germany a tuition-free university education .

== Etymology ==
The English word Germany derives from the Latin Germania , which came into use after Julius Caesar adopted it for the peoples east of the Rhine . The German language term Deutschland , originally diutisciu land ( `` the German lands '' ) is derived from , descended from Old High German diutisc `` of the people '' ( from diot or diota `` people '' ) , originally used to distinguish the Vernacular from Latin and its Romance languages . This in turn descends from Proto-Germanic language Proto-Germanic wikt : Reconstruction : Proto-Germanic/iudiskaz `` of the people '' ( see also the Latinised form Theodiscus ) , derived from wikt : Reconstruction : Proto-Germanic/eud , descended from Proto-Indo-European language Proto-Indo-European * `` people '' , from which the word Teutons also originates .
== History ==
Ancient humans were present in Germany at least 600,000 years ago . The first non-modern human fossil ( the Neanderthal ) was discovered in the Neandertal ( valley ) . Similarly dated evidence of modern humans has been found in the Swabian Jura , including 42,000-year-old flutes which are the oldest musical instruments ever found , the 40,000-year-old Lion-man , and the 35,000-year-old Venus of Hohle Fels .

The Germanic peoples are ethnogenesis the Nordic Bronze Age or the Pre-Roman Iron Age . From southern Scandinavia and north Germany , they expanded south , east , and west , coming into contact with the Celtsic , Iranian peoples , Balts , and Slavs tribes .
Under Augustus , Roman Empire began to invade Germania . In 9 ; AD , three Roman legions were Battle of the Teutoburg Forest by Arminius . By 100 ; AD , when Tacitus wrote Germania ( book ) , Germanic tribes had settled along the Rhine and the Danube ( the Limes Germanicus ) , occupying most of modern Germany . However , Baden Wrttemberg , southern Bavaria , southern Hesse and the western Rhineland had been Germanic Wars into Roman provinces . Around 260 , Germanic peoples broke into Roman-controlled lands . After the invasion of the Huns in 375 , and with the decline of Rome from 395 , Germanic tribes moved farther southwest : the Franks established the Frankish Kingdom and pushed east to subjugate Duchy of Saxony and Duchy of Bavaria , and areas of what is today eastern Germany were inhabited by West Slavs tribes .
=== East Francia and Holy Roman Empire ===
Charlemagne founded the Carolingian Empire in 800 ; it was Treaty of Verdun and the Holy Roman Empire emerged from the eastern portion . The territory initially known as East Francia stretched from the Rhine in the west to the Elbe River in the east and from the North Sea to the Alps .

In 996 Pope Gregory V became the first German Pope , appointed by his cousin Otto III , whom he shortly after crowned Holy Roman Emperor . The Holy Roman Empire absorbed northern Italy and Burgundy ( historical region ) under the Salian emperors ( 10241125 ) , although the emperors lost power through the Investiture controversy .
Under the House of Hohenstaufen emperors ( 11381254 ) , German princes encouraged History of German settlement in Central and Eastern Europe to the south and east ( Ostsiedlung ) . Members of the Hanseatic League , mostly north German towns , prospered in the expansion of trade . Population declined starting with the Great Famine of 13151317 in 1315 , followed by the Black Death of 134850 . The Golden Bull of 1356 issued in 1356 provided the constitutional structure of the Empire and codified the election of the emperor by seven prince-electors .
Johannes Gutenberg introduced moveable-type printing to Europe , laying the basis for the democratization of knowledge . In 1517 , Martin Luther incited the Protestant Reformation ; the 1555 Peace of Augsburg tolerated the `` Evangelical '' faith ( Lutheranism ) , but also decreed that the faith of the prince was to be the faith of his subjects ( cuius regio , eius religio ) . From the Cologne War through the Thirty Years ' Wars ( 16181648 ) , religious conflict devastated German lands and significantly reduced the population .
The Peace of Westphalia ended religious warfare among the Imperial Estates ; their mostly German-speaking rulers were able to choose Roman Catholicism , Lutheranism , or the Reformed faith as their official religion . The legal system initiated by a series of Imperial Reforms ( approximately 14951555 ) provided for considerable local autonomy and a stronger Imperial Diet ( Holy Roman Empire ) . The House of Habsburg held the imperial crown from 1438 until the death of Charles VI , Holy Roman Emperor in 1740 . Following the War of Austrian Succession and the Treaty of Aix-la-Chapelle ( 1748 ) Treaty of Aix-la-Chapelle , Charles VI 's daughter Maria Theresa ruled as Queen consort when her husband , Francis I , Holy Roman Emperor , became Emperor .

During the period of the French Revolutionary Wars , the Napoleonic era and the subsequent Final Recess of the Reichsdeputation , most of the Free Imperial Cities were annexed by dynastic territories ; the ecclesiastical territories were secularised and annexed . In 1806 the Imperium was dissolved ; France , Russia , Prussia and the Habsburgs ( Austria ) competed for hegemony in the German states during the Napoleonic Wars .
=== German Confederation and Empire ===
Following the fall of Napoleon , the Congress of Vienna founded the German Confederation , a loose league of States of the German Confederation .

King William I , German Emperor appointed Otto von Bismarck as the Minister President of Prussia in 1862 . Bismarck successfully concluded the Second Schleswig War ; the subsequent decisive Prussian victory in the Austro-Prussian War of 1866 enabled him to create the North German Confederation which excluded Austrian Empire . After the defeat of France in the Franco-Prussian War , the German princes proclaimed the founding of the German Empire in 1871 . Prussia was the dominant constituent state of the new empire ; the King of Prussia ruled as its Kaiser , and Berlin became its capital .
In the Grnderzeit period following the unification of Germany , Bismarck 's foreign policy as Chancellor of Germany secured Germany 's position as a great nation by forging alliances and avoiding war .

=== East and West Germany ===
After Nazi Germany surrendered , the Allies of World War II partitioned Berlin and Germany 's remaining territory into four occupation zones . The western sectors , controlled by France , the United Kingdom , and the United States , were merged on 23 May 1949 to form the West Germany ( Bundesrepublik Deutschland ) ; on 7 October 1949 , the Soviet Zone became the East Germany ( Deutsche Demokratische Republik ; DDR ) . They were informally known as West Germany and East Germany . East Germany selected East Berlin as its capital , while West Germany chose Bonn as a provisional capital , to emphasise its stance that the two-state solution was temporary .
West Germany was established as a federal parliamentary republic with a `` social market economy '' . Starting in 1948 West Germany became a major recipient of reconstruction aid under the Marshall Plan . Konrad Adenauer was elected the first Federal Chancellor of the Federal Republic of Germany of Germany in 1949 . The country enjoyed prolonged economic growth ( Wirtschaftswunder ) beginning in the early 1950s . West Germany joined NATO in 1955 and was a founding member of the European Economic Community .
East Germany was an Eastern Bloc state under political and military control by the USSR via occupation forces and the Warsaw Pact . Although East Germany claimed to be a democracy , political power was exercised solely by leading members ( Politburo ) of the communist-controlled Socialist Unity Party of Germany , supported by the Stasi , an immense secret service . While Communist propaganda was based on the benefits of the GDR 's social programmes and the alleged threat of a West German invasion , many of its citizens looked to the West for freedom and prosperity . The Berlin Wall , built in 1961 , prevented East German citizens from escaping to West Germany , becoming a symbol of the Cold War .
Tensions between East and West Germany were reduced in the late 1960s by Chancellor Willy Brandt 's Ostpolitik . In 1989 , Hungary decided to dismantle the Iron Curtain and Removal of Hungary 's border fence with Austria , causing the emigration of thousands of East Germans to West Germany via Hungary and Austria . This had devastating effects on the GDR , where regular Monday demonstrations in East Germany received increasing support . In an effort to help retain East Germany as a state , the East German authorities eased border restrictions , but this actually led to an acceleration of the Wende reform process culminating in the Treaty on the Final Settlement with Respect to Germany under which Germany regained full sovereignty . This permitted German reunification on 3 October 1990 , with the accession of the New states of Germany five re-established states of the former GDR . The fall of the Wall in 1989 became a symbol of the Fall of Communism , the Dissolution of the Soviet Union , German Reunification and Die Wende .

Mauritius ( ; Maurice ; Moris Wiktionary : Appendix : Mauritian Creole pronunciation [ mois ] ) , officially the Republic of Mauritius , is an island nation in the Indian Ocean about 2,000 kilometres ( 1,200 ; mi ) off the southeast coast of the African continent , east of Madagascar . It includes the main island ( also called Mauritius ) , as well as and Rodrigues , Agalga and St. Brandon . The islands of Mauritius and Rodrigues , along with nearby Runion ( a Departments of France ) , are part of the Mascarene Islands . The capital and largest city , Port Louis , is located on Mauritius , where most of the population is concentrated . The country spans and has an Exclusive Economic Zone covering 2.3 million square kilometres .
By some accounts , Arab sailors were the first to discover the uninhabited island , around 975 , and they called it Dina Arobi , but this has not been confirmed . The earliest confirmed discovery was in 1507 by Portuguese sailors , who otherwise took little interest in the islands . The Dutch took possession in 1598 , establishing a succession of short-lived settlements over a period of about 120 years , before abandoning their efforts in 1710 . France took control in 1715 , renaming it Isle de France ( Mauritius ) . In 1810 , the island Invasion of Isle de France by United Kingdom , and four years later France Treaty of Paris ( 1814 ) to Britain . As a British colony , Mauritius included Rodrigues , Agalega , St. Brandon , Tromelin Island , the Chagos Archipelago , and , until 1906 , the Seychelles . Sovereignty over Tromelin is disputed between Mauritius and France , as it was not specifically mentioned in the Treaty of Paris . Mauritius remained a primarily plantation-based colony of the United Kingdom until independence in 1968.
In 1965 , three years before Mauritius became independent , the UK split off the Chagos Archipelago from Mauritian territory , and also split off the islands of Aldabra , Farquhar , and Desroches from the Seychelles , to form the British Indian Ocean Territory ( BIOT ) . The Expulsion of the Chagossians and the largest island , Diego Garcia , was leased to the United States . The UK has restricted access to the Chagos Archipelago , allowing entry to casual tourists , the media , and former inhabitants . The sovereignty of the Chagos is Chagos Archipelago sovereignty dispute between Mauritius and the UK . In February 2019 , the International Court of Justice issued an advisory opinion ordering the UK to return the Chagos Islands to Mauritius as rapidly as possible to complete the decolonisation of Mauritius .

Along with the other Mascarene Islands , Mauritius is known for its Wildlife of Mauritius . Many species are endemic to the island . The island was the only known home of the dodo , which , along with several other avian species , was made extinct by human activities relatively soon after the island 's settlement .
==Etymology==
The first historical evidence of the existence of an island now known as Mauritius is on a map produced by the Italian people cartographer Alberto Cantino in 1502 . From this , it appears that Mauritius bore the name Dina Arobi , very likely the name shared with the Portuguese by sailors from the subcontinent . In 1507 , Portuguese sailors visited the uninhabited island . The island appears with a Portuguese language name Cirne on early Portuguese maps , probably from the name of a ship in the 1507 expedition . Another Portuguese sailor , Dom ( title ) Pedro Mascarenhas , gave the name Mascarene Islands to the Archipelago .
In 1598 , Dutch squadron under Admiral Wybrand van Warwyck landed at Grand Port and named the island Mauritius , in honour of Maurice , Prince of Orange , stadtholder of the Dutch Republic . Later the island became a French colony and was renamed Isle de France ( Mauritius ) . On 3 December 1810 , the French surrendered the island to Great Britain during the Napoleonic Wars . Under British rule , the island 's name reverted to Mauritius . Mauritius is also commonly known as Maurice ( ) and le Maurice in French , Moris ( ) in Mauritian Creole .
==History==
===Early history===
The island of Mauritius was uninhabited before its first recorded visit by Portuguese sailors in the beginning of the 16th century . The name Dina Arobi has been associated with Arab sailors .
===Portuguese Mauritius===
The Treaty of Tordesillas purported to give Portugal the right to colonise this part of world . In 1507 , Portugal sailors came to the uninhabited island and established a visiting base . Diogo Fernandes Pereira , a Portuguese navigator , was the first European known to land in Mauritius . He named the island `` Ilha do Cirne '' ( `` Island of Cirne '' ) . The Portuguese did not stay long as they were not interested in these islands .
The Mascarene Islands were named after Pedro Mascarenhas , Viceroy of Portuguese India , after his visit to the islands in 1512.
Rodrigues ( island ) was named after Portuguese discoveries Diogo Rodrigues , who first came upon the island in 1528.
===Dutch Mauritius ( 16381710 ) ===
In 1598 a Dutch squadron under Admiral Wybrand Van Warwyck landed at Grand Port and named the island `` Mauritius '' after Maurice , Prince of Orange ( Dutch language : Maurits van Nassau ) of the Dutch Republic . The Dutch inhabited the island in 1638 , from which they exploited ebony trees and introduced sugar cane , domestic animals and deer . It was from here that Dutch navigator Abel Tasman set out to seek the Great Southern Land , mapping parts of Tasmania , Aotearoa/New Zealand and New Guinea . The first Dutch settlement lasted 20 years . In 1639 slaves arrived in Mauritius from Madagascar . The Dutch East India Company brought them to cut down ebony trees and to work in the new tobacco and sugar cane plantations . Several attempts to establish a colony permanently were subsequently made , but the settlements never developed enough to produce dividends , causing the Dutch to abandon Mauritius in 1710.
===French Mauritius ( 17151810 ) ===
France , which already controlled neighbouring le Bourbon ( now Runion ) , took control of Mauritius in 1715 and renamed it Isle de France ( Mauritius ) . In 1723 , the Code Noir was established to categorise one group of human beings as `` goods '' , in order for the owner of these goods to be able to obtain insurance money and compensation in case of loss of his `` goods '' . The 1735 arrival of French governor Bertrand-Franois Mah de La Bourdonnais coincided with development of a prosperous economy based on sugar production . Mah de La Bourdonnais established Port Louis as a naval base and a shipbuilding centre . Under his governorship , numerous buildings were erected , a number of which are still standing . These include part of Government House , the Chteau de Mon Plaisir , and the Line Barracks , the headquarters of the Mauritius Police Force . The island was under the administration of the French East India Company , which maintained its presence until 1767 . During the French rule slaves were brought from parts of Africa such as Mozambique and Zanzibar . As a result the island 's population rose dramatically from 15,000 to 49,000 within 30 thirty years . During the late eighteenth century African slaves accounted for around 80 percent of the island  s population , and by the early nineteenth century there were 60,000 slaves on the island . In early 1729 Indians from Pondicherry Pondicherry , India arrived in Mauritius aboard the vessel La Sirne . Work contracts for these craftsmen were signed in 1734 at the time when they acquired their freedom .
From 1767 to 1810 , except for a brief period during the French Revolution when the inhabitants set up a government virtually independent of France , the island was controlled by officials appointed by the French government . Jacques-Henri Bernardin de Saint-Pierre lived on the island from 1768 to 1771 , then went back to France , where he wrote Paul et Virginie , a love story that made the Isle de France famous wherever the French language was spoken . In 1796 the settlers broke away from French control when the government in Paris attempted to abolish slavery . Two famous French governors were the Vicomte de Souillac ( who constructed the Chausse in Port Louis and encouraged farmers to settle in the district of Savanne ) and Antoine Bruni d'Entrecasteaux ( who saw to it that the French in the Indian Ocean should have their headquarters in Mauritius instead of Pondicherry in India ) . Charles Mathieu Isidore Decaen was a successful general in the French Revolutionary Wars and , in some ways , a rival of Napolon I . He ruled as Governor of Isle de France ( Mauritius ) and Runion from 1803 to 1810 . British naval cartographer and explorer Matthew Flinders was arrested and detained by General Decaen on the island from 1803 to 1810 , in contravention of an order from Napolon . During the Napoleonic Wars , Mauritius became a base from which French corsairs organised successful raids on British commercial ships . The raids continued until 1810 , when a Royal Navy expedition led by Commodore ( Royal Navy ) Josias Rowley , Royal Navy R.N. , an Anglo-Irish aristocracy ( class ) , was sent to capture the island . Despite winning the Battle of Grand Port , the only French naval victory over the British during these wars , the Invasion of le de France at Cap Malheureux three months later . They formally surrendered the island on the fifth day of the invasion , 3 December 1810 , on terms allowing settlers to keep their land and property and to use the French language and law of France in criminal and civil matters . Under British rule , the island 's name reverted to Mauritius . The swift conquest of Mauritius was fictionalised in the novel The Mauritius Command by Patrick O'Brian , first published in 1977.
===British Mauritius ( 18101968 ) ===
The British administration , which began with Robert Townsend Farquhar as Governor of British Mauritius , led to rapid social and economic changes . However , it was tainted by the Ratsitatane episode . Ratsitatane , nephew of King Radama of Madagascar , was brought to Mauritius as a political prisoner . He managed to escape from prison and plotted a rebellion that would free the island 's slaves . He was betrayed by an associate and was caught by the British forces , summarily judged , and condemned to death . He was beheaded at Plaine Verte on 15 April 1822 , and his head was displayed as a deterrent against future uprisings among the slaves .
In 1832 , Adrien d'pinay launched the first Mauritian newspaper ( Le Cernen ) , which was not controlled by the government . In the same year , there was a move by the procureur-general to abolish slavery without compensation to the slave owners . This gave rise to discontent , and , to check an eventual rebellion , the government ordered all the inhabitants to surrender their arms . Furthermore , a stone fortress , Fort Adelaide , was built on a hill ( now known as the Citadel hill ) in the centre of Port Louis to quell any uprising .
Slavery was abolished in 1835 , and the planters ultimately received two million pounds sterling in compensation for the loss of their slaves , who had been imported from Africa and Madagascar during the French occupation . The Abolitionism in the United Kingdom had important impacts on Mauritius 's society , economy and population . The planters brought a large number of Indentured servant from India to work in the sugar cane fields . Between 1834 and 1921 , around half a million indentured labourers were present on the island . They worked on sugar estates , factories , in transport and on construction sites . Additionally , the British brought 8,740 Indian people soldiers to the island . Aapravasi Ghat , in the bay at Port Louis and now a UNESCO site , was the first British colony to serve as a major reception centre for indentured servants .
An important figure of the 19th century was Rmy Ollier , a journalist of mixed origin . In 1828 , the colour bar was officially abolished in Mauritius , but British governors gave little power to coloured persons , and appointed only whites as leading officials . Rmy Ollier petitioned to Queen Victoria to allow coloureds in the council of government , and this became possible a few years later . He also made Port Louis become a municipality so that the citizens could administer the town through their own elected representatives . A street has been named after him in Port Louis , and his bust was erected in the Jardin de la Compagnie in 1906 . In 1885 Constitution of Mauritius ( 1885 ) was introduced and it was referred to a Cens Dmocratique as it incorporated some of the principles advocated by one of the Creole leaders called Onesipho Beaugeard . It created elected positions in the Legislative Council although the franchise was restricted mainly to the white French and fair-skinned Creole elite who owned real estate . In 1886 Governor John Pope Hennessy nominated Gnanadicarayen Arlanda as the first ever Indo-Mauritian member of the ruling Council despite the sugar oligarchy 's preference for rival Indo-Mauritian Emile Sandapa . Arlanda served until 1891 . Two main political parties were active at that time , the pro-Hennessy party being Sir William Newton 's Reform Party where as the anti-Hennessy party Democrats was led by Gustave de Coriolis and Onsipho Beaugeard .
The labourers brought from India were not always fairly treated , and a German , Adolph von Plevitz , made himself the unofficial protector of these immigrants . He mixed with many of the labourers , and in 1871 helped them to write a petition that was sent to Arthur Hamilton-Gordon , 1st Baron Stanmore . A commission was appointed to look into the complaints made by the Indian immigrants , and in 1872 two lawyers , appointed by the British Crown , were sent from England to make an inquiry . This Royal Commission recommended several measures that would affect the lives of Indian labourers during the next fifty years .
In November 1901 , Mahatma Gandhi visited Mauritius , on his way from South Africa to India . He stayed on the island for two weeks , and urged the Indo-Mauritian community to take an interest in education and to play a more active role in politics . Back in India , he sent over a young lawyer , Manilal Doctor , to improve the plight of the Indo-Mauritians . During the same year , faster links were established with the island of Rodrigues thanks to the wireless .
In 1903 , motorcars were introduced in Mauritius , and in 1910 the first taxis , operated by Joseph Merven , came into service . The electrification of Port Louis took place in 1909 , and in the same decade the Mauritius Hydro Electric Company of the Amode Ibrahim Atchia was authorised to provide power to the towns of upper Plaines Wilhems .
The 1910s were a period of political agitation . The rising middle class ( made up of doctors , lawyers , and teachers ) began to challenge the political power of the sugar cane landowners . Dr. Eugne Laurent , mayor of Port Louis , was the leader of this new group ; his party , Action Librale , demanded that more people should be allowed to vote in the elections . Action Librale was opposed by the Parti de l'Ordre , led by Henri Leclzio , the most influential of the sugar magnates . In 1911 there were riots in Port Louis due to a false rumour that Dr. Eugne Laurent had been murdered by the oligarchs in Curepipe . This became known as the 1911 Curepipe riots . Shops and offices were damaged in the capital , and one person was killed . In the same year , 1911 , the first public cinema shows took place in Curepipe , and , in the same town , a stone building was erected to house the Royal College . In 1912 , a wider telephone network came into service , used by the government , business firms , and a few private households .
World War I broke out in August 1914 . Many Mauritians volunteered to fight in Europe against the Germans and in Mesopotamia against the Turks . But the war affected Mauritius much less than the wars of the eighteenth century . In fact , the 19141918 war was a period of great prosperity due to a boom in sugar prices . In 1919 the Mauritius Sugar Syndicate came into being , which included 70 % of all sugar producers .
The 1920s saw the rise of a `` retrocessionism '' movement , which favoured the retrocession of Mauritius to France . The movement rapidly collapsed because none of the candidates who wanted Mauritius to be given back to France were elected in the 1921 elections . In the post-war recession , there was a sharp drop in sugar prices . Many sugar estates closed down , marking the end of an era for the sugar magnates who had not only controlled the economy but also the political life of the country . Raoul Rivet , the editor of Le Mauricien newspaper , campaigned for a revision of the constitution that would give the emerging middle class a greater role in the running of the country . The principles of Arya Samaj began to infiltrate the Hindu community , who clamoured for more social justice . At the 1926 elections Dunputh Lallah and Rajcoomar Gujadhur became the first Indo-Mauritians to be elected at the Legislative Council . At Grand Port Lallah won over rivals Fernand Louis Morel and Gaston Gebert ; at Flacq Gujadhur defeated Pierre Montocchio . After the end of nominated Arlanda 's term in 1891 and until 1926 there had been no Indo-Mauritian representation in the Legislative Council .
1936 saw the birth of the Labour Party ( Mauritius ) , launched by Dr. Maurice Cur . Emmanuel Anquetil rallied the urban workers while Pandit Sahadeo concentrated on the rural working class . The Uba riots of 1937 resulted in reforms by the local British government that improved labour conditions and led to the un-banning of labour unions . Labour Day was celebrated for the first time in 1938 . More than 30,000 workers sacrificed a day 's wage and came from all over the island to attend a giant meeting at the Champ de Mars . Following the dockers ' strikes trade unionist Emmanuel Anquetil was deported to Rodrigues , Maurice Cur and Pandit Sahadeo were placed under house arrest whilst numerous strikers were jailed . Governor Sir Bede Clifford assisted Mr Jules Leclezio of the Mauritius Sugar Syndicate to counter the effects of the strike by using alternative workers known as  black legs  .
At the outbreak of World War II in 1939 , many Mauritians volunteered to serve under the British flag in Africa and the Near East , fighting against the German and Italian armies . Some went to England to become pilots and ground staff in the Royal Air Force . Mauritius was never really threatened but several British ships were sunk outside Port Louis by German submarines in 1943.
During World War II , conditions were hard in the country ; the prices of commodities doubled but workers  salaries increased only by 10 to 20 percent . There was civil unrest , and the colonial government censored all trade union activities . However , the labourers of Belle Vue Harel Sugar Estate went on strike on 27 September 1943 . Police officers eventually fired directly at the crowd , resulting in the deaths of 4 labourers Soondrum Pavatdan ( better known as Anjalay Coopen the 32 year old pregnant woman ) , Moonsamy Moonien ( 14 year old boy ) , Kistnasamy Mooneesamy ( 37 year old labourer ) , and Marday Panapen . This became known as the Belle Vue Harel Massacre . Social worker and leader of the Jan Andolan movement Basdeo Bissoondoyal organised the funeral ceremonies of the 4 dead labourers . Three months later Basdeo Bissoondoyal organised a mass gathering at `` Marie Reine de la Paix '' in Port Louis on 12 December 1943 and the significant crowd of workers from all over the island confirmed the popularity of his movement Jan Andolan .
After the proclamation of the new 1947 Constitution the general elections were held on 9 August 1948 and for the first time the colonial government expanded the franchise to all adults who could write their name in one of the island 's 19 languages . Guy Rozemont 's Labour Party ( Mauritius ) won the majority of the votes with 11 of the 19 elected seats won by Hinduism . However , the Governor of British Mauritius Governor-General Donald Mackenzie-Kennedy appointed 12 Conservatives to the Legislative Council on 23 August 1948 to perpetuate the predominance of white Franco-Mauritians . In 1948 Emilienne Rochecouste became the first woman to be elected to the Legislative Council , serving until 1953 . Guy Rozemont 's party bettered its position in 1953 , and , on the strength of the election results , demanded universal suffrage . Constitutional conferences were held in London in 1955 and 1957 , and the ministerial system was introduced . Voting took place for the first time on the basis of universal adult suffrage on 9 March 1959 . The general election was again won by the Labour Party , led this time by Sir Seewoosagur Ramgoolam .
A Constitutional Review Conference was held in London in 1961 , and a programme of further constitutional advance was established . The 1963 election was won by the Labour Party and its allies . The Colonial Office noted that politics of a communal nature was gaining ground in Mauritius and that the choice of candidates ( by parties ) and the voting behaviour ( of electors ) were governed by ethnic and caste considerations . Around that time , two eminent British academics , Richard Titmuss and James Meade , published a report of the island 's social problems caused by overpopulation and the monoculture of sugar cane . This led to an intense campaign to halt the population explosion , and the decade registered a sharp decline in population growth .
In early 1965 a political assassination took place in the suburb of Belle-Rose in the town of Quatre Bornes when Labour activist Rampersad Surath was beaten to death by thugs of rival party Parti Mauricien . On 10 May 1965 1965 Mauritius race riots broke out in the village of Trois Boutiques near Souillac , Mauritius and progressed to the historic village of Mahebourg . A nationwide State of Emergency was declared on the British colony . The riot was initiated by the murder of Police Constable Beesoo in his vehicle by a Creole gang . This was followed by the murder of a civilian named Mr. Robert Brousse in Trois Boutiques . The Creole gang then proceeded to the coastal historic village of Mahebourg to assault the Indo-Mauritian spectators who were watching a Hindustani movie at Cinma Odon . Mahebourg police recorded nearly 100 complaints of assaults on Indo-Mauritians .
===Independence ( since 1968 ) ===
At the Lancaster Conference of 1965 , it became clear that Britain wanted to relieve itself of the colony of Mauritius . In 1959 , Harold Macmillan had made his famous Wind of Change ( speech ) where he acknowledged that the best option for Britain was to give complete independence to its colonies . Thus , since the late Fifties , the way was paved for independence .
Later in 1965 , after the Lancaster Conference , the Chagos Archipelago was excised from the territory of Mauritius to form the British Indian Ocean Territory ( BIOT ) . A general election took place on 7 August 1967 , and the Independence Party ( Mauritius ) obtained the majority of seats . In January 1968 , six weeks before the declaration of independence the 1968 Mauritian riots occurred in Port Louis leading to the deaths of 25 people .
Mauritius adopted a new constitution and independence was proclaimed on 12 March 1968 . Sir Seewoosagur Ramgoolam became the first prime minister of an independent Mauritius with Queen Elizabeth II remaining head of state as Queen of Mauritius . In 1969 , the opposition party Mauritian Militant Movement ( MMM ) led by Paul Brenger was founded . Later in 1971 , the MMM , backed by unions , called a series of strikes in the port , which caused a state of emergency in the country . The coalition government of the Labour Party and the PMSD ( Parti Mauricien Social Dmocrate ) reacted by curtailing civil liberties and curbing freedom of the press . Two unsuccessful assassination attempts were made against Paul Brenger . On 1 October 1971 his supporter Fareed Muttur died in suspicious circumstances at Le Rduit whilst driving Paul Brenger 's car . The second led to the death of Azor Adelaide , a dock worker and activist , on 25 November 1971 . General elections were postponed and public meetings were prohibited . Members of the MMM including Paul Brenger were imprisoned on 23 December 1971 . The MMM leader was released a year later .
In May 1975 , a student revolt that started at the University of Mauritius swept across the country . The students were unsatisfied with an education system that did not meet their aspirations and gave limited prospects for future employment . On 20 May , thousands of students tried to enter Port-Louis over the Grand River North West bridge and clashed with police . An act of Parliament was passed on 16 December 1975 to extend the right to vote to 18-year-olds . This was seen as an attempt to appease the frustration of the younger generation .
The next general elections took place on 1976 Mauritian general election . The Labour-CAM coalition won only 28 seats out of 62 . The MMM secured 34 seats in Parliament but outgoing Prime Minister Sir Seewoosagur Ramgoolam managed to remain in office , with a two-seat majority , after striking an alliance with the PMSD of Gaetan Duval .
In 1982 an Mauritian Militant Movement-Parti Socialiste Mauricien government ( led by List of prime ministers of Mauritius Anerood Jugnauth , Deputy Prime Minister of Mauritius Harish Boodhoo and Finance Minister Paul Brenger ) was elected . However , ideological and personality differences emerged within the MMM and PSM leadership . The power struggle between Brenger and Jugnauth peaked in March 1983 . Jugnauth travelled to New Delhi to attend a Non-Aligned Movement summit ; on his return , Brenger proposed constitutional changes that would strip power from the Prime Minister . At Jugnauth 's request , PM Indira Gandhi of India planned an armed intervention involving the Indian Navy and Indian Army to prevent a coup under the code name Operation Lal Dora .
The Mauritian Militant Movement-Parti Socialiste Mauricien government split up nine months after the June 1982 election . According to an Information Ministry official the nine months was a `` socialist experiment '' . Harish Boodhoo dissolved his party Parti Socialiste Mauricien to enable all PSM parliamentarians to join Jugnauth 's new party MSM , thus remaining in power whilst distancing themselves from Mauritian Militant Movement . The MSM-Labour-PMSD coalition was victorious at the 1983 Mauritian general election elections , resulting in Anerood Jugnauth as PM and Gatan Duval as Deputy Prime Minister of Mauritius .
That period saw growth in the EPZ ( Export Processing Zone ) sector . Industrialisation began to spread to villages as well , and attracted young workers from all ethnic communities . As a result , the sugar industry began to lose its hold on the economy . Large retail chains began opening stores in 1985 and offered credit facilities to low-income earners , thus allowing them to afford basic household appliances . There was also a boom in the tourism industry , and new hotels sprang up throughout the island . In 1989 the stock exchange opened its doors and in 1992 the freeport began operation . In 1990 , the List of prime ministers of Mauritius lost the vote on changing the Constitution to make the country a republic with Brenger as President .
===Republic ( since 1992 ) ===
On 12 March 1992 , twenty-four years after independence , Mauritius was proclaimed a republic within the Commonwealth of Nations . The last governor general , Veerasamy Ringadoo , became the first President of Mauritius . This was under a transitional arrangement , in which he was replaced by Cassam Uteem later that year . Political power remained with the prime minister .
Despite an improvement in the economy , which coincided with a fall in the price of petrol and a favourable dollar exchange rate , the government did not enjoy full popularity . As early as 1984 , there was discontent . Through the Newspapers and Periodicals Amendment Act , the government tried to make every newspaper provide a bank guarantee of half a million rupees . Forty-three journalists protested by participating in a public demonstration in Port Louis , in front of Parliament . They were arrested and freed on bail . This caused a public outcry and the government had to review its policy .
There was also dissatisfaction in the education sector . There were not enough high-quality secondary colleges to answer the growing demand of primary school leavers who had got through their CPE ( Certificate of Primary Education ) . In 1991 , a master plan for education failed to get national support and contributed to the government 's downfall .
In December 1995 Navin Ramgoolam was elected as List of prime ministers of Mauritius of the Labour-MMM alliance . In October 1996 the triple murder of political activists at Gorah-Issac Street in Port Louis led to several arrests and a long investigation . The year 1999 was marked by civil unrest and riots in 1999 Mauritian riots and then in 1999 L'Amicale riots . Following the Kaya riots President Cassam Uteem and Cardinal Jean Margot toured the country and calm was restored after four days of turmoil . A commission of enquiry was set up to investigate the root causes of the social disturbance . The resulting report delved into the cause of poverty and qualified many tenacious beliefs as perceptions . In January 2000 political activist Rajen Sabapathee was shot dead after he escaped from La Bastille jail .
Anerood Jugnauth of the MSM returned to power in September 2000 after securing an alliance with the MMM . In 2002 , the island of Rodrigues became an autonomous entity within the republic and was thus able to elect its own representatives to administer the island . In 2003 , the List of prime ministers of Mauritius was transferred to Paul Brenger of the MMM , and Anerood Jugnauth became president . Brenger was the first Franco-Mauritian Prime Minister in the country 's post-Independence history .
In 2005 , Navin Ramgoolam became PM under the new coalition of Labour-PMXD-VF-MR-MMSM . In 2010 the Labour-MSM-PMSD alliance secured power and Navin Ramgoolam remained PM until 2014.
The MSM-PMSD-ML coalition was victorious at the 2014 elections under Anerood Jugnauth 's leadership . Despite disagreements within the ruling alliance which led to the departure of PMSD , the MSM-ML stayed in power for their full 5-year term .
On 21 January 2017 Anerood Jugnauth announced his resignation and that his son and Finance Minister Pravind Jugnauth would assume the office of prime minister . The transition took place as planned on 23 January 2017.
In 2018 , Mauritian president Ameenah Gurib-Fakim ( the only former female head of state in the African Union ) resigned over a financial scandal . The incumbent president is Prithvirajsing Roopun who has served since December 2019.
On 25 July 2020 , Japanese-owned bulk carrier MV Wakashio ran aground on a coral reef off the coast of Mauritius , leaking up to 1,000 tonnes of heavy oil into a pristine lagoon . Its location on the edge of protected fragile marine ecosystems and a wetland of international importance made the MV Wakashio oil spill one of the worst environmental disasters ever to hit the western Indian Ocean .
==Geography==
The total land area of the country is . It is the List of countries and outlying territories by total area in the world by size . The Republic of Mauritius is constituted of Mauritius Island and Outer Islands of Mauritius . The nation 's exclusive economic zone ( EEZ ) covers about of the Indian Ocean , including approximately jointly managed with the Seychelles .
===Mauritius Island===
Mauritius is off the southeast coast of Africa , between latitudes 19th parallel south 1958.8 'S and 20th parallel south 2031.7 'S and longitudes 57th meridian east 5718.0 ' E and 57th meridian east 5746.5 ' E . It is long and wide . Its land area is . The island is surrounded by more than of white sandy beaches , and the lagoons are protected from the open sea by the world 's third-largest coral reef , which surrounds the island . Just off the Mauritian coast lie some 49 uninhabited islands and Islets of Mauritius , several of which have been declared natural reserves for endangered species .
The Mauritius Island ( Mauritian Creole : Isle Moris ; le Maurice , ) is relatively young geologically , having been created by volcanic activity some 8 million years ago . Together with Saint Brandon , Runion , and Rodrigues , the island is part of the Mascarene Islands . These islands emerged as a result of gigantic underwater volcanic eruptions that happened thousands of kilometres to the east of the continental block made up of Africa and Madagascar . They are no longer volcanically active and the Runion hotspot now rests under Runion Island . Mauritius is encircled by a broken ring of mountain ranges , varying in height from above sea level . The land rises from coastal plains to a central plateau where it reaches a height of ; the highest peak is in the south-west , Piton de la Petite Rivire Noire at . Streams and rivers speckle the island , many formed in the cracks created by lava flows .
===Rodrigues Island===
The autonomous island of Rodrigues is located to the east of Mauritius , with an area . Rodrigues is a volcanic island rising from a ridge along the edge of the Mascarene Plateau . The island is hilly with a central spine culminating in the highest peak , Mountain Limon at . The island also has a coral reef and extensive limestone deposits . According to Statistics Mauritius , at 1 July 2019 , the population of the island was estimated at 43,371.
===Chagos Archipelago===
The Chagos Archipelago is composed of atolls and islands , and is located approximately 2,200 kilometres north-east of the main island of Mauritius . To the north of the Chagos Archipelago are Peros Banhos , the Salomon Islands and Nelsons Island ; to the south-west are Three Brothers , Chagos , Eagle Islands , Egmont Islands and Danger Island , Great Chagos Bank . Diego Garcia is in the south-east of the Archipelago . In 2016 , the Chagossian population was estimated at 8,700 in Mauritius , including 483 natives ; 350 Chagossians live in the Seychelles , including 75 natives , while 3,000 , including 127 natives , live in the UK ( the population having grown from the 1200 Chagossians who moved there ) .
===St . Brandon===
St. Brandon , also known as Cargados Carajos Shoals , is located northeast of Mauritius Island . The archipelago consists of 16 Islands and Islets . Saint Brandon consists of five island groups , with about 2840 islands and islets in total , depending on seasonal storms and related sand movements .
===Agalga Islands===
The twin islands of Agalga are located some to the north of Mauritius . Its North Island is long and wide , while its South Island is . The total area of both islands is . According to Statistics Mauritius , at 1 July 2019 , the population of Agalga and St. Brandon was estimated at 274.
===Tromelin===
Tromelin island lies 430 ; km north-west of Mauritius . Mauritius claims sovereignty over Tromelin Island , as does France .
The French took control of Mauritius in 1715 , renaming it Isle de France ( Mauritius ) . France officially ceded Mauritius including all its dependencies to Britain through the Treaty of Paris ( 1814 ) , signed on 30 May 1814 and in which Runion was returned to France . The British Mauritius consisted of the main island of Mauritius along with its dependencies Rodrigues , Agalega , St Brandon , Tromelin ( disputed ) and the Chagos Archipelago , while the Seychelles became a separate colony in 1906 . It is disputed whether the transfer of Isle de France ( As Mauritius was previously known under French rule ) and its dependencies to Britain in 1814 included Tromelin island . Article 8 of the Treaty of Paris stipulate the cession by France to Britain of Isle de France `` and its dependencies , namely Rodrigues and the Seychelles '' . France considers that the sovereignty of Tromelin island was never transferred to Britain . Mauritius claims is based on the fact that the transfer of Isle de France and its dependencies to Britain in 1814 was general , it was beyond those called  namely  in the Treaty of Paris , all the dependencies of Isle de France were not specifically mentioned in the Treaty . Mauritius claim that since Tromelin was a dependency of Isle de France , it was 'de facto ' transferred to Britain in 1814 . In addition , the islands of Rodrigues , Agalega , St Brandon and the Chagos Archipelago were also not specifically mentioned in the Treaty of Paris but became part of the British Colony of Mauritius as they were dependencies of Isle de France at that time . In addition , the British authorities in Mauritius have been taking administrative measures with respect to Tromelin over the years , for instance , British officials granted four guano operating concessions on Tromelin island between 1901 and 1951 . In 1959 , British officials in Mauritius informed the World Meteorological Organization that it considered Tromelin to be part of its territory . A co-management treaty was reached by France and Mauritius in 2010 but has not been ratified .
===Districts of Mauritius Island===
Mauritius is subdivided into nine Districts , they consist of different List of cities , towns and villages in Mauritius cities , towns and villages .
===Territorial disputes===
=== Chagos Archipelago ===
Mauritius has long sought sovereignty over the Chagos Archipelago , located to the north-east . Chagos was administratively part of Mauritius from the 18th century when the French first settled the islands . All of the islands forming part of the French colonial territory of Isle de France ( Mauritius ) ( as Mauritius was then known ) were ceded to the British in 1810 under the Act of Capitulation signed between the two powers . In 1965 , three years before the independence of Mauritius , the United Kingdom split the Chagos Archipelago from Mauritius and the islands of Aldabra , Farquhar Group and Desroches from the Seychelles to form the British Indian Ocean Territory ( BIOT ) . The islands were formally established as an overseas territory of the United Kingdom on 8 November 1965 . On 23 June 1976 , Aldabra , Farquhar and Desroches were returned to Seychelles as a result of its attaining independence . The BIOT now comprises the Chagos Archipelago only . The UK leased the main island of the archipelago , Diego Garcia , to the United States under a 50-year lease to establish a military base . In 2016 , Britain unilaterally extended the lease to the US till 2036 . Mauritius has repeatedly asserted that the separation of its territories is a violation of United Nations resolutions banning the dismemberment of colonial territories before independence and claims that the Chagos Archipelago , including Diego Garcia , forms an integral part of the territory of Mauritius under both Mauritian law and international law . After initially denying that the islands were inhabited , British officials forcibly expelled to the mainland approximately 2,000 Chagossians who had lived on those islands for a century . To force the inhabitants to leave , first the British authorities cut off food supplies , and those who resisted were threatened with being shot or bombed if they did not leave the island . To frighten them , their dogs and pets were gassed to death . At the United Nations and in statements to its Parliament , the UK stated that there was no `` permanent population '' in the Chagos Archipelago and described the population as `` contract labourers '' who were relocated . Since 1971 , only the atoll of Diego Garcia is inhabited , home to some 3,000 UK and US military and civilian contracted personnel . Chagossians have since engaged in activism to return to the archipelago , claiming that their forced expulsion and dispossession were illegal .
Section 111 of the Constitution of Mauritius states that  Mauritius  includes
( a ) the Islands of Mauritius , Rodrigues , Agalega , Tromelin , Cargados Carajos and the Chagos Archipelago , including Diego Garcia and any other island comprised in the State of Mauritius ;
( b ) the territorial sea and the air space above the territorial sea and the islands specified in paragraph ( a ) ;
( c ) the continental shelf ; and
( d ) such places or areas as may be designated by regulations made by the Prime Minister , rights over which are or may become exercisable by Mauritius .
Mauritius considers the territorial sea of the Chagos Archipelago and Tromelin island as part of its Exclusive Economic Zone .
==== Permanent Court of Arbitration ====
On 20 December 2010 , Mauritius initiated proceedings against the United Kingdom under the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea ( UNCLOS ) to challenge the legality of the Chagos Marine Protected Area ( MPA ) , which the UK purported to declare around the Chagos Archipelago in April 2010 . The dispute was arbitrated by the Permanent Court of Arbitration .
The sovereignty of Mauritius was explicitly recognized by two of the arbitrators and denied by none of the other three . Three members of the Tribunal found that they did not have jurisdiction to rule on that question ; they expressed no view as to which of the two States has sovereignty over the Chagos Archipelago . Tribunal Judges Rdiger Wolfrum and James Kateka held that the Tribunal did have jurisdiction to decide this question , and concluded that UK does not have sovereignty over the Chagos Archipelago . They found that :
* internal United Kingdom documents suggested an ulterior motive behind the MPA , noting disturbing similarities and a common pattern between the establishment of the so-called `` BIOT '' in 1965 and the proclamation of the MPA in 2010 ;
* the excision of the Chagos Archipelago from Mauritius in 1965 shows a complete disregard for the territorial integrity of Mauritius by the UK ;
* UK Prime Minister Harold Wilson 's threat to Premier Sir Seewoosagur Ramgoolam in 1965 that he could return home without independence if he did not consent to the excision of the Chagos Archipelago amounted to duress ; Mauritian Ministers were coerced into agreeing to the detachment of the Chagos Archipelago , which violated the international law of self-determination ;
* the MPA is legally invalid .
The Tribunal 's decision determined that the UK 's undertaking to return the Chagos Archipelago to Mauritius gives Mauritius an interest in significant decisions that bear upon possible future uses of the Archipelago . The result of the Tribunal 's decision is that it is now open to the Parties to enter into the negotiations that the Tribunal would have expected prior to the proclamation of the MPA , with a view to achieving a mutually satisfactory arrangement for protecting the marine environment , to the extent necessary under a `` sovereignty umbrella '' .
==== International Court of Justice ====
=====Amendment of exclusion clause by UK=====
In 2004 , following the decision of the British government to promulgate the British Indian Ocean Territory Order , which prohibited the Chagossians from remaining on the islands without express authorisation , Mauritius contemplated recourse to the International Court of Justice to finally and conclusively settle the dispute . However , article 36 of the International Court of Justice Statute provides that it is the option of the state whether it wishes to subject itself to the court 's jurisdiction . Where the state chooses to be so bound , it may also restrict or limit the jurisdiction of the court in a number of ways . The UK 's clause deposited at the court excluded , amongst other things , the jurisdiction of the court with regard `` to any disputes with the government of any country which is a member of the Commonwealth with regard to situations or facts existing before 1 January 1969 '' . The temporal limitation of 1 January 1969 was inserted to exclude all disputes arising during decolonisation . The effect of the British exclusionary clause would thus have prevented Mauritius from resorting to the court on the Chagos dispute because it is a member of the Commonwealth of Nations . When Mauritius threatened to leave the Commonwealth , the United Kingdom quickly amended its exclusion clause to exclude any disputes between itself , Commonwealth States and former Commonwealth States , thereby quashing any Mauritian hopes to ever have recourse to the contentious jurisdiction of the court , even if it left .
=====Advisory opinion=====
On 22 June 2017 , by a margin of 94 to 15 countries , the UN General Assembly asked the International Court of Justice to give an advisory opinion on the separation of the Chagos Archipelago from Mauritius before the country 's independence in the 1960s . In September 2018 , the International Court of Justice began hearings on the case . 17 countries have argued in favour of Mauritius . The UK apologised for the `` shameful '' way islanders were evicted from the Chagos Archipelago but were insistent that Mauritius was wrong to bring the dispute over sovereignty of the strategic atoll group to the United Nations  highest court . The UK and its allies argued that this matter should not be decided by the court but should be resolved through bilateral negotiations , while bilateral discussions with Mauritius have been unfruitful over the past 50 years .
On 25 February 2019 , the judges of the International Court of Justice by thirteen votes to one stated that the United Kingdom is under an obligation to bring to an end its administration of the Chagos Archipelago as rapidly as possible . Only the American judge , Joan Donoghue , voted in favor of the UK . The president of the court , Abdulqawi Ahmed Yusuf , said the detachment of the Chagos Archipelago in 1965 from Mauritius had not been based on a `` free and genuine expression of the people concerned . '' `` This continued administration constitutes a wrongful act , '' he said , adding `` The UK has an obligation to bring to an end its administration of the Chagos Archipelago as rapidly as possible and that all member states must co-operate with the United Nations to complete the decolonization of Mauritius . ''
On 1 May 2019 , the UK Foreign Office minister Alan Duncan stated that Mauritius has never held sovereignty over the archipelago and the UK does not recognise its claim . He stated that the ruling was merely an advisory opinion and not a legally binding judgment . Jeremy Corbyn , leader of the UK 's main opposition party , wrote to the UK PM condemning her decision to defy a ruling of the UN 's principal court that concluded that Britain should hand back the Chagos Islands to Mauritius . He expressed his concern that the UK government appears ready to disregard international law and ignore a ruling of the international court and the right of the Chagossians to return to their homes .
On 22 May 2019 , the United Nations General Assembly debated and adopted a resolution that affirmed that the Chagos Archipelago , which has been occupied by the UK for more than 50 years , `` forms an integral part of the territory of Mauritius '' . The resolution gives effect to an advisory opinion of the International Court of Justice ( ICJ ) , demanded that the UK `` withdraw its colonial administration ... unconditionally within a period of no more than six months '' . 116 states voted in favour of the resolution , 55 abstained and only Australia , Hungary , Israel and Maldives supported the UK and US . During the debate , the Mauritian Prime Minister described the expulsion of Chagossians as `` a Crimes against humanity '' . While the resolution is not legally binding , it carries significant political weight since the ruling came from the UN 's highest court and the assembly vote reflects world opinion . The resolution also has immediate practical consequences : the UN , its specialised agencies , and all other international organisations are now bound , as a matter of UN law , to support the decolonisation of Mauritius even if the UK claim that it has no doubt about its sovereignty .
===Biodiversity===
The country is home to some of the world 's rarest plants and animals , but human habitation and the introduction of non-native species have threatened its indigenous flora and fauna . Due to its volcanic origin , age , isolation , and unique terrain , Mauritius is home to a diversity of flora and fauna not usually found in such a small area . Before the Portuguese arrival in 1507 , there were no terrestrial mammals on the island . This allowed the evolution of a number of flightless birds and large reptile species . The arrival of humans saw the introduction of invasive alien species , the rapid destruction of habitat and the loss of much of the endemic flora and fauna . Less than 2 % of the Forest now remains , concentrated in the Black River Gorges National Park in the south-west , the Bambous Mountain Range in the south-east , and the Moka-Port Louis Ranges in the north-west . There are some isolated mountains , Corps de Garde , Le Morne Brabant , and several Islets of Mauritius , with remnants of coastal and mainland diversity . Over 100 species of plants and animals have become extinct and many more are threatened . Conservation activities began in the 1980s with the implementation of programmes for the reproduction of threatened bird and plant species as well as habitat restoration in the national parks and nature reserves .
In 2011 , the Ministry of Environment & Sustainable Development issued the `` Mauritius Environment Outlook Report , '' which recommended that St Brandon be declared a Marine Protected Area .
In the President 's Report of the Mauritian Wildlife Foundation dated March 2016 , St Brandon is declared an official MWF project in order to promote the conservation of the atoll .
The Mauritian flying fox is the only remaining mammal endemic to the island , and has been severely threatened in recent years due to the government sanctioned culling introduced in November 2015 due to the belief that they were a threat to fruit plantations . Prior to 2015 the lack of severe cyclone had seen the fruit bat population increase and the status of the species was then changed by the International Union for Conservation of Nature from Endangered to Vulnerable in 2014 . October 2018 , saw the authorisation of the cull of 20 % of the fruit bat population , amounting to 13,000 of the estimated 65,000 fruit bats remaining , although their status had already reverted to Endangered due to the previous years ' culls .
=== The Dodo ===
When it was discovered , Mauritius was the home of a previously unknown species of bird , the dodo , descendants of a type of pigeon which settled in Mauritius over four million years ago . With no predators to attack them , they had lost their ability to fly . The Portuguese discovered the island around 1505 and the island quickly became a stopover for ships engaged in the spice trade . Weighing up to , the dodo was a welcome source of fresh meat for the sailors . Large numbers of dodos were killed for food . Later , when the Dutch used the island as a penal colony , new species were introduced to the island . Rats , pigs , and monkeys ate dodo eggs in the ground nests . The combination of human exploitation and introduced species significantly reduced the dodo population . Within 100 years of the arrival of humans on Mauritius , the once abundant dodo became a rare bird . The last one was killed in 1681 . The dodo is prominently featured as a ( heraldic ) supporter of the national coat of arms of Mauritius .
===Environment and climate===
The environment in Mauritius is typically tropical in the coastal regions with forests in the mountainous areas . Seasonal cyclones are destructive to its flora and fauna , although they recover quickly . Mauritius ranked second in an air quality index released by the World Health Organization in 2011 . It had a 2019 Forest Landscape Integrity Index mean score of 5.46/10 , ranking it 100th globally out of 172 countries .
Situated near the Tropic of Capricorn , Mauritius has a tropical climate . There are 2 seasons : a warm humid summer from November to April , with a mean temperature of and a relatively cool dry winter from June to September with a mean temperature of . The temperature difference between the seasons is only 4.3C ( 7.7F ) .

== History ==
===Antiquity===
During the Ubaid period ( 6500 BC ) , northern Kuwait was the central site of interaction between the peoples of Mesopotamia and Neolithic Eastern Arabia , mainly centered in Bahra 1 As-Subiya in northern Kuwait . The earliest evidence of human habitation in Kuwait dates back 8000 B.C . where Mesolithic tools were found in Burgan .
Mesopotamians first settled in the Kuwaiti island of Failaka Island in 2000 B.C . Traders from the Sumerian city of Ur inhabited Failaka and ran a mercantile business . The island had many Mesopotamian-style buildings typical of those found in Iraq dating from around 2000 B.C . The Neolithic inhabitants of Kuwait were among the world 's earliest maritime traders . One of the world 's earliest reed-boats was discovered in northern Kuwait dating back to the Ubaid period .
In 4000 BC until 2000 BC , the bay of Kuwait was home to the Dilmun civilization . Dilmun 's control of the bay of Kuwait included Kuwait City 's Shuwaikh Port ( formerly Akkaz Island ) , Umm an Namil Island and Failaka Island . At its peak in 2000 BC , the Dilmun empire controlled the trade routes from Mesopotamia to India and the Indus Valley civilization . Dilmun 's commercial power began to decline after 1800 BC . Piracy flourished throughout the region during Dilmun 's decline . After 600 BC , the Babylonians added Dilmun to their empire .
During the Dilmun era ( from ca . 3000 BC ) , Failaka was known as `` Agarum '' , the land of Enzak , a great god in the Dilmun civilization according to Sumerian cuneiform texts found on the island . As part of Dilmun , Failaka became a hub for the civilization from the end of the 3rd to the middle of the 1st millennium BC . Failaka was settled following 2000 BC after a drop in sea level . After the Dilmun civilization , Failaka was inhabited by the Kassites of Mesopotamia , and was formally under the control of the Kassites # Kassite Dynasty of Babylon . Studies indicate traces of human settlement can be found on Failaka dating back to as early as the end of the 3rd millennium BC , and extending until the 20th century AD . Many of the artifacts found in Falaika are linked to Mesopotamian civilizations and seem to show that Failaka was gradually drawn toward the civilization based in Antioch . Under Nebuchadnezzar II , Failaka was under Babylonian control . Cuneiform documents found in Failaka indicate the presence of Babylonians in the island 's population . List of Kings of Babylon were present in Failaka during the Neo-Babylonian Empire period , Nabonidus had a governor in Failaka and Nebuchadnezzar II had a palace and temple in Falaika . Failaka also contained temples dedicated to the worship of Shamash , the Mesopotamian sun god in the Babylonian pantheon .
In 4th century BC , the ancient Greeks colonized the bay of Kuwait under Alexander the Great , the ancient Greeks named mainland Kuwait Larissa and Failaka was named Ikaros ( Failaka Island ) . According to Strabo and Arrian , Alexander the Great named Failaka Ikaros because it resembled the Aegean island of that name in size and shape . Some elements of Greek mythology were mixed with the local cults in Failaka . `` Ikaros '' was also the name of a prominent city situated in Failaka . Remains of Greek colonization include a large Hellenistic Towns of ancient Greece # Military settlements and Greek temples .
In 127 BC , the kingdom of Characene was established around the Bay of Kuwait . Characene was centered in the region encompassing southern Mesopotamia , including Failaka island . A busy Parthian commercial station existed on Failaka island .
The earliest recorded mention of Kuwait was in 150 AD in the geographical treatise Geography ( Ptolemy ) by Greek scholar Ptolemy . Ptolemy mentioned the Bay of Kuwait as Hieros Kolpos ( Sacer Sinus in the Latin versions ) .
In 224 AD , Kuwait became part of the Sassanid Empire . At the time of the Sassanid Empire , Kuwait was known as Meshan , which was an alternative name of the kingdom of Characene . Akkaz was a Parthian Empire-Sassanian site ; the Zoroastrianism 's tower of silence was discovered in northern Akkaz .
In addition to Parthian Empire-Sasanian settlements , Akkaz also contained Christian settlements . Christians Nestorian settlements flourished in Akkaz and Failaka from the 5th century until the 9th century . Excavations have revealed several farms , villages and two large churches dating from the 5th and 6th century . Archaeologists are currently excavating nearby sites to understand the extent of the settlements that flourished in the eighth and ninth centuries A.D. An old island tradition is that a community grew up around a Christian mystic and hermit . The small farms and villages were eventually abandoned . Remains of Byzantine era Nestorian churches were found at Al-Qusur in Failaka . Pottery at the site can be dated from as early as the first half of the 7th century through the 9th century .
In 636 AD , the Battle of Chains between the Sassanid Empire and Rashidun Caliphate was fought in Kuwait near the town of Kazma . At the time , Kuwait was under the control of the Sassanid Empire . The Battle of Chains was the first battle of the Rashidun Caliphate in which the Muslim army sought to extend its frontiers .
As a result of Rashidun victory in 636 AD , the bay of Kuwait was home to the city of Kazma ( also known as `` Kadhima '' or `` Kzimah '' ) in the early Islamic era . Medieval Arabic sources contain multiple references to the bay of Kuwait in the early Islamic period . The city functioned as a port city and resting place for pilgrims on their way from Iraq to Hejaz . The city was controlled by the kingdom of Al-Hirah in Iraq . In the early Islamic period , the bay of Kuwait was known for being a fertile area .
The Kazma was a stop for caravans coming from Persia and Mesopotamia en route to the Arabian Peninsula . The poet Al-Farazdaq was born in the Kuwaiti city of Kazma . Al-Farazdaq is recognized as one of the greatest classical literature of the Arabs .
===1521 - 1918 : Founding===
In 1521 , Kuwait was under Portugal control . In the late 16th century , the Portuguese built a defensive settlement in Kuwait . In 1613 , Kuwait City was founded as a fishing village predominantly populated by fishermen . Administratively , it was a sheikhdom , ruled by local Sheikh from Bani Khalid clan . In 1682 or 1716 , the Bani Utbah settled in Kuwait City , which at this time was still inhabited by Fisherman and primarily functioned as a fishing village under Bani Khalid control . Sometime after the death of the Bani Khalid 's leader Barrak Bin Urair and the fall of the Bani Khalid Emirate , the Utub were able to wrest control of Kuwait as a result of successive Marriage of state .
In the early eighteenth century , Kuwait prospered as a maritime port city and rapidly became the principal commercial center for the transit of goods between Baghdad , India , Muscat , and Arabian Peninsula . By the mid 1700s , Kuwait had established itself as the major trading route from the Persian Gulf to Aleppo . During the OttomanPersian War ( 17751776 ) Persian siege of Basra in 177579 , Iraqi merchants took refuge in Kuwait and were partly instrumental in the expansion of Kuwait 's boat-building and trading activities . As a result , Kuwait 's maritime commerce boomed , as the Indian trade routes with Baghdad , Aleppo , Smyrna and Constantinople were diverted to Kuwait during this time . The East India Company was diverted to Kuwait in 1792 . The East India Company secured the sea routes between Kuwait , India and the east coasts of Africa . After the Persians withdrew from Basra in 1779 , Kuwait continued to attract trade away from Basra . The flight of many of Basra 's leading merchants to Kuwait continued to play a significant role in Basra 's commercial stagnation well into the 1850s .
Instability in Basra helped foster economic prosperity in Kuwait . In the late 18th century , Kuwait was a haven for Basra merchants fleeing Ottoman government persecution . Kuwait was the center of boat building in the Persian Gulf , its ships renowned throughout the Indian Ocean . Kuwaitis also developed a reputation as the best sailors in the Persian Gulf .

This gave Britain exclusive access and trade with Kuwait , while denying Ottoman provinces to the north a port on the Persian Gulf . The Sheikhdom of Kuwait remained a British protectorate until 1961.
During the Mubarak Al-Sabah , Kuwait was dubbed the `` Marseilles of the Persian Gulf '' because its economic vitality attracted a large variety of people . The population was cosmopolitan and ethnically diverse , including Arabs , Persians , Africans , History of the Jews in Kuwait and Armenians in Kuwait # History . Kuwait was known for its religious tolerance .
In the first decades of the twentieth century , Kuwait had a well-established elite : wealthy trading families linked by marriage and shared economic interests , long-settled and urban , most claiming descent from the original 30 Bani Utubi families . The wealthiest were merchants who acquired their wealth from long-distance commerce , shipbuilding and pearling .

===1919 - 1939 : After World War I===
In 1919 , Sheikh Salim Al-Mubarak Al-Sabah intended to build a commercial city in the south of Kuwait . This caused a diplomatic crisis with Najd , but Britain intervened , discouraging Sheikh Salim . In 1920 , an attempt by the Ikhwan to build a stronghold in southern Kuwait led to the Battle of Hamdh . The Battle of Hamdh involved 2,000 Ikhwan fighters against 100 Kuwaiti cavalrymen and 200 Kuwaiti infantrymen . The battle lasted for six days and resulted in heavy but unknown casualties on both sides resulting in the victory of the Ikhwan forces and leading to the battle of Jahra around the Kuwait Red Fort . The Battle of Jahra happened as the result of the Battle of Hamdh . A force of three to four thousand Ikhwan , led by Faisal Al-Dawish , attacked the Kuwait Red Fort at Al-Jahra , defended by fifteen hundred men . The fort was besieged and the Kuwaiti position precarious ; had the fort fallen , Kuwait would likely have been incorporated into Ibn Saud 's empire . The Ikhwan attack repulsed for the while , negotiations began between Salim and Al-Dawish ; the latter threatened another attack if the Kuwaiti forces did not surrender . The local merchant class convinced Salim to call in help from British troops , who showed up with airplanes and three warships , ending the attacks . After the Battle of Jahra , Ibn Saud 's warriors , the Ikhwan , demanded that Kuwait follows five rules : evict all the Shias , adopt the Wahhabism , label the Turks `` [ abolish smoking , Munkar ( disambiguation ) munkar ] and prostitution , and destroy the American missionary hospital .

At the Uqair Protocol of 1922 in 1922 , the boundaries of Kuwait and Najd were set ; as a result of British interference , Kuwait had no representative at the Uqair Protocol of 1922 . After the Uqair conference , Kuwait was still subjected to a Saudi economic blockade and intermittent Saudi Raid ( military ) .
The Great Depression harmed Kuwait 's economy , starting in the late 1920s . International trading was one of Kuwait 's main sources of income before oil . Kuwaiti merchants were mostly intermediary merchants . As a result of the decline of European demand for goods from India and Africa , Kuwait 's economy suffered . The decline in international trade resulted in an increase in gold smuggling by Kuwaiti ships to India . Some Kuwaiti merchant families became rich from this smuggling . Kuwait 's pearl industry also collapsed as a result of the worldwide economic depression . At its height , Kuwait 's pearl industry had led the world 's luxury market , regularly sending out between 750 and 800 ships to meet the European elite 's desire for pearls . During the economic depression , luxuries like pearls were in little demand . The Japanese invention of Cultured pearl also contributed to the collapse of Kuwait 's pearl industry .
In 1937 , Freya Stark wrote about the extent of poverty in Kuwait at the time :
Some merchant families left Kuwait in the early 1930s due to the prevalence of economic hardship caused by Saudi Arabia 's economic blockade against Kuwait . At the time of the discovery of oil in 19361937 , most of Kuwait 's inhabitants were impoverished .
Throughout the 1930s , Kuwaiti people opposed the British imposed separation of Kuwait from Iraq . In 1938 , the `` Free Kuwaiti Movement '' was established by Kuwaiti youth who opposed British rule and submitted a petition demanding the Iraqi government reunifies Kuwait and Iraq . Due to fears of armed uprising in Kuwait , the Al Sabah agreed to the establishment of a legislative council to represent the `` Free Kuwaiti Movement '' demanding the reunification of Iraq and Kuwait . In 1938 , the council 's first meeting resulted in unanimous resolutions demanding the reunification of Kuwait and Iraq .
In March 1939 , a popular armed uprising erupted within Kuwait to reunify with Iraq . The Al Sabah family , along with British military support , violently put down the uprising , and killed and imprisoned its participants . King Ghazi of Iraq publicly demanded the release of the Kuwaiti prisoners and warned the Al Sabah family to end the repression of the `` Free Kuwaiti Movement '' .

According to the 2011 census , the two most spoken first languages are Zulu language ( 22.7 % ) and Xhosa language ( 16.0 % ) . The two next ones are of European origin : Afrikaans ( 13.5 % ) developed from Dutch language and serves as the first language of most coloured and White South African South Africans ; South African English ( 9.6 % ) reflects the legacy of British colonialism , and is commonly used in public and commercial life .

However , the vast majority of black South Africans were not enfranchised until 1994.
During the 20th century , the black majority sought to claim more rights from the dominant white minority , which played a large role in the country 's recent History of South Africa and politics . The National Party ( South Africa ) imposed apartheid in 1948 , institutionalising previous racial segregation . After a long and sometimes violent Internal resistance to apartheid by the African National Congress ( ANC ) and other anti-apartheid activists both inside and outside the country , the repeal of discriminatory laws began in the mid-1980s .

== History ==
=== Prehistoric archaeology ===
South Africa contains some of the oldest archaeological and [ fossil human-fossil ] sites in the world . Archaeologists have recovered extensive fossil remains from a series of caves in Gauteng Province . The area , a UNESCO World Heritage site , has been branded `` the Cradle of Humankind '' . The sites include Sterkfontein , one of the richest sites for [ fossils in the world . Other sites include Swartkrans ] , [ [ Gondolin Cave , Kromdraai , Coopers Cave and Malapa . Raymond Dart identified the first hominin fossil discovered in Africa , the Taung Child ( found near Taung ) in 1924 . Further hominin remains have come from the sites of Makapansgat in Limpopo Province , Cornelia , Free State and Florisbad in the Free State ( South African province ) , Border Cave in KwaZulu-Natal Province , Klasies River Mouth in Eastern Cape Province and Pinnacle Point , Elandsfontein cranium and Die Kelders Cave in Western Cape Province .
These finds suggest that various hominid species existed in South Africa from about three million years ago , starting with Australopithecus africanus . There followed species including Australopithecus sediba , Homo ergaster , Homo erectus , Homo rhodesiensis , Homo helmei , Homo naledi and modern humans ( Homo sapiens ) . Modern humans have Pinnacle Point for at least 170,000 years .
Various researchers have located pebble tools within the Vaal River valley .
=== Bantu expansion ===
Settlements of Bantu-speaking peoples of South Africa Bantu-speaking peoples , who were iron-using agriculturists and [ were already present south of the Limpopo River ] ( now the northern border with [ [ Botswana and Zimbabwe ) by the 4th or 5th century Current Era ( see Bantu expansion ) . They displaced , conquered and absorbed the original Khoisan speakers , the Khoikhoi and Bushmen peoples . The Bantu slowly moved south . The earliest ironworks in modern-day KwaZulu-Natal Province are believed to date from around 1050 . The southernmost group was the Xhosa people , whose language incorporates certain linguistic traits from the earlier Khoisan people . The Xhosa reached the Great Fish River , in today 's Eastern Cape Province . As they migrated , these larger Iron Age populations displaced or assimilated earlier peoples .
In Mpumalanga Province , several stone circles have been found along with the stone arrangement that has been named Adam 's Calendar , and the ruins are thought to be created by the Bokoni , a Northern Sotho language people .
=== Portuguese exploration ===
At the time of European contact , the dominant ethnic group were Bantu-speaking peoples who had migrated from other parts of Africa about one thousand years before . The two major historic groups were the Xhosa people and Zulu peoples .
In 1487 , the Portuguese explorer Bartolomeu Dias led the first European voyage to land in southern Africa . On 4 December , he landed at Walfisch Bay ( now known as Walvis Bay in present-day Namibia ) . This was south of the furthest point reached in 1485 by his predecessor , the Portuguese navigator Diogo Co ( Cape Cross , north of the bay ) . Dias continued down the western coast of southern Africa . After 8 January 1488 , prevented by storms from proceeding along the coast , he sailed out of sight of land and passed the southernmost point of Africa without seeing it . He reached as far up the eastern coast of Africa as , what he called , Rio do Infante , probably the present-day Groot River ( Eastern Cape ) , in May 1488 , but on his return he saw the Cape , which he first named Cabo das Tormentas ( Cape of Storms ) . His King , John II of Portugal , renamed the point Cabo da Boa Esperana , or Cape of Good Hope , as it led to the riches of the East Indies . Dias ' feat of navigation was later immortalised in Lus de Cames ' Portuguese epic poem , Os Lusadas ( 1572 ) .
=== Dutch colonisation ===
By the early 17th century , Portugal 's maritime power was starting to decline , and English and Dutch merchants competed to oust Lisbon from its lucrative monopoly on the spice trade . Representatives of the British East India Company did call sporadically at the Cape in search of provisions as early as 1601 , but later came to favour Ascension Island and St. Helena as alternative ports of refuge . Dutch interest was aroused after 1647 , when two employees of the Dutch East India Company ( Verenigde Oostindische Compagnie ) were shipwrecked at the Cape for several months . The sailors were able to survive by obtaining fresh water and meat from the natives . They also sowed vegetables in the fertile soil . Upon their return to Holland , they reported favourably on the Cape 's potential as a `` warehouse and garden '' for provisions to stock passing ships for long voyages .
In 1652 , a century and a half after the discovery of the Cape sea route , Jan van Riebeeck established a station at the Cape of Good Hope , at what would become Cape Town , on behalf of the Dutch East India Company . In time , the Cape became home to a large population of vrij , also known as vrijburgers ( ) , former company employees who stayed in Dutch territories overseas after serving their contracts . Dutch traders also imported thousands of slavery to the fledgling colony from Indonesia , Madagascar , and parts of eastern Africa . Some of the earliest mixed race communities in the country were formed through unions between vrijburgers , their slaves , and various indigenous peoples . This led to the development of a new ethnic group , the Cape Coloureds , most of whom adopted the Dutch language and Christian faith .
The eastward expansion of Dutch colonists ushered in a series of wars with the southwesterly migrating Xhosa tribe , known as the Xhosa Wars , as both sides competed for the pastureland necessary to graze their cattle near the Great Fish River . Vrijburgers who became independent farmers on the frontier were known as Boers , with some adopting semi-nomadic lifestyles being denoted as trekboers . The Boers formed loose militias , which they termed commandos , and forged alliances with Khoisan groups to repel Xhosa raids . Both sides launched bloody but inconclusive offensives , and sporadic violence , often accompanied by livestock theft , remained common for several decades .
===British colonisation and the Great Trek===
Great Britain occupied Cape Town between 1795 and 1803 to prevent it from falling under the control of the French First Republic , which had invaded the Low Countries . Despite briefly returning to Dutch rule under the Batavian Republic in 1803 , the Cape was occupied again by the British in 1806 . Following the end of the Napoleonic Wars , it was formally ceded to Great Britain and became an integral part of the British Empire . British emigration to South Africa began around 1818 , subsequently culminating in the arrival of the 1820 Settlers . The new colonists were induced to settle for a variety of reasons , namely to increase the size of the European workforce and to bolster frontier regions against Xhosa incursions .
In the first two decades of the 19th century , the Zulu people grew in power and expanded their territory under their leader , Shaka . Shaka 's warfare indirectly led to the Mfecane ( `` crushing '' ) , in which 1,000,000 to 2,000,000 people were killed and the inland plateau was devastated and depopulated in the early 1820s . An offshoot of the Zulu , the Northern Ndebele people people created a larger empire that included large parts of the [ under their king Mzilikazi ] .
During the early 1800s , many Dutch settlers departed from the [ [ Cape Colony , where they had been subjected to British control , in a series of migrant groups who came to be known as Voortrekkers , meaning `` Pathfinders '' or `` Pioneers '' . They migrated to the future Natal ( province ) , Free State , and Transvaal ( province ) regions . The Boers founded the Boer Republics : the South African Republic ( now Gauteng , Limpopo , Mpumalanga and North West Province ( South Africa ) provinces ) , the Natalia Republic ( KwaZulu-Natal ) , and the Orange Free State ( Free State ) .
The discovery of diamonds in 1867 and gold in 1884 in the interior started the Mineral Revolution and increased economic growth and immigration . This intensified British efforts to gain control over the indigenous peoples . The struggle to control these important economic resources was a factor in relations between Europeans and the indigenous population and also between the Boers and the British .
On 16 May 1876 , Thomas Franois Burgers of the South African Republic ( Transvaal Colony ) declared war against Sekhukhune and the Pedi people . Sekhukhune managed to defeat the Transvaal army on 1 August 1876 . Another attack by the Lydenburg Volunteer Corps was also repulsed . On 16 February 1877 , the two parties signed a peace treaty at Botshabelo , Mpumalanga . The Boers inability to subdue Sekhukhune and the Pedi led to the departure of Burgers in favour of Paul Kruger and the British annexation of the South African Republic ( Transvaal Colony ) on 12 April 1877 by Theophilus Shepstone , secretary for native affairs of Colony of Natal . In 1878 and 1879 three British attacks were successfully repelled until Garnet Wolseley , 1st Viscount Wolseley defeated Sekhukhune in November 1879 with an army of 2,000 British soldiers , Boers and 10,000 Swazis .
The Anglo-Zulu War was fought in 1879 between the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland and the Zulu Kingdom . Following Lord Carnarvon 's successful introduction of Canadian Confederation , it was thought that similar political effort , coupled with military campaigns , might succeed with the African kingdoms , tribal areas and Boer republics in South Africa . In 1874 , Sir Henry Bartle Frere was sent to South Africa as the British High Commissioner for Southern Africa to bring such plans into being . Among the obstacles were the presence of the independent states of the Boers and the Zulu Kingdom and its army . The Zulu nation defeated the British at the Battle of Isandlwana . Eventually , though , the war was lost , resulting in the termination of the Zulu nation 's independence .
===Boer Wars===
The Boer Republics successfully resisted British encroachments during the First Boer War ( 18801881 ) using guerrilla warfare tactics , which were well suited to local conditions . The British returned with greater numbers , more experience , and new strategy in the Second Boer War ( 18991902 ) but suffered heavy casualties through Attrition warfare ; nonetheless , they were ultimately successful . Over 27,000 Boer women and children died in the British concentration camps .
==== Independence ====
Within the country , anti-British policies among white South Africans focused on independence . During the Dutch and British colonial years , racial segregation was mostly informal , though some legislation was enacted to control the settlement and movement of native people , including the Native Location Act of 1879 and the system of pass laws .
Eight years after the end of the Second Boer War and after four years of negotiation , an act of the British Parliament ( South Africa Act 1909 ) granted nominal independence , while creating the Union of South Africa on 31 May 1910 . The Union was a dominion that included the former territories of the Cape Colony , Transvaal Colony and Colony of Natal colonies , as well as the Orange Free State republic .
The Natives ' Land Act of 1913 severely restricted the ownership of land by blacks ; at that stage natives controlled only seven percent of the country . The amount of land reserved for indigenous peoples was later marginally increased .
In 1931 , the union was fully sovereign from the United Kingdom with the passage of the Statute of Westminster 1931 , which abolished the last powers of the Parliament of the United Kingdom to legislate on the country . In 1934 , the South African Party and National Party ( South Africa ) merged to form the United Party ( South Africa ) , seeking reconciliation between Afrikaners and English-speaking whites . In 1939 , the party split over the entry of the Union into World War II as an Military history of South Africa during World War II , a move which the National Party followers strongly opposed .
==== Beginning of apartheid ====
In 1948 , the National Party was elected to power . It strengthened the racial segregation begun under Dutch and British colonial rule . Taking Canada 's Indian Act as a framework , the Nationalism government classified all peoples into three races and developed rights and limitations for each . The white minority ( less than 20 % ) controlled the vastly larger black majority . The legally institutionalised segregation became known as apartheid . While whites enjoyed the highest standard of living in all of Africa , comparable to First World Western nations , the black majority remained disadvantaged by almost every standard , including income , education , housing , and life expectancy . The Freedom Charter , adopted in 1955 by the Congress Alliance , demanded a non-racial society and an end to discrimination .
=== Republic ===
On 31 May 1961 , the country became a republic following South African republic referendum , 1960 ( only open to white voters ) which narrowly passed ; the British-dominated Natal Province province largely voted against the proposal . Queen Elizabeth II lost the title Queen of South Africa , and the last Governor-General of the Union of South Africa Governor-General , Charles Robberts Swart , became State President of South Africa . As a concession to the Westminster system , the appointment of the president remained an appointment by parliament , and virtually powerless until P. W. Botha 's South African Constitution of 1983 , which eliminated the office of Prime Minister of South Africa and instated a near-unique `` strong presidency '' Parliamentary system . Pressured by other Commonwealth of Nations countries , South Africa withdrew from the organisation in 1961 and rejoined it only in 1994.
Despite Internal resistance to apartheid both within and outside the country , the government legislated for a continuation of apartheid . The security forces cracked down on internal dissent , and violence became widespread , with anti-apartheid organisations such as the African National Congress ( ANC ) , the Azanian People 's Organisation ( AZAPO ) , and the Pan Africanist Congress of Azania Pan-Africanist Congress ( PAC ) carrying out guerrilla warfare and urban sabotage . The three rival resistance movements also engaged in occasional inter-factional clashes as they jockeyed for domestic influence . Apartheid became increasingly controversial , and several countries began to boycott business with the South African government because of its racial policies . These measures were later extended to international sanctions and the Disinvestment from South Africa by foreign investors .
In the late 1970s , South Africa South Africa and weapons of mass destruction . In the following decade , it produced six deliverable nuclear weapons .
==== End of apartheid ====
The Mahlabatini Declaration of Faith , signed by Mangosuthu Buthelezi and Harry Schwarz in 1974 , enshrined the principles of peaceful transition of power and equality for all , the first of such agreements by black and white political leaders in South Africa . Ultimately , F. W. de Klerk opened bilateral discussions with Nelson Mandela in 1993 for a transition of policies and government .
In 1990 , the National Party government took the first step towards dismantling discrimination when it lifted the ban on the ANC and other political organisations . It released Nelson Mandela from prison after 27 years ' serving a sentence for sabotage . A Negotiations to end apartheid in South Africa followed . With approval from the white electorate in a South African apartheid referendum , 1992 , the government continued negotiations to end apartheid . South Africa also destroyed its nuclear arsenal and acceded to the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty . South Africa held its first universal South African general election , 1994 , which the ANC won by an overwhelming majority . It has been in power ever since . The country rejoined the Commonwealth of Nations and became a member of the Southern African Development Community ( SADC ) .
In post-apartheid South Africa , unemployment remained high . While many blacks have risen to middle or upper classes , the overall unemployment rate of black people worsened between 1994 and 2003 by official metrics , but declined significantly using expanded definitions . Poverty among whites , which was previously rare , increased . In addition , the current government has struggled to achieve the monetary and fiscal discipline to ensure both redistribution of wealth and economic growth . The United Nations ( UN ) Human Development Index ( HDI ) of South Africa fell from 1995 to 2005 , while it was steadily rising until the mid-1990s , before recovering its 1995 peak in 2013 . This is in large part attributable to the HIV/AIDS in South Africa South African HIV/AIDS pandemic which saw South African life expectancy fall from a high point of 62.25 years in 1992 to a low of 52.57 in 2005 , and the failure of the government to take steps to address the pandemic in its early years .
In May 2008 , riots left over 60 people dead . The Centre on Housing Rights and Evictions estimated that over 100,000 people were driven from their homes . The targets were mainly Immigration to South Africa and Illegal immigration to South Africa and refugees seeking asylum , but a third of the victims were South African citizens . In a 2006 survey , the South African Migration Project concluded that South Africans are more opposed to immigration than any other national group . The United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees in 2008 reported over 200,000 refugees applied for asylum in South Africa , almost four times as many as the year before . These people were mainly from Zimbabwe , though many also come from Burundi , Democratic Republic of the Congo , Rwanda , Eritrea , Ethiopia and Somalia . Competition over jobs , business opportunities , public services and housing has led to tension between refugees and host communities . While xenophobia in South Africa is still a problem , recent violence has not been as widespread as initially feared . Nevertheless , as South Africa continues to grapple with racial issues , one of the proposed solutions has been to pass legislation , such as the pending The Prevention and Combating of Hate Crimes and Hate Speech Bill , to uphold South Africa 's ban on racism and commitment to equality .
== Geography ==
South Africa is located at the southernmost region of Africa , with a long coastline that stretches more than and along two oceans ( the South Atlantic and the Indian ) . At , according to the UN Demographic Yearbook , South Africa is the 24th-largest country in the world . It is about the same size as Colombia , twice the size of France , three times as big as Japan , four times the size of Italy and five times the size of the United Kingdom .
Mafadi in the Drakensberg at is the highest peak in South Africa . Excluding the Prince Edward Islands , the country lies between latitudes 22nd parallel south 22 and 35th parallel south 35S , and longitudes 16th meridian east 16 and 33rd meridian east 33E .
The interior of South Africa consists of a vast , in most places almost flat , plateau with an altitude of between and , highest in the east and sloping gently downwards towards the west and north , and slightly less noticeably so to the south and south-west . This plateau is surrounded by the Great Escarpment , Southern Africa whose eastern , and highest , stretch is known as the Drakensberg .
The south and south-western parts of the plateau ( at approximately 1,1001,800m above sea level ) , and the adjoining plain below ( at approximately 700800m above sea levelsee map on the right ) is known as the Karoo , which consists of sparsely populated scrubland . To the north , the Great Karoo fades into the even drier and more arid Bushmanland , which eventually becomes the Kalahari desert in the very north-west of the country . The mid-eastern , and highest part of the plateau is known as the Highveld . This relatively well-watered area is home to a great proportion of the country 's commercial farmlands and contains its largest conurbation ( Gauteng ) . To the north of Highveld , from about the 2530 'S line of latitude , the plateau slopes downwards into the Bushveld , which ultimately gives way to the Limpopo lowlands or Veld # Highveld and Lowveld .
The coastal belt , below the Great Escarpment , moving clockwise from the northeast , consists of the Limpopo Lowveld , which merges into the Mpumalanga Lowveld , below the Mpumalanga Drakensberg ( the eastern portion of the Great Escarpment ) . This is hotter , drier and less intensely cultivated than the Highveld above the escarpment . The Kruger National Park , located in the provinces of Limpopo and Mpumalanga in northeastern South Africa , occupies a large portion of the Lowveld covering 19,633 square kilometres ( 7,580 sq mi . ) South of the Lowveld the annual rainfall increases as one enters KwaZulu-Natal Province , which , especially near the coast , is Subtropics hot and humid . The KwaZulu-NatalLesotho international border is formed by the highest portion of the Great Escarpment , or Drakensberg , which reaches an altitude of over . The climate at the foot of this part of the Drakensberg is temperate .
The coastal belt below the south and south-western stretches of the Great Escarpment contains several ranges of Cape Fold Belt which run parallel to the coast , separating the Great Escarpment from the ocean . ( These parallel ranges of fold mountains are shown on the map , above left . Note the course of the Great Escarpment to the north of these mountain ranges . ) The land ( at approximately 400500m above sea level ) between two of these ranges of fold mountains in the south ( i.e . between the Outeniqua Mountains and Langeberg ranges to the south and the Swartberg range to the north ) is known as the Karoo , which consists of semi-desert scrubland similar to that of the Great Karoo , except that its northern strip along the foothills of the Swartberg Mountains , has a somewhat higher rainfall and is , therefore , more cultivated than the Great Karoo . The Little Karoo is historically , and still , famous for its ostrich farming around the town of Oudtshoorn . The lowland area ( 700800m above sea level ) to the north of the Swartberg mountain range up to the Great Escarpment is the lowland part of the Great Karoo ( see map at top right ) , which is climatically and botanically almost indistinguishable from the Karoo above the Great Escarpment . The narrow coastal strip between the most seaward Cape Fold Mountain range ( i.e. , the LangebergOuteniqua mountains ) and the ocean has a moderately high year-round rainfall , especially in the George , Western Cape-Knysna-Plettenberg Bay region , which is known as the Garden Route . It is famous for the most extensive areas of indigenous forests in South Africa ( a generally forest-poor country ) .
In the south-west corner of the country , the Cape Peninsula forms the southernmost tip of the coastal strip which borders the Atlantic Ocean and ultimately terminates at the country 's border with Namibia at the Orange River . The Cape Peninsula has a Mediterranean climate , making it and its immediate surrounds the only portion of Sub-Saharan Africa which receives most of its rainfall in winter . The greater City of Cape Town is situated on the Cape Peninsula and is home to 3.7million people according to the 2011 population census . It is the country 's legislative capital .
The coastal belt to the north of the Cape Peninsula is bounded on the west by the Atlantic Ocean and the first row of northsouth running Cape Fold Mountains to the east . The Cape Fold Mountains peter out at about the 32S line of latitude , after which the coastal plain is bounded by the Great Escarpment itself . The most southerly portion of this coastal belt is known as the Swartland and Malmesbury Plain , which is an important wheat growing region , relying on winter rains . The region further north is known as Namaqualand , which becomes more and more arid as one approaches the Orange River . The little rain that falls tends to fall in winter , which results in one of the world 's most spectacular displays of flowers carpeting huge stretches of veld in spring ( AugustSeptember ) .
South Africa also has one possession , the small Subantarctic sub-Antarctic archipelago of the Prince Edward Islands , consisting of Marion Island ( ) and Prince Edward Island ( ) ( not to be confused with the Prince Edward Island ) .
=== Climate ===
South Africa has a generally temperate climate because it is surrounded by the Atlantic and Indian Oceans on three sides , because it is located in the climatically milder Southern Hemisphere , and because its average elevation rises steadily toward the north ( toward the equator ) and further inland . This varied topography and oceanic influence result in a great variety of climatic zones . The climatic zones range from the extreme desert of the southern Namib Desert in the farthest northwest to the lush subtropical climate in the east along the border with Mozambique and the Indian Ocean . Winters in South Africa occur between June and August .
The extreme southwest has a climate remarkably similar to that of the Mediterranean Sea with wet winters and hot , dry summers , hosting the famous fynbos biome of shrubland and Albany thickets . This area also produces much of the wine in South Africa . This region is also particularly known for its wind , which blows intermittently almost all year . The severity of this wind made passing around the Cape of Good Hope particularly treacherous for sailors , causing many shipwrecks . Further east on the south coast , rainfall is distributed more evenly throughout the year , producing a green landscape . This area is popularly known as the Garden Route .
The Free State is particularly flat because it lies centrally on the high plateau . North of the Vaal River , the Highveld becomes better watered and does not experience subtropical extremes of heat . Johannesburg , in the centre of the Highveld , is at above sea level and receives an annual rainfall of . Winters in this region are cold , although snow is rare .
The high Drakensberg mountains , which form the south-eastern escarpment of the Highveld , offer limited skiing opportunities in winter . The coldest place on mainland South Africa is Buffelsfontein in the Eastern Cape , where a temperature of was recorded in 2013 . The Prince Edward Islands have colder average annual temperatures , but Buffelsfontein has colder extremes . The deep interior of mainland South Africa has the hottest temperatures : a temperature of was recorded in 1948 in the Northern Cape Kalahari near Upington , Northern Cape , but this temperature is unofficial and was not recorded with standard equipment , the official highest temperature is at Vioolsdrif in January 1993.
=== Biodiversity ===
South Africa signed the Rio Convention on Biological Diversity on 4 June 1994 , and became a party to the convention on 2 November 1995 . It has subsequently produced a Biodiversity action plan , which was received by the convention on 7 June 2006 . The country is ranked sixth out of the world 's seventeen megadiverse countries . Ecotourism in South Africa has become more prevalent in recent years , as a possible method of maintaining and improving biodiversity .
==== Animals ====
Numerous mammals are found in the Bushveld including lions , African leopards , South African cheetahs , southern white rhinos , blue wildebeest , kudus , impalas , [ hippopotamus ] es and [ [ South African giraffes . A significant extent of the Bushveld exists in the north-east including Kruger National Park and the Sabi Sand Game Reserve , as well as in the far north in the Waterberg Biosphere . South Africa houses many endemic species , among them the critically endangered riverine rabbit ( Bunolagus monticullaris ) in the Karoo .
==== Fungi ====
Up to 1945 , more than 4900 species of Fungus ( including Lichen # Fungi lichen-forming species ) had been recorded . In 2006 , the number of fungi in South Africa was estimated at about 200,000 species , but did not take into account fungi associated with insects . If correct , then the number of South African fungi dwarfs that of its plants . In at least some major South African ecosystems , an exceptionally high percentage of fungi are highly specific in terms of the plants with which they occur . The country 's Biodiversity Strategy and Action Plan does not mention fungi ( including lichen-forming fungi ) .
==== Plants ====
With more than 22,000 different [ plants ] , or about 9 % of all the known species of plants on Earth , South Africa is particularly rich in plant diversity . The most prevalent biome in South Africa is the grassland , particularly on the Highveld , where the plant cover is dominated by different Poaceae , low shrubs , and acacia trees , mainly Camelthorn tree camel-thorn ( Vachellia erioloba ) . Vegetation becomes even more sparse towards the northwest due to low precipitation ( meteorology ) . There are several species of water-storing Succulent plant , like aloes and euphorbias , in the very hot and dry Namaqualand area . The grass and thorn savannah turns slowly into a bush savannah towards the north-east of the country , with denser growth . There are significant numbers of baobab trees in this area , near the northern end of Kruger National Park .
The fynbos biome , which makes up the majority of the area and plant life in the Cape floristic region , one of the six floral kingdoms , is located in a small region of the Western Cape and contains more than 9,000 of those species , making it among the richest regions on earth in terms of plant diversity . Most of the plants are evergreen hard-leaf plants with fine , needle-like leaves , such as the sclerophyllous plants . Another uniquely South African flowering plant group is the genus Protea . There are around 130 different species of Protea in South Africa .
While South Africa has a great wealth of flowering plants , only one percent of South Africa is forest , almost exclusively in the humid KwaZulu-Cape coastal forest mosaic coastal plain of KwaZulu-Natal , where there are also areas of Southern Africa mangroves in river mouths . There are even smaller reserves of forests that are out of the reach of fire , known as Knysna-Amatole montane forests . Plantations of imported tree species are predominant , particularly the non-native eucalyptus and pine .
=== Conservation issues ===
South Africa has lost a large area of natural habitat in the last four decades , primarily due to overpopulation , sprawling development patterns and deforestation during the 19th century . The country had a 2019 Forest Landscape Integrity Index mean score of 4.94/10 , ranking it 112th globally out of 172 countries . South Africa is one of the worst affected countries in the world when it comes to invasion by alien species with many ( e.g. , Acacia mearnsii , Acacia saligna , Hakea , Lantana and Jacaranda ) posing a significant threat to the native biodiversity and the already scarce water resources . The original Temperate broadleaf and mixed forests found by the first European settlers was exploited ruthlessly until only small patches remained . Currently , South African [ trees like real yellowwood ] ( Podocarpus latifolius ) , [ [ Ocotea bullata ( Ocotea bullata ) , and South African Olea laurifolia ( Olea laurifolia ) are under government protection . Statistics from the South African Department of Environmental Affairs show a record 1,215 rhinos have been killed in 2014.
Climate change is expected to bring considerable warming and drying to much of this already semi-arid region , with greater frequency and intensity of extreme weather events such as [ wave ] s , flooding and drought . According to computer-generated climate modelling produced by the South African National Biodiversity Institute , parts of southern Africa will see an increase in temperature by about along the coast to more than in the already hot [ such as the Northern Cape in late spring and summertime by 2050 . The Cape Floral Region ] , being identified as one of the global [ [ biodiversity hotspots , will be hit very hard by climate change . Drought , increased intensity and frequency of fire , and climbing temperatures are expected to push many rare species towards extinction . South Africa has published two national climate change reports in 2011 and 2016.
== Politics and government ==
South Africa is a parliamentary republic , although unlike most such republics the President of South Africa is both [ of state ] and [ of government ] , and depends for his tenure on the Confidence and supply of Parliament of South Africa . The executive , legislature and judiciary are all subject to the supremacy of the Constitution of South Africa , and the Courts of South Africa have the power to strike down executive actions and acts of Parliament if they are unconstitutional .
The National Assembly of South Africa , the lower house of Parliament , consists of 400 members and is elected every five years by a system of party-list proportional representation . The National Council of Provinces , the upper house , consists of ninety members , with each of the nine provincial legislature ( South Africa ) electing ten members .
After each parliamentary election , the National Assembly elects one of its members as president ; hence the President serves a term of office the same as that of the Assembly , normally five years . No President may serve more than two terms in office . The President appoints a Deputy President of South Africa and Minister ( government ) , who form the Cabinet of South Africa which consists of Departmentalization . The President and the Cabinet may be removed by the National Assembly by a motion of no confidence .
In the 2019 South African general election , held on 8 May 2019 , the ANC won 57.5 % of the vote and 230 seats , while the main opposition , the Democratic Alliance ( South Africa ) ( DA ) won 20.77 % of the vote and 84 seats . The Economic Freedom Fighters ( EFF ) , founded by Julius Malema , former President of the ANC 's Youth Wing ( ANC Youth League ) who was later expelled from the ANC , won 10.79 % of the vote and 44 seats . The ANC has been the governing political party in South Africa since the end of apartheid .
South Africa has no legally defined capital city . The fourth chapter of the Constitution of South Africa , states that `` The seat of Parliament is Cape Town , but an Act of Parliament enacted in accordance with section 76 ( 1 ) and ( 5 ) may determine that the seat of Parliament is elsewhere . '' The country 's three branches of government are split over different cities . Cape Town , as the seat of Parliament , is the legislative capital ; Pretoria , as the seat of the President and Cabinet , is the administrative capital ; and Bloemfontein , as the seat of the Supreme Court of Appeal of South Africa , is the judicial capital , while the Constitutional Court of South Africa sits in Johannesburg . Most foreign embassies are located in Pretoria .
Since 2004 , South Africa has had many thousands of popular protests , some violent , making it , according to one academic , the `` most protest-rich country in the world '' . There have been a number of incidents of Political repression in post-Apartheid South Africa as well as threats of future repression in violation of the constitution , leading some analysts and civil society organisations to conclude that there is or could be a new climate of political repression , or a decline in political tolerance .
In 2008 , South Africa placed fifth out of 48 sub-Saharan African countries on the Ibrahim Index of African Governance . South Africa scored well in the categories of Rule of Law , Transparency ( social ) and Corruption , and Participation ( decision making ) and Human Rights , but was let down by its relatively poor performance in Safety and Security . In November 2006 , South Africa became the first African country to legalise same-sex marriage .
=== Law ===
The Constitution of South Africa is the supreme rule of law in the country . The primary sources of South African law are Roman-Dutch law Roman-Dutch mercantile law and personal law with English Common law , as imports of Dutch settlements and British colonialism . The first European based law in South Africa was brought by the Dutch East India Company and is called Roman-Dutch law . It was imported before the Codification ( law ) of European law into the Napoleonic Code and is comparable in many ways to Scots law . This was followed in the 19th century by English law , both Common law and Statutory law . After unification in 1910 , South Africa had its own parliament which passed laws specific for South Africa , building on those previously passed for the individual member colonies .
The judicial system consists of the Magistrates ' Courts of South Africa magistrates ' courts , which hear lesser criminal cases and smaller civil cases ; the High Court of South Africa , which has divisions that serve as the courts of general jurisdiction for specific areas ; the Supreme Court of Appeal of South Africa , and the Constitutional Court of South Africa , which is the highest court .
From April 2017 to March 2018 , on average 57 murders were committed each day in South Africa . In the year ended March 2017 , there were 20,336 murders and the murder rate was 35.9 per 100,000  over five times higher than the global average of 6.2 per 100,000 . Middle-class South Africans seek security in gated community . The private security industry in South Africa is the largest in the world , with nearly 9,000 registered companies and 400,000 registered active private security guards , more than the South African police and army combined . Many emigrants from South Africa also state that crime was a major factor in their decision to leave . South African Farmer Murders has continued to be a major problem . In an attempt to reduce crime rate , the police arrested over 500 undocumented foreigners in a raid in August 2019.
South Africa has a high rape rate , with 43,195 rapes reported in 2014/15 , and an unknown number of sexual assaults going unreported . A 2009 survey of 1,738 men in KwaZulu-Natal and the Eastern Cape by the Medical Research Council found one in four men admitted to raping someone and another survey of 4,000 women in Johannesburg by CIET Africa found one in three said they had been raped in the past year . Rape occurs most commonly in relationships but many men and women say that rape can not occur in relationships ; however , one in four women reported having been abused by an intimate partner . Rapes are also perpetrated by children ( some as young as ten ) . The incidence of Child sexual abuse is among the highest in the world , largely as a result of the virgin cleansing myth , and a number of high-profile cases ( sometimes as young as eight months ) have outraged the nation .
Between 1994 and 2018 , there were more than 500 xenophobic Xenophobia in South Africa in South Africa . The 2019 Johannesburg riots were similar in nature and origin to the Xenophobia in South Africa # May 2008 riots that also occurred in Johannesburg .
=== Foreign relations ===
As the Union of South Africa , the country was a founding member of the UN . The then Prime Minister Jan Smuts wrote the preamble to the United Nations Charter . South Africa is one of the founding members of the African Union ( AU ) , and has the List of African countries by GDP ( nominal ) . It is also a founding member of the AU 's New Partnership for Africa 's Development ( NEPAD ) .
South Africa has played a key role as a mediator in African conflicts over the last decade , such as in Burundi , the Democratic Republic of Congo ( DRC ) , the Comoros , and Zimbabwe . After apartheid ended , South Africa was readmitted to the Commonwealth of Nations . The country is a member of the Group of 77 and chaired the organisation in 2006 . South Africa is also a member of the Southern African Development Community ( SADC ) , South Atlantic Peace and Cooperation Zone , Southern African Customs Union ( SACU ) , Antarctic Treaty System ( ATS ) , World Trade Organization ( WTO ) , International Monetary Fund ( IMF ) , G20 industrial nations , G8+5 , and the Port Management Association of Eastern and Southern Africa .
Former South African President Jacob Zuma and former Chinese President Hu Jintao upgraded bilateral ties between the two countries on 24 August 2010 , when they signed the Beijing Agreement , which elevated South Africa 's earlier `` strategic partnership '' with China to the higher level of `` comprehensive strategic partnership '' in both economic and political affairs , including the strengthening of exchanges between their respective ruling parties and legislatures . In April 2011 , South Africa formally joined the Brazil-Russia-India-China ( BRICS ) grouping of countries , identified by Zuma as the country 's largest trading partners , and also the largest trading partners with Africa as a whole . Zuma asserted that BRICS member countries would also work with each other through the UN , the Group of Twenty ( G20 ) and the India , Brazil South Africa ( IBSA Dialogue Forum ) forum .
=== Military ===
The South African National Defence Force ( SANDF ) was created in 1994 , as an Volunteer military all-volunteer military composed of the former South African Defence Force , the forces of the African nationalist groups ( Umkhonto we Sizwe and Azanian People 's Liberation Army ) , and the former Bantustan defence forces . The SANDF is subdivided into four branches , the South African Army , the South African Air Force , the South African Navy , and the South African Military Health Service . In recent years , the SANDF has become a major peacekeeping force in Africa , and has been involved in operations in Lesotho , the DRC , and Burundi , amongst others . It has also served in multinational UN Peacekeeping forces such as the United Nations Force Intervention Brigade for example .
South Africa is the only African country to have successfully developed Nuclear weapons and South Africa . It became the first country ( followed by Ukraine ) with nuclear capability to voluntarily renounce and dismantle its programme and in the process signed the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty in 1991 . South Africa undertook a South African nuclear program in the 1970s According to former state president FW de Klerk , the decision to build a `` nuclear deterrent '' was taken `` as early as 1974 against a backdrop of a Soviet expansionist threat . '' South Africa is Vela Incident a nuclear test over the Atlantic in 1979 , although this is officially denied . Former president , FW de Klerk , maintained that South Africa had `` never conducted a clandestine nuclear test . '' Six nuclear devices were completed between 1980 and 1990 , but all were dismantled before South Africa signed the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty in 1991 . In 2017 , South Africa signed the UN treaty on the Treaty on the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons .
=== Administrative divisions ===
Each of the nine provinces is governed by a Unicameralism provincial legislature ( South Africa ) , which is elected every five years by party-list proportional representation . The legislature elects a Premier ( South Africa ) as head of government , and the Premier appoints an Executive Council ( South Africa ) as a provincial cabinet . The powers of provincial governments are limited to topics listed in the Constitution of South Africa ; these topics include such fields as health , education , public housing and transport .
The provinces are in turn divided into 52 Districts of South Africa : 8 Metropolitan municipality ( South Africa ) and 44 District municipality ( South Africa ) . The district municipalities are further subdivided into 205 Local municipality ( South Africa ) . The metropolitan municipalities , which govern the largest urban agglomerations , perform the functions of both district and local municipalities .
== Economy ==
South Africa has a mixed economy , the second largest in Africa after Nigeria . It also has a relatively high gross domestic product ( GDP ) per capita compared to other countries in sub-Saharan Africa ( US $ 11,750 at purchasing power parity as of 2012 ) . Despite this , South Africa is still burdened by a relatively high rate of poverty and unemployment , and is also ranked in the top ten countries in the world for income inequality , measured by the Gini coefficient . In 2015 , 71 percent of net wealth are held by 10 percent richest of the population , whereas 60 percent of the poorest held only 7 percent of the net wealth and the Gini coefficient was 0.63 , whereas in 1996 was 0.61.
Unlike most of the world 's poor countries , South Africa does not have a thriving informal economy . Only 15 % of South African jobs are in the informal sector , compared with around half in Economy of Brazil and Economy of India and nearly three-quarters in Economy of Indonesia . The OECD Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development ( OECD ) attributes this difference to South Africa 's widespread welfare system . World Bank research shows that South Africa has one of the widest gaps between per capita GDP versus its Human Development Index ( HDI ) ranking , with only Botswana showing a larger gap .
After 1994 , government policy brought down inflation , stabilised public finances , and some foreign capital was attracted , however growth was still subpar . From 2004 onward , economic growth picked up significantly ; both employment and capital formation increased . During the presidency of Jacob Zuma , the government increased the role of state-owned enterprises ( SOEs ) . Some of the biggest SOEs are Eskom , the electric power monopoly , South African Airways ( SAA ) , and Transnet , the railroad and ports monopoly . Some of these SOEs have not been profitable , such as SAA , which has required bailouts totaling R30 ; billion ( $ billion ) over 20 years .
Principal international trading partners of South Africabesides other African countriesinclude Germany , the United States , China , Japan , the United Kingdom and Spain .
The Agriculture in South Africa contributes around 10 % of formal employment , relatively low compared to other parts of Africa , as well as providing work for casual labourers and contributing around 2.6 % of GDP for the nation . Due to the aridity of the land , only 13.5 % can be used for crop production , and only 3 % is considered high potential land .
In August 2013 , South Africa was ranked as the top African Country of the Future by fDi magazine based on the country 's economic potential , labour environment , cost-effectiveness , infrastructure , business friendliness , and foreign direct investment strategy .
The Financial Secrecy Index ( FDI ) ranks South Africa as the 50th safest tax haven in the world .
=== Tourism ===
South Africa is a popular tourist destination , and a substantial amount of revenue comes from tourism .
=== Labour market ===
During 19952003 , the number of formal jobs decreased and informal jobs increased ; overall unemployment worsened .
The government 's Black Economic Empowerment ( BEE ) policies have drawn criticism from Neva Makgetla , lead economist for research and information at the Development Bank of Southern Africa , for focusing `` almost exclusively on promoting individual ownership by black people [ which ] does little to address broader economic disparities , though the rich may become more diverse . '' Official affirmative action policies have seen a rise in black economic wealth and an emerging black middle class . Other problems include state ownership and State intervention , which impose high barriers to entry in many areas . Restrictive labour regulations have contributed to the unemployment malaise .
Along with many African nations , South Africa has been experiencing a `` brain drain '' in the past 20 years . and is almost certainly detrimental for the wellbeing of those reliant on the healthcare infrastructure . The skills drain in South Africa tends to demonstrate racial contours given the skills distribution legacy of South Africa and has thus resulted in large white South African communities abroad . However , the statistics which purport to show a brain drain are disputed and also do not account for repatriation and expiry of foreign work contracts . According to several surveys , there has been a reverse in brain drain following the global financial crisis of 20082009 and expiration of foreign work contracts . In the first quarter of 2011 , confidence levels for graduate professionals were recorded at a level of 84 % in a Professional Provident Society ( PPS ) survey . Illegal immigrants are involved in informal trading . Many immigrants to South Africa continue to live in poor conditions , and the immigration policy has become increasingly restrictive since the year 1994.
The Human Rights Watch reported on 26 August 2019 about foreign national truck drivers being subjected to deadly attacks carried out by South African truck drivers . The organization urged the South African government to take immediate actions ensuring the safety of the foreign national truck drivers putting up with violence , harassment , intimidation , stoning , bombing , and shooting , by local truck drivers in the country .
=== Science and technology ===
Several important scientific and technological developments have originated in South Africa . The first human-to-human Heart transplantation was performed by cardiac surgeon Christiaan Barnard at Groote Schuur Hospital in December 1967 , Max Theiler developed a Yellow fever vaccine against yellow fever , Allan McLeod Cormack pioneered X-ray computed tomography ( CT scan ) , and Aaron Klug developed crystallographic electron microscopy techniques . With the exception of that of Barnard , all of these advancements were recognised with Nobel Prizes . Sydney Brenner won most recently , in 2002 , for his pioneering work in molecular biology .
Mark Shuttleworth founded an early Internet security company Thawte , that was subsequently bought out by world-leader VeriSign . Despite government efforts to encourage entrepreneurship in biotechnology , information technology and other high technology fields , no other notable groundbreaking companies have been founded in South Africa . It is the expressed objective of the government to transition the economy to be more reliant on high technology , based on the realisation that South Africa can not compete with Far Eastern economies in manufacturing , nor can the republic rely on its mineral wealth in perpetuity .
South Africa has cultivated a burgeoning astronomy community . It hosts the Southern African Large Telescope , the largest optical telescope in the Southern Hemisphere . South Africa is currently building the Karoo Array Telescope as a pathfinder for the 1.5 ; billion Square Kilometre Array project . On 25 May 2012 , it was announced that hosting of the Square Kilometer Array Telescope will be split over both the South African and the Australia and New Zealand sites .
=== Water supply and sanitation ===
Two distinctive features of the South African water sector are the policy of free basic water and the existence of Water Board ( South Africa ) , which are bulk water supply agencies that operate pipelines and sell water from reservoirs to municipalities . These features have led to significant problems concerning the financial sustainability of service providers , leading to a lack of attention to maintenance . Following the end of apartheid , the country had made improvements in the levels of access to water as those with access increased from 66 % to 79 % from 1990 to 2010 . Sanitation access increased from 71 % to 79 % during the same period . However , water supply and sanitation in South Africa has come under increasing pressure in recent years despite a commitment made by the government to improve service standards and provide investment subsidies to the water industry .
The eastern parts of South Africa suffer from periodic droughts linked to the El Nio weather phenomenon . In early 2018 , Cape Town , which has different weather patterns to the rest of the country , faced a water crisis as the city 's water supply was predicted to run dry before the end of June . Water-saving measures were in effect that required each citizen to use less than a day .
==Transport==
Different methods of transport in South Africa include roads , railways , airports , water , and pipelines for petroleum oil . The majority of people in South Africa use informal Share taxi as their main mode of transport . Bus rapid transit has been implemented in some South African cities in an attempt to provide more formalised and safer public transport services . These systems have been widely criticised due to their large capital and operating costs . A `` freeway '' is different from most countries as certain things are forbidden which include certain motorcycles , no hand signals , and motor tricycles . South Africa has many major ports including Cape Town , Durban , and Port Elizabeth that allow ships and other boats to pass through , some carrying passengers and some carrying Oil tanker .
==Demographics==
South Africa is a nation of about 55 million ( 2016 ) people of diverse origins , cultures , languages , and religions . The last South African National Census of 2011 was held in 2011 , with a more recent intercensal national survey conducted in 2016 . South Africa is home to an estimated five ; million illegal immigrants , including some three ; million Zimbabweans . A series of 2008 South Africa riots anti-immigrant riots occurred in South Africa beginning on 11 May 2008.
Statistics South Africa asks people to describe themselves in the census in terms of five Race ( classification of human beings ) population groups . The 2011 census figures for these groups were : Bantu peoples in South Africa at 79.2 % , White South African at 8.9 % , Cape Coloureds at 8.9 % , Asian South African at 2.5 % , and Other/Unspecified at 0.5 % . The first census in South Africa in 1911 showed that whites made up 22 % of the population ; this had declined to 16 % by 1980.
South Africa hosts a sizeable refugee and asylum seeker population . According to the World Refugee Survey 2008 , published by the US Committee for Refugees and Immigrants , this population numbered approximately 144,700 in 2007 . Groups of refugees and asylum seekers numbering over 10,000 included people from Zimbabwe ( 48,400 ) , the DRC ( 24,800 ) , and Somalia ( 12,900 ) . These populations mainly lived in Johannesburg , Pretoria , Durban , Cape Town , and Port Elizabeth .
=== Languages ===
South Africa has 11 official languages : Zulu language , Xhosa language , Afrikaans , South African English , Northern Sotho , Tswana language , Sotho language , Tsonga language , Swazi language , Venda language , and Southern Ndebele language ( in order of first language speakers ) . In this regard it is fourth only to Bolivia , Official languages of India , and Zimbabwe in number . While all the languages are formally equal , some languages are spoken more than others . According to the 2011 census , the three most spoken first languages are Zulu ( 22.7 % ) , Xhosa ( 16.0 % ) , and Afrikaans ( 13.5 % ) . Although English is recognised as the language of commerce and science , it is only the fourth most common home language , that of only 9.6 % of South Africans in 2011 ; nevertheless , it has become the de facto lingua franca of the nation . Estimates based on the 1991 census suggest just under half of South Africans can speak English . It is the second most commonly spoken language outside of the household , after Zulu .
The country also recognises several unofficial languages , including Fanagalo language , Khoe language , Lobedu language , Nama language , Northern Ndebele language , Phuthi language , and South African Sign Language . These unofficial languages may be used in certain official uses in limited areas where it has been determined that these languages are prevalent .
Many of the unofficial Khoisan languages people contain regional dialects stretching northwards into Namibia and Botswana , and elsewhere . These people , who are a physically distinct population from other Africans , have their own cultural identity based on their [ societies . They have been marginalised to a great extent , and the remainder of their languages are in danger of becoming Extinct language extinct ] .
White South Africans may also speak [ [ European languages , including Italian language , Portuguese language ( also spoken by black Angolans and Mozambique ) , Dutch language , German language , and Greek language , while some Indian South Africans speak Languages of India , such as Gujarati language , Hindi language , Tamil language , Telugu language , and Urdu language . French language is spoken in South Africa by migrants from Francophone Africa .
=== Urban centres ===
=== Religions ===
According to the 2001 census , Christians accounted for 79.8 % of the population , with a majority of them being members of various Protestant Christian denomination ( broadly defined to include Syncretism African initiated churches ) and a minority of Roman Catholics and other Christians . Christian category includes Zion Christian Church ( 11.1 % ) , Pentecostalism ( Charismatic movement ) ( 8.2 % ) , Roman Catholicism in South Africa ( 7.1 % ) , Methodist Church of Southern Africa ( 6.8 % ) , Nederduits Gereformeerde Kerk ( Nederduits Gereformeerde Kerk ; 6.7 % ) , and Anglican Church of Southern Africa ( 3.8 % ) . Members of remaining Christian churches accounted for another 36 % of the population . Islam in South Africa accounted for 1.5 % of the population , Hinduism in South Africa 1.2 % , traditional African religion 0.3 % and Judaism 0.2 % . 15.1 % had no religious affiliation , 0.6 % were `` other '' and 1.4 % were `` unspecified . ''
African initiated churches formed the largest of the Christian groups . It was believed that many of the persons who claimed no affiliation with any organised religion adhered to traditional African religion . There are an estimated 200,000 Traditional healers of South Africa in South Africa , and up to 60 % of South Africans consult these healers , generally called sangomas or inyangas . These healers use a combination of Veneration of the dead and a belief in the spiritual and medicinal properties of local fauna and flora , commonly known as Traditional African medicine , to facilitate healing in clients . Many peoples have syncretic religious practices combining Christian and indigenous influences .
South African Muslims comprise mainly of those who are described as Coloureds and those who are described as Indian South African . They have been joined by black or white South African Religious conversion as well as others from other parts of Africa . South African Muslims claim that their faith is the fastest-growing religion of conversion in the country , with the number of black Muslims growing sixfold , from 12,000 in 1991 to 74,700 in 2004.
South Africa is also home to a substantial History of the Jews in South Africa , descended from History of the Jews in Europe who arrived as a minority among other European settlers . This population peaked in the 1970s at 120,000 , though only around 67,000 remain today , the rest having emigrated , mostly to Israel . Even so , these numbers make the Jewish community in South Africa the twelfth largest in the world .
=== Education ===
The adult literacy rate in 2007 was 88.7 % . South Africa has a Three-tier education three-tier system of education starting with primary school , followed by high school and tertiary education in the form of ( academic ) universities and universities of technology . Learners have twelve years of formal schooling , from grade 1 to 12 . Grade R , or grade 0 , is a pre-primary foundation year . Primary schools span the first seven years of schooling . High school education spans a further five years . The National Senior Certificate ( NSC ) examination takes place at the end of grade 12 and is necessary for tertiary studies at a List of universities in South Africa .
Public universities in South Africa are divided into three types : traditional universities , which offer theoretically oriented university degrees ; University of Technology ( formerly called `` technikons '' ) , which offer vocational oriented diplomas and degrees ; and comprehensive universities , which offer both types of qualification . There are 23 public universities in South Africa : 11 traditional universities , 6 universities of technology and 6 comprehensive universities .
Under apartheid , schools for black people were subject to discrimination through inadequate funding and a separate syllabus called Bantu Education Act which was only designed to give them sufficient skills to work as labourers .
In 2004 , South Africa started reforming its tertiary education system , merging and incorporating small universities into larger institutions , and renaming all tertiary education institutions `` university '' . By 2015 , 1.4 ; million students in higher education have benefited from a financial aid scheme which was promulgated in 1999.
=== Health ===
According to the South African Institute of Race Relations , the life expectancy in 2009 was 71 years for a white South African and 48 years for a black South African . The healthcare spending in the country is about 9 % of GDP .
About 84 % of the population depends on the public healthcare system , which is beset with chronic human resource shortages and limited resources .
About 20 % of the population uses private healthcare . Only 16 % of the population is covered by [ insurance medical aid schemes ] . The rest pay for private care `` Out-of-pocket expenses '' or through in-hospital-only plans . The three dominant hospital groups , Mediclinic International , LIFE Healthcare Group and Netcare , together control 75 % of the private hospital market .
==== HIV/AIDS ====
According to the 2015 UNAIDS Report , South Africa has an estimated seven million people living with HIV ;  more than any other country in the world . In 2018 , HIV prevalencethe percentage of people living with HIVamong adults ( 1549 years ) was 20.4 % and in the same year 71000 people died from an AIDS-related illness .
A 2008 study revealed that HIV/AIDS infection in South Africa is distinctly divided along racial lines : 13.6 % of blacks are HIV-positive , whereas only 0.3 % of whites have the disease . Most deaths are experienced by economically active individuals , resulting in many AIDS orphans who in many cases depend on the state for care and financial support . It is estimated that there are 1,200,000 orphans in South Africa .
The link between HIV , a virus spread primarily by sexual contact , and AIDS was long AIDS denial by former president Thabo Mbeki and his health minister Manto Tshabalala-Msimang , who insisted that the many deaths in the country are due to Malnutrition in South Africa , and hence poverty , and not HIV . In 2007 , in response to international pressure , the government made efforts to fight AIDS .
After the South African general election , 2009 , former president Jacob Zuma appointed Aaron Motsoaledi as the new health minister and committed his government to increasing funding for and widening the scope of HIV treatment , and by 2015 , South Africa had made significant progress , with the widespread availability of Anti-retroviral drugs resulted in an increase in life expectancy from 52.1 years to 62.5 years .
== Culture ==
The South African black majority still has a substantial number of rural inhabitants who lead largely impoverished lives . It is among these people that cultural traditions survive most strongly ; as blacks have become increasingly urbanised and Western world , aspects of traditional culture have declined . Members of the middle class , who are predominantly white but whose ranks include growing numbers of black , coloured and Indian people , have lifestyles similar in many respects to that of people found in Western Europe , North America and Australasia .
=== Arts ===
South African art includes the oldest art objects in the world , which were discovered in a South African cave , and dated from 75,000 years ago .
The scattered tribes of Khoisan peoples moving into South Africa from around 10,000 BC had their own fluent art styles seen today in a multitude of cave paintings . They were superseded by Bantu peoples/Nguni peoples with their own vocabularies of art forms . New forms of art evolved in the mines and townships : a dynamic art using everything from plastic strips to bicycle spokes . The Dutch-influenced folk art of the Afrikaner Trekboer and the urban white artists , earnestly following changing European traditions from the 1850s onwards , also contributed to this eclectic mix which continues to evolve today .
South African literature emerged from a unique social and political history . One of the first well known novels written by a black author in an African language was Sol Plaatje 's Mhudi , written in 1930 . During the 1950s , Drum ( South African magazine ) magazine became a hotbed of political satire , fiction , and essays , giving a voice to urban black culture .
Notable white South African authors include Alan Paton , who published the novel Cry , the Beloved Country in 1948 . Nadine Gordimer became the first South African to be awarded the Nobel Prize for Literature , in 1991 . J. M. Coetzee won the Nobel Prize for Literature , in 2003 . When awarding the prize , the Swedish Academy stated that Coetzee `` in innumerable guises portrays the surprising involvement of the outsider . ''
The plays of Athol Fugard have been regularly premiered in fringe theatres in South Africa , London ( Royal Court Theatre ) and New York . Olive Schreiner 's The Story of an African Farm ( 1883 ) was a revelation in Victorian literature : it is heralded by many as introducing feminism into the novel form .
Breyten Breytenbach was jailed for his involvement with the guerrilla movement against apartheid . Andr Brink was the first Afrikaner writer to be banned book by the government after he released the novel A Dry White Season ( novel ) .
=== Popular culture ===

== Etymology ==
The `` H '' in the name of Hungary ( and Latin Hungaria ) is most likely due to founded historical associations with the Huns , who had settled Hungary prior to the Pannonian Avars . The rest of the word comes from the Latinized form of medieval Greek Oungroi (  ) . The Greek name was borrowed from Old Church Slavonic grin , in turn borrowed from Oghur languages Oghur-Turkic Onogurs ( 'ten [ tribes of the ] Ogurs ' ) . Onogur was the collective name for the tribes who later joined the Bulgars tribal confederacy that ruled the eastern parts of Hungary after the Avars .
The Hungarian endonym is Magyarorszg , composed of magyar ( 'Hungarian ' ) and orszg ( 'country ' ) . The name `` Magyar '' , which refers to the people of the country , more accurately reflects the name of the country in some other languages such as Turkish language , Persian language and other languages as Magyaristan or Land of Magyars or similar . The word magyar is taken from the name of one of the seven major semi-nomadic Hungarian tribes , magyeri . The first element magy is likely from Proto-Ugric * m- 'man , person ' , also found in the name of the Mansi people ( m , mai , m ) . The second element eri , 'man , men , lineage ' , survives in Hungarian frj 'husband ' , and is cognate with Mari language erge 'son ' , Finnish language archaic yrk 'young man ' .
== History ==
=== Before 895 ===
The Roman Empire conquered the territory west of the Danube River between 35 and 9 ; BC . From 9 ; BC to the end of the 4th century AD , Pannonia , the western part of the Carpathian Basin , was part of the Roman Empire . After the Western Roman Empire collapsed in the 5th century AD under the stress of the migration of Germanic peoples and Carpi ( people ) pressure , the Migration Period continued to bring many invaders into Central Europe , beginning with the Huns ( c. 370469 ) . The most powerful ruler of the Hunnic Empire was Attila the Hun ( 434453 ) who later became a central figure in Hungarian mythology . After the disintegration of the Hunnic Empire , the Gepids , an Eastern Germanic tribe , who had been vassalized by the Huns , established their own kingdom in the Carpathian Basin . Other groups which reached the Carpathian Basin in the Migration Period were the Goths , Vandals , Lombards , and Early Slavs . In the 560s , the Pannonian Avars founded the Avar Khaganate , a state that maintained supremacy in the region for more than two centuries . The Franks under Charlemagne defeated the Avars in a series of campaigns during the 790s . By the mid-9th century , the Pannonian Slavs # Principality , also known as Lower Pannonia , was established west of the Danube river as part of the Frankish March of Pannonia . The First Bulgarian Empire conquered the lands east of the Danube river and took over rule of the local Slavic tribes and remnants of the Avars .
===Medieval Hungary ( 8951526 ) ===
The freshly unified Magyar tribes led by rpd ( by tradition a descendant of Attila ) , settled in the Carpathian Basin starting in 895 . According to the Finno-Ugric languages Finno-Ugrian theory , they originated from an ancient Uralic languages-speaking population that formerly inhabited the forested area between the Volga River and the Ural Mountains .
As a federation of united tribes , Hungarian Conquest of the Carpathian Basin , some 50 years after the division of the Carolingian Empire at the Treaty of Verdun in 843 , before the unification of the Kingdom of England Anglo-Saxon kingdoms . Initially , the rising Principality of Hungary ( `` Western Tourkia '' in medieval Greek sources ) was a state created by a semi-nomadic people . It accomplished an enormous transformation into a Christian realm during the 10th century .
This state was well-functioning and the nation 's military power allowed the Hungarians to conduct successful Hungarian invasions of Europe , from Constantinople to as far as today 's Spain . The Hungarians defeated no fewer than Hungarian invasions of Europe between 907 and 910 . A later defeat at the Battle of Lechfeld in 955 signalled a provisory end to most campaigns on foreign territories , at least towards the West .
====Age of rpdian kings====
The year 972 marked the date when the ruling prince ( fejedelem ) Gza , Grand Prince of the Hungarians of the rpd dynasty officially started to integrate Hungary into the Christian Western Europe . His first-born son , Stephen I of Hungary , became the first King of Hungary after defeating his paganism uncle Koppny , who also claimed the throne . Under Stephen , Hungary was recognised as a Catholic Apostolic Kingdom . Applying to Pope Sylvester II , Stephen received the insignia of royalty ( including probably a part of the Holy Crown of Hungary , currently kept in the Hungarian Parliament Building ) from the papacy .
By 1006 , Stephen consolidated his power , and started sweeping reforms to convert Hungary into a Western Feudalism . The country switched to using the Latin language , and until as late as 1844 , Latin remained the official language of Hungary . Around this time , Hungary began to become a powerful kingdom . Ladislaus I of Hungary extended Hungary 's frontier in Transylvania and invaded Kingdom of Croatia ( medieval ) in 1091 . The Croatian campaign culminated in the Battle of Gvozd Mountain in 1097 and a Croatia in personal union with Hungary in 1102 , ruled by Coloman of Hungary i.e . Knyves Klmn .
The most powerful and wealthiest king of the rpd dynasty was Bla III of Hungary , who disposed of the equivalent of 23 tonnes of pure silver a year . This exceeded the income of the French king ( estimated at 17 tonnes ) and was double the receipts of the English Crown .
Andrew II of Hungary issued the Diploma Andreanum which secured the special privileges of the Transylvanian Saxons and is considered the first Autonomy law in the world . He led the Fifth Crusade to the Holy Land in 1217 , setting up the largest royal army in the history of Crusades . His Golden Bull of 1222 was the first constitution in Continental Europe . The lesser nobles also began to present Andrew with grievances , a practice that evolved into the institution of the parliament ( parlamentum publicum ) .
In 12411242 , the kingdom received a major blow with the Mongolian invasion of Hungary Mongol ( Tatar ) invasion . Up to half of Hungary 's then population of 2,000,000 were victims of the invasion . King Bla IV let Cumans and Jassic people into the country , who were fleeing the Mongols . Over the centuries , they were fully assimilated into the Hungarian population .
As a consequence , after the Mongols retreated , King Bla ordered the construction of hundreds of stone castles and fortifications , to defend against a possible second Mongol invasion . The Second Mongol invasion of Hungary in 1285 , but the newly built stone-castle systems and new tactics ( using a higher proportion of heavily armed knights ) stopped them . The invading Mongol force was defeated near Pest by the royal army of Ladislaus IV of Hungary . As with later invasions , it was repelled handily , the Mongols losing much of their invading force .
==== Age of elected kings ====
The Kingdom of Hungary reached one of its greatest extents during the rpdian kings , yet royal power was weakened at the end of their rule in 1301 . After a destructive period of interregnum ( 13011308 ) , the first Capetian House of Anjou king , Charles I of Hungary  a bilineal descendant of the rpd dynasty  successfully restored royal power , and defeated oligarch rivals , the so-called `` little kings '' . The second Angevin Hungarian king , Louis I of Hungary ( 13421382 ) , led many successful military campaigns from Lithuania to Southern Italy ( Kingdom of Naples ) , and was also King of Poland from 1370 . After King Louis died without a male heir , the country was stabilized only when Sigismund , Holy Roman Emperor ( 13871437 ) succeeded to the throne , who in 1433 also became Holy Roman Emperor . Sigismund was also ( in several ways ) a bilineal descendant of the rpd dynasty .
The first Hungarian Bible translation was completed in 1439 . For half a year in 1437 , there was an antifeudal and anticlerical peasant revolt in Transylvania , the Budai Nagy Antal Revolt , which was strongly influenced by Hussite ideas .
From a small noble family in Transylvania , John Hunyadi grew to become one of the country 's most powerful lords , thanks to his outstanding capabilities as a mercenary commander . He was elected governor then regent . He was a successful crusader against the Ottoman Turks , one of his greatest victories being the Siege of Belgrade ( 1456 ) in 1456.
The last strong king of medieval Hungary was the Renaissance king Matthias Corvinus ( 14581490 ) , son of John Hunyadi . His election was the first time that a member of the nobility mounted to the Hungarian royal throne without dynastic background . He was a successful military leader and an enlightened patron of the arts and learning . His library , the Bibliotheca Corviniana , was Europe 's greatest collection of historical chronicles , philosophic and scientific works in the 15th century , and second only in size to the Vatican Library .

The serfs and common people considered him a just ruler because he protected them from excessive demands from and other abuses by the magnates . Under his rule , in 1479 , the Hungarian army destroyed the Ottoman and Wallachian troops at the Battle of Breadfield . Abroad he defeated the Polish and German imperial armies of Frederick at Breslau ( Wrocaw ) . Matthias ' mercenary standing army , the Black Army of Hungary , was an unusually large army for its time , and it conquered parts of Austria , Vienna ( 1485 ) and parts of Bohemia .
==== Decline of Hungary ( 14901526 ) ====
King Matthias died without lawful sons , and the Hungarian magnates procured the accession of the Pole Vladislaus II of Bohemia and Hungary ( 14901516 ) , supposedly because of his weak influence on Hungarian aristocracy . Hungary 's international role declined , its political stability shaken , and social progress was deadlocked . In 1514 , the weakened old King Vladislaus II faced a major peasant rebellion led by Gyrgy Dzsa , which was ruthlessly crushed by the Nobility in the Kingdom of Hungary , led by John Zpolya .
The resulting degradation of order paved the way for Ottoman pre-eminence . In 1521 , the strongest Hungarian fortress in the South , Nndorfehrvr ( today 's Belgrade , Serbia ) , Siege of Belgrade ( 1521 ) . The early appearance of Protestantism further worsened internal relations in the country .
=== Ottoman wars ( 15261699 ) ===
After some Ottoman wars in Europe with the Hungarians and other states , the Ottomans gained a decisive victory over the Hungarian army at the Battle of Mohcs in 1526 , where Louis II of Hungary died while fleeing . Amid political chaos , the divided Nobility in the Kingdom of Hungary elected two kings simultaneously , John Zpolya and Ferdinand I , Holy Roman Emperor of the Habsburg dynasty . With the conquest of Buda by the Turks in 1541 , Hungary was divided into three parts and remained so until the end of the 17th century . The north-western part , termed as Royal Hungary , was annexed by the Habsburgs who ruled as Kings of Hungary . The eastern part of the kingdom became independent as the Principality of Transylvania ( 15711711 ) , under Ottoman ( and later Habsburg ) suzerainty . The remaining central area , including the capital Buda , was known as the Ottoman Hungary .
The vast majority of the seventeen and nineteen thousand Ottoman soldiers in service in the Ottoman fortresses in the territory of Hungary were Orthodox and Muslim Balkan Slavs rather than ethnic Turkish people . Orthodox Southern Slavs were also acting as akinjis and other light troops intended for pillaging in the territory of present-day Hungary . In 1686 , the Holy League ( 1684 ) Holy League 's army , containing over 74,000 men from various nations , Battle of Buda ( 1686 ) from the Turks . After some more crushing Austro-Turkish War of 171618 in the next few years , the entire Kingdom of Hungary was removed from Ottoman rule by 1718 . The last raid into Hungary by the Ottoman vassals Crimean Khanate from Crimea took place in 1717 . The constrained Habsburg Counter-Reformation efforts in the 17th century reconverted the majority of the kingdom to Catholicism . The ethnic composition of Hungary was fundamentally changed as a consequence of the prolonged warfare with the Turks . A large part of the country became devastated , population growth was stunted , and many smaller settlements perished . The Austrian-Habsburg government settled large groups of Serbs and other Slavs in the depopulated south , and settled Germans of Hungary ( called Danube Swabians ) in various areas , but Hungarians were not allowed to settle or re-settle in the south of the Pannonian Plain .
=== From the 18th century to World War I ( 16991918 ) ===
Between 1703 and 1711 , there was a large-scale uprising led by Francis II Rkczi , who after the dethronement of the Habsburgs in 1707 at the Diet of nod , took power provisionally as the Ruling Prince of Hungary for the wartime period , but refused the Hungarian Crown and the title `` King '' . The uprisings lasted for years . The Hungarian Kuruc army , although taking over most of the country , lost the main Battle of Trencsn ( 1708 ) . Three years later , because of the growing desertion , defeatism and low morale , the Kuruc forces finally surrendered .
During the Napoleonic Wars and afterwards , the Hungarian Diet had not convened for decades . In the 1820s , the Emperor was forced to convene the Diet , which marked the beginning of a Reform Period ( 18251848 , reformkor ) . Count Istvn Szchenyi , one of the most prominent statesmen of the country , recognised the urgent need of modernisation and his message got through . The Hungarian Parliament was reconvened in 1825 to handle financial needs . A liberal party emerged and focused on providing for the peasantry . Lajos Kossuth  a famous journalist at that time  emerged as leader of the lower gentry in the Parliament . A remarkable upswing started as the nation concentrated its forces on modernisation even though the Habsburg monarchs obstructed all important liberal laws relating to civil and political rights and economic reforms . Many reformers ( Lajos Kossuth , Mihly Tncsics ) were imprisoned by the authorities .
On 15 March 1848 , mass demonstrations in Pest and Buda enabled Hungarian reformists to push through a list of 12 points of the Hungarian Revolutionaries of 1848 . Under governor and president Lajos Kossuth and the first Prime Minister , Lajos Batthyny , the House of Habsburg was dethroned .
The Habsburg Ruler and his advisors skilfully manipulated the Croatian , Serbian and Romanian peasantry , led by priests and officers firmly loyal to the Habsburgs , and induced them to rebel against the Hungarian government , though the Hungarians were supported by the vast majority of the Slovak , German and Rusyns nationalities and by all the Jews of the kingdom , as well as by a large number of Polish , Austrian and Italian volunteers . In July 1849 the Hungarian Parliament proclaimed and enacted the first laws of ethnic and minority rights in the world . Many members of the nationalities gained the coveted highest positions within the Hungarian Army , like General Jnos Damjanich , an ethnic Serb who became a Hungarian national hero through his command of the 3rd Hungarian Army Corps or Jzef Bem , who was Polish and also became a national hero in Hungary . The Hungarian forces ( Royal Hungarian Landwehr ) defeated Austrian armies . To counter the successes of the Hungarian revolutionary army , Habsburg Emperor Franz Joseph I asked for help from the `` Gendarme of Europe '' , Tsar Nicholas I of Russia , whose Russian armies invaded Hungary . This made Artr Grgey surrender in August 1849 . The leader of the Austrian army , Julius Jacob von Haynau , became governor of Hungary for a few months , and ordered the execution of the 13 Martyrs of Arad , leaders of the Hungarian army , and Prime Minister Batthyny in October 1849 . Lajos Kossuth escaped into exile . Following the war of 18481849 , the whole country was in `` passive resistance '' .
Because of external and internal problems , reforms seemed inevitable and major military defeats of Austria forced the Habsburgs to negotiate the Austro-Hungarian Compromise of 1867 , by which the dual Monarchy of AustriaHungary was formed . This Empire had the second largest area in Europe ( after the Russian Empire ) , and it was the third most populous ( after Russia and the German Empire ) . The two realms were governed separately by two parliaments from two capital cities , with a common monarch and common external and military policies . Economically , the empire was a customs union . The old Hungarian Constitution was restored , and Franz Joseph I was crowned as King of Hungary . The era witnessed impressive economic development . The formerly backward Hungarian economy became relatively modern and industrialised by the turn of the 20th century , although agriculture remained dominant until 1890 . In 1873 , the old capital Buda and buda were officially united with Pest , Hungary , thus creating the new metropolis of Budapest . Many of the state institutions and the modern administrative system of Hungary were established during this period .
After the Assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand in Sarajevo , the Hungarian prime minister Istvn Tisza and his cabinet tried to avoid the outbreak and escalating of a war in Europe , but their diplomatic efforts were unsuccessful . AustriaHungary drafted 9 ; million ( fighting forces : 7.8 ; million ) soldiers in World War I ( over 4 ; million from the Kingdom of Hungary ) on the side of Germany , Bulgaria and Turkey . The troops raised in the Kingdom of Hungary spent little time defending the actual territory of Hungary , with the exceptions of the Brusilov Offensive in June 1916 , and a few months later , when the Romanian army made an attack into Transylvania , both of which were repelled . In comparison , of the total army , Hungary 's loss ratio was more than any other nations of Austria-Hungary . The Central Powers conquered Serbia . Romania declared war . The Central Powers conquered Southern Romania and the Romanian capital Bucharest . In 1916 Emperor Franz Joseph died , and the new monarch Charles IV of Hungary sympathized with the pacifists . With great difficulty , the Central powers stopped and repelled the attacks of the Russian Empire .
The Eastern front of the Allied ( Allies of World War I ) Powers completely collapsed . The Austro-Hungarian Empire then withdrew from all defeated countries . On the Italian front , the Austro-Hungarian army made no progress against Italy after January 1918 . Despite great Eastern successes , Germany suffered complete defeat on the more important Western front . By 1918 , the economic situation had deteriorated ( strikes in factories were organised by leftist and pacifist movements ) and uprisings in the army had become commonplace . In the capital cities , the Austrian and Hungarian leftist liberal movements ( the maverick parties ) and their leaders supported the separatism of ethnic minorities . Austria-Hungary signed a general armistice in Padua on 3 November 1918 . In October 1918 , Hungary 's union with Austria was dissolved .
=== Between the World Wars ( 19181941 ) ===
Following the First World War , Hungary underwent a period of profound political upheaval , beginning with the Aster Revolution in 1918 , which brought the social-democratic Mihly Krolyi to power as Prime Minister . The Royal Hungarian Honvd still had more than 1,400,000 soldiers when Mihly Krolyi was announced as prime minister of Hungary . Krolyi yielded to U.S. President Woodrow Wilson 's demand for pacifism by ordering the disarmament of the Hungarian army . This happened under the direction of Bla Linder , minister of war in the Krolyi government . Due to the full disarmament of its army , Hungary was to remain without a national defence at a time of particular vulnerability . During the rule of Krolyi 's pacifist cabinet , Hungary lost the control over approx . 75 % of its former pre-WW1 territories ( 325 411 ; km ) without fight and was subject to foreign occupation . The Little Entente , sensing an opportunity , invaded the country from three sidesRomania Hungarian-Romanian War Transylvania , Czechoslovakia annexed Upper Hungary ( today 's Slovakia ) , and a joint Kingdom of Serbia-French Army coalition annexed Vojvodina and other southern regions . In March 1919 , communists led by Bla Kun ousted the Krolyi government and proclaimed the Hungarian Soviet Republic ( Tancskztrsasg ) , followed by a thorough Red Terror ( Hungary ) campaign . Despite some successes on the Czechoslovak front , Kun 's forces were ultimately unable to resist the Romanian invasion ; by August 1919 , Romanian troops occupied Budapest and ousted Kun .
In November 1919 , rightist forces led by former Austro-Hungarian admiral Mikls Horthy entered Budapest ; exhausted by the war and its aftermath , the populace accepted Horthy 's leadership . In January 1920 , parliamentary elections were held and Horthy was proclaimed Regent of the reestablished Kingdom of Hungary ( 192046 ) , inaugurating the so-called `` Horthy era '' ( Horthy-kor ) . The new government worked quickly to normalize foreign relations while turning a blind eye to a White Terror ( Hungary ) that swept through the countryside ; extrajudicial killings of suspected communists and Jews lasted well into 1920 . On 4 June of that year , the Treaty of Trianon established new borders for Hungary . The country lost 71 % of its territory and 66 % of its antebellum population , as well as many sources of raw materials and its sole port , Rijeka . Though the revision of the Treaty quickly rose to the top of the national political agenda , the Horthy government was not willing to resort to military intervention to do so .
The initial years of the Horthy regime were preoccupied by putsch attempts by Charles IV of Hungary , the Austro-Hungarian pretender ; continued suppression of communists ; and a migration crisis triggered by the Trianon territorial changes . Though free elections continued , Horthy 's personality , and those of his personally selected prime ministers , dominated the political scene . The government 's actions continued to drift right with the passage of antisemitic laws and , due to the continued isolation of the Little Entente , economic and then political gravitation towards Kingdom of Italy # Fascist regime ( 19221943 ) and Nazi Germany . The Great Depression further exacerbated the situation and the popularity of fascist politicians such as Gyula Gmbs and Ferenc Szlasi , promising economic and social recovery , rose .
Horthy 's nationalist agenda reached its apogee in 1938 and 1940 , when the Nazis rewarded Hungary 's staunchly pro-Germany foreign policy in the First Vienna Award and Second Vienna Awards , respectively , peacefully restoring ethnic-Hungarian-majority areas lost after Trianon . In 1939 , Hungary regained further territory from Czechoslovakia Slovak-Hungarian War . Hungary Tripartite Pact the Axis Powers on 20 November 1940 , and in 1941 , participated in the German invasion of Yugoslavia , gaining some of its former territories in the south .
=== World War II ( 19411945 ) ===
Hungary formally entered World War II as an Axis Power on 26 June 1941 , declaring war on the Soviet Union after unidentified planes bombed Koice , Munkacheve , and Rakhiv . Hungarian troops fought on the Eastern Front ( World War II ) for two years . Despite Battle of Uman , the Hungarian government began seeking a secret peace pact with Allies ( World War II ) after the Hungarian Second Army suffered catastrophic losses OstrogozhskRossosh Offensive in January 1943 . Learning of the planned defection , German troops Operation Margarethe on 19 March 1944 to guarantee Horthy 's compliance . In October , as the Soviet front approached and the Hungarian government made further efforts to disengage from the war , German troops ousted Horthy and installed a puppet government under Szlasi 's fascist Arrow Cross Party . Szlasi pledged all the country 's capabilities in service of the German war machine . By October 1944 , the Soviets had reached the river Tisza , and despite Battle of Debrecen , succeeded in encircling and Battle of Budapest in December .
After German occupation , Hungary Holocaust in Hungary in the Holocaust . During the German occupation in MayJune 1944 , the Arrow Cross and Hungarian police deported nearly 440,000 Jews , mainly to Auschwitz concentration camp . Nearly all of them were murdered . The Swedish Diplomat Raoul Wallenberg managed to save a considerable number of Hungarian Jews by giving them Swedish passports . Rezs Kasztner , one of the leaders of the Hungarian Aid and Rescue Committee , bribed senior SS officers such as Adolf Eichmann to allow some Jews to escape . The Horthy government 's complicity in the Holocaust remains a point of controversy and contention .
The war left Hungary devastated , destroying over 60 % of the economy and causing significant World War II casualties # endnote Hungary . In addition to the over 600,000 Hungarian Jews killed , as many as 280,000 other Hungarians were raped , murdered and executed or deported for slave labour by Czechoslovaks , Soviet Red Army troops , and Yugoslavs .
On 13 February 1945 , Budapest surrendered ; by April , German troops left the country under Soviet military occupation . 200,000 Hungarians were expelled from Czechoslovakia in exchange for 70,000 Slovaks living in Hungary . 202,000 ethnic Germans were expelled to Germany , and through the 1947 Paris Peace Treaties , Hungary was again reduced to its immediate post-Trianon borders .
=== Communism ( 19451989 ) ===
Following the defeat of Nazi Germany , Hungary became a Soviet satellite of the Soviet Union . The Soviet leadership selected Mtys Rkosi to front the Stalinization of the country , and Rkosi de facto ruled Hungary from 1949 to 1956 . His government 's policies of militarization , industrialisation , collectivization , and war compensation led to a severe decline in living standards . In imitation of Stalin 's KGB , the Rkosi government established a secret political police , the State Protection Authority , to enforce the new regime . In the ensuing purges approximately 350,000 officials and intellectuals were imprisoned or executed from 1948 to 1956 . Many freethinkers , democrats , and Horthy-era dignitaries were secretly arrested and extrajudicially interned in domestic and foreign Gulags . Some 600,000 Hungarians were deported to Soviet labour camps , where at least 200,000 died .
After Stalin 's death in 1953 , the Soviet Union pursued a programme of destalinization that was inimical to Rkosi , leading to his deposition . The following political cooling saw the ascent of Imre Nagy to the premiership , and the growing interest of students and intellectuals in political life . Nagy promised market liberalization and political openness , while Rkosi opposed both vigorously . Rkosi eventually managed to discredit Nagy and replace him with the more hard-line Ern Ger . Hungary joined the Warsaw Pact in May 1955 , as societal dissatisfaction with the regime swelled . Following the firing on peaceful demonstrations by Soviet soldiers and secret police , and rallies throughout the country on 23 October 1956 , protesters took to the streets in Budapest , initiating the Hungarian Revolution of 1956 . In an effort to quell the chaos , Nagy returned as premier , promised free elections , and took Hungary out of the Warsaw Pact .
The violence nonetheless continued as revolutionary militias sprung up against the Soviet Army and the VH ; the roughly 3,000-strong resistance fought Soviet tanks using Molotov cocktails and machine-pistols . Though the preponderance of the Soviets was immense , they suffered heavy losses , and by 30 October 1956 , most Soviet troops had withdrawn from Budapest to garrison the countryside . For a time , the Soviet leadership was unsure how to respond to developments in Hungary but eventually decided to intervene to prevent a destabilization of the Soviet bloc . On 4 November , reinforcements of more than 150,000 troops and 2,500 tanks entered the country from the Soviet Union . Nearly 20,000 Hungarians were killed resisting the intervention , while an additional 21,600 were imprisoned afterwards for political reasons . Some 13,000 were interned and 230 brought to trial and executed . Nagy was secretly tried , found guilty , sentenced to death and executed by hanging in June 1958 . Because borders were briefly opened , nearly a quarter of a million people fled the country by the time the revolution was suppressed .
==== Kdr era ( 19561988 ) ====
After a second , briefer period of Soviet military occupation , Jnos Kdr , Nagy 's former Minister of State , was chosen by the Soviet leadership to head the new government and chair the new ruling Hungarian Socialist Workers ' Party Socialist Workers ' Party ( MSzMP ) . Kdr quickly normalized the situation . In 1963 , the government granted a general amnesty and released the majority of those imprisoned for their active participation in the uprising . Kdr proclaimed a new policy line , according to which the people were no longer compelled to profess loyalty to the party if they tacitly accepted the Socialist regime as a fact of life . In many speeches , he described this as , `` Those who are not against us are with us . '' Kdr introduced new planning priorities in the economy , such as allowing farmers significant plots of private land within the collective farm system ( hztji gazdlkods ) . The living standard rose as consumer good and food production took precedence over military production , which was reduced to one-tenth of pre-revolutionary levels .
In 1968 , the New Economic Mechanism ( NEM ) introduced free-market elements into socialist command economy . From the 1960s through the late 1980s , Hungary was often referred to as `` the happiest barrack '' within the Eastern bloc . During the latter part of the Cold War Hungary 's GDP per capita was fourth only to East Germany , Czechoslovak Socialist Republic , and the Soviet Union itself . As a result of this relatively high standard of living , a more liberalized economy , a less censored press , and less restricted travel rights , Hungary was generally considered one of the more liberal countries in which to live in Central Europe during communism . In the 1980s , however , living standards steeply declined again due to Early 1980s recession to which communism was unable to respond . By the time Kdr died in 1989 , the Soviet Union was in steep decline and a younger generation of reformists saw liberalization as the solution to economic and social issues .
=== Third Republic ( 1989present ) ===
Hungary 's fall of communism to democracy and capitalism ( rendszervlts , `` regime change '' ) was peaceful and prompted by economic stagnation , domestic political pressure , and changing relations with other Warsaw Pact countries . Although the MSzMP began Hungarian Round Table Talks with various opposition groups in March 1989 , the reburial of Imre Nagy as a revolutionary martyr that June is widely considered the symbolic end of communism in Hungary . Over 100,000 people attended the Budapest ceremony without any significant government interference , and many speakers openly called for Soviet troops to leave the country . Free elections were held 1990 Hungarian parliamentary election , and the Hungarian Democratic Forum , a major conservative opposition group , was elected to the head of a coalition government . Jzsef Antall became the first democratically elected Prime Minister since World War II .
With the removal of state subsidies and rapid privatization in 1991 , Hungary was affected by a severe economic recession . The Antall government 's austerity measures proved unpopular , and the Communist Party 's legal and political heir , the Hungarian Socialist Party , won the subsequent 1994 Hungarian parliamentary election . This abrupt shift in the political landscape was repeated in 1998 Hungarian parliamentary election and 2002 Hungarian parliamentary election ; each electoral cycle , the governing party was ousted and the erstwhile opposition elected . Like most other post-communist European states , however , Hungary broadly pursued an European integration agenda , Enlargement of NATO NATO in 1999 and the European Union 2003 Hungarian European Union membership referendum . As a NATO member , Hungary was involved in the Yugoslav Wars .
In 2006 , 2006 protests in Hungary erupted after it was revealed that Prime Minister Ferenc Gyurcsny had claimed in szd speech that Hungarian Socialist Party `` lied '' to win the 2006 Hungarian parliamentary election . The popularity of left-wing parties plummeted in the ensuing political upheaval , and in 2010 , Viktor Orbn 's national conservatism national-conservative Fidesz was 2010 Hungarian parliamentary election to a parliamentary supermajority . The legislature consequently approved a Constitution of Hungary , among other sweeping governmental and legal changes . Although these developments were met with and still engender controversy , Fidesz secured a second parliamentary supermajority 2014 Hungarian parliamentary election and a third 2018 Hungarian parliamentary election .
In September 2018 , the European parliament voted to act against Hungary , under the terms of Article 7 of the Treaty on European Union . Proponents of the vote claimed that the Hungarian government posed a Democratic backsliding `` systematic threat '' to democracy and the rule of law . The vote was carried with the support of 448 MEPs , narrowly clearing the two-thirds majority required . The vote marked the first the European parliament had triggered an article 7 procedure against an EU member state . Pter Szijjrt , the Minister of Foreign Affairs ( Hungary ) , described the vote as `` petty revenge '' which had been provoked by Hungary 's tough anti-migration policies . Szijjrt alleged that the vote was fraudulent because abstentions were not counted which made it easier to reach the two-thirds majority required to pass the vote .
At the European elections in May 2019 , Viktor Orbn 's Fidesz Party secured another a sweeping victory , receiving more than 50 % of the votes .
In March 2020 , during the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic in Hungary , the Hungarian parliament passed a law granting the Government the power to rule by decree to the extent it is necessary to diminish the consequences of the pandemic , suspending by-elections and outlawing the `` spreading of misinformation '' . The Government 's special authorisation is in force until the pandemic is declared to have ended . The law was lifted on 16 June 2020.
== Geography ==
Hungary 's geography has traditionally been defined by its two main waterways , the Danube and Tisza rivers . The common tripartite division of the country into three sectionsDunntl ( `` beyond the Danube '' , Transdanubia ) , Tiszntl ( `` beyond the Tisza '' ) , and Duna-Tisza kze ( `` between the Danube and Tisza '' ) is a reflection of this . The Danube flows northsouth right through the centre of contemporary Hungary , and the entire country lies within its drainage basin .
Transdanubia , which stretches westward from the centre of the country towards Austria , is a primarily hilly region with a terrain varied by low mountains . These include the very eastern stretch of the Alps , Alpokalja , in the west of the country , the Transdanubian Mountains in the central region of Transdanubia , and the Mecsek Mountains and Villny Mountains in the south . The highest point of the area is the rott-k in the Alps , at . The Little Hungarian Plain ( Kisalfld ) is found in northern Transdanubia . Lake Balaton and Lake Hvz , the largest lake in Central Europe and the largest thermal lake in the world , respectively , are in Transdanubia as well .
The Duna-Tisza kze and Tiszntl are characterised mainly by the Great Hungarian Plain ( Alfld ) , which stretches across most of the eastern and southeastern areas of the country . To the north of the Plain are the foothills of the Carpathian Mountains in a wide band near the Slovakian border . The Kkes at is the tallest mountain in Hungary and is found here .
Phytogeography , Hungary belongs to the Central European province of the Circumboreal Region within the Boreal Kingdom . According to the World Wide Fund for Nature , the territory of Hungary belongs to the terrestrial ecoregion of Pannonian mixed forests . It had a 2019 Forest Landscape Integrity Index mean score of 2.25/10 , ranking it 156th globally out of 172 countries .
Hungary has 10 national parks , 145 minor nature reserves , and 35 landscape protection areas .
Hungary is a landlocked country .
=== Climate ===
Hungary has a Temperate climate , with generally warm summers with low overall humidity levels but frequent rainshowers and cold snowy winters . Average annual temperature is . Temperature extremes are on 20 July 2007 at Kiskunhalas in the summer and on 16 February 1940 Miskolc-Grmblytapolca in the winter . Average high temperature in the summer is and average low temperature in the winter is . The average yearly rainfall is approximately .

== Government and politics ==
Hungary is a Unitary state , parliamentary democratic , representative democracy parliamentary republic . The Hungarian political system operates under a framework reformed in 2012 ; this constitutional document is the Constitution of Hungary . Amendments generally require a two-thirds majority of parliament ; the fundamental principles of the constitution ( as expressed in the articles guaranteeing human dignity , the separation of powers , the state structure , and the rule of law ) are valid in perpetuity . 199 Members of Parliament ( orszggylsi kpvisel ) are elected to the highest organ of state authority , the Unicameralism National Assembly of Hungary ( National Assembly ) , every four years in a single-round first-past-the-post voting first-past-the-post election with an election threshold of 5 % .

The cabinet reports to National Assembly ( Hungary ) .
In 2009 Hungary , due to strong economic difficulties , had to request the help of the IMF for about 9 ; billion . The debt-to-GDP ratio of Hungary had its peak in 2011 when it stood at 83 % and decreased since then . According to Eurostat , the Government debt of Hungary amounts to 25.119 ; billion HUF or 74.1 % of its Gross domestic product in 2016 .

On Transparency International 's 2019 Corruption Perceptions Index Hungary 's public sector has deteriorated from a score of 51 in 2015 to 44 in 2019 making it the 2nd most corrupt EU member at pair with Romania and behind Bulgaria .
Following a decade of Fidesz-KDNP rule lead by Viktor Orbn , Freedom House 's Nations in Transit 2020 report reclassified Hungary from a democracy to a transitional or [ regime ] . According to the report , `` the right-wing alliance ... has gradually undermined the rule of law in Hungary and established tight control over the country  s independent institutions ... [ it ] has steadily rewritten the Hungarian constitution , and eliminated democratic safeguards statutorily embodied in the Constitutional Court , Prosecutors Office , Media Authority , and State Audit Office ... '' . It also limited parliamentary oversight , independent News media , non-governmental organizations and academic freedoms , while consolidating power around the central government .
=== Political parties ===
Since the fall of communism , Hungary has a multi-party system . The 2018 Hungarian parliamentary election took place on 8 April 2018 . This parliamentary election was the 7th since the 1990 Hungarian parliamentary election 1990 first multi-party election . The result was a victory for FideszChristian Democratic People 's Party ( Hungary ) alliance , preserving its two-thirds majority with Viktor Orbn remaining Prime Minister . It was the second election according to the new Constitution of Hungary which went into force on 1 January 2012 . The new electoral law also entered into force that day . The voters elected 199 MPs instead of previous 386 lawmakers . The current political landscape in Hungary is dominated by the conservative Fidesz , who have a near supermajority , and two medium-sized parties , the left-wing Democratic Coalition ( Hungary ) ( DK ) and liberal Momentum Movement .
The democratic character of the Hungarian parliament was reestablished with revolutions of 1989 and the end of communist dictatorship in 1989 . Today 's parliament is still called Orszggyls just like in royal times , but in order to differentiate between the historical royal diet is referred to as `` National Assembly '' now . The Diet of Hungary was a legislative institution in the Kingdom of Hungary in the Middle Ages from the 1290s , and in its successor states , Royal Hungary and the Lands of the Crown of Saint Stephen throughout the Early Modern period . The articles of the 1790 diet set out that the diet should meet at least once every 3 years , but , since the diet was called by the Habsburg monarchy , this promise was not kept on several occasions thereafter . As a result of the Austro-Hungarian Compromise of 1867 Austro-Hungarian Compromise , it was reconstituted in 1867 . The Latin term Natio Hungarica ( `` Hungarian nation '' ) was used to designate the political elite which had participation in the diet , consisting of the Hungarian nobility , the Catholic clergy , and a few enfranchised burghers , regardless of language or ethnicity .
=== Law and judicial system ===
The judicial system of Hungary is a Civil law ( legal system ) system divided between courts with regular civil and criminal jurisdiction and administrative courts with jurisdiction over litigation between individuals and the public administration . Hungarian law is codified and based on Law of Germany and in a wider sense , civil law or Roman law . The court system for civil and criminal jurisdiction consists of local courts ( jrsbrsg ) , regional appellate courts ( tltbla ) , and the supreme court ( Kria ) . Hungary 's highest courts are located in Budapest .
Law enforcement in Hungary is split among the Rendrsg and the National Tax and Customs Administration . The Hungarian Police is the main and largest state law enforcement agency in Hungary . It carries nearly all general police duties such as criminal investigation , patrol activity , traffic policing , border control . It is led by the National Police Commissioner under the control of the Ministry of Interior ( Hungary ) . The body is divided into county police departments which are also divided into regional and town police departments . The National Police also have subordinate agencies with nationwide jurisdiction , such as the `` Nemzeti Nyomoz Iroda '' ( National Bureau of Investigation ) , a civilian police force specialised in investigating serious crimes , and the gendarmerie-like , militarised `` Kszenlti Rendrsg '' ( Stand-by Police ) mainly dealing with riots and often reinforcing local police forces . Due to Hungary 's accession to the Schengen Treaty , the Police and Border Guards were merged into a single national corps , with the Border Guards becoming Police Officers .

The Catholic Church in Hungary remained strong through the centuries , and the Archbishop of Esztergom was granted extraordinary temporal privileges as prince-primate ( hercegprms ) of Hungary .
Although contemporary Hungary has no official religion and recognises freedom of religion as a fundamental right , the Hungarian constitution `` recognizes Christianity 's nation-building role '' in its preamble and in Article VII affirms that `` the state may cooperate with the churches for community goals .

=== Architecture ===
Hungary is home to the largest synagogue in Europe ( Dohny Street Synagogue ) , built in 1859 in Moorish Revival style with a capacity of 3,000 people , the largest medicinal bath in Europe ( Szchenyi Medicinal Bath ) , completed in 1913 in Modern Renaissance Style and located in the Budapest city park , the biggest building in Hungary with its length ( the Parliament building ) , one of the largest basilicas in Europe ( Esztergom Basilica ) , the second largest territorial abbey in the world ( Pannonhalma Archabbey ) , and the largest early Christian necropolis outside Italy ( Pcs ) .
Notable architectural styles in Hungary include Historicism and Art Nouveau , or rather several variants of Art Nouveau . In contrast to Historicism , Hungarian Art Nouveau is based on the national architectural characteristics . Taking the eastern origins of the Hungarians into account , dn Lechner ( 18451914 ) , the most important figure in Hungarian Art Nouveau , was initially inspired by Indian and Syrian architecture , and later by traditional Hungarian decorative designs . In this way , he created an original synthesis of architectural styles . By applying them to three-dimensional architectural elements , he produced a version of Art Nouveau that was specific to Hungary .
Turning away from the style of Lechner , yet taking inspiration from his approach , the group of `` Young People '' ( Fiatalok ) , which included Kroly Ks and Dezs Zrumeczky , were to use the characteristic structures and forms of traditional Hungarian architecture to achieve the same end .
Besides the two principal styles , Budapest also displays local versions of trends originating from other European countries . The Sezession from Vienna , the German Jugendstil , Art Nouveau from Belgium and France , and the influence of English and Finnish architecture are all reflected in the buildings constructed at the turn of the 20th century . Bla Lajta initially adopted Lechner 's style , subsequently drawing his inspiration from English and Finnish trends ; after developing an interest in the Ancient Egypt style , he finally arrived at modern architecture . Aladr rkay took almost the same route . Istvn Medgyaszay developed his own style , which differed from Lechner 's , using stylised traditional motifs to create decorative designs in concrete . In the sphere of applied arts , those chiefly responsible for promoting the spread of Art Nouveau were the School and Museum of Decorative Arts , which opened in 1896.

Hungary has renowned composers of contemporary classical music , Gyrgy Ligeti , Gyrgy Kurtg , Peter Etvs , Zoltn Kodly and Zoltn Jeney among them . One of the greatest Hungarian composers , Bla Bartk , was also among the most significant musicians of the 20th century . His music was invigorated by the themes , modes , and rhythmic patterns of the Hungarian and neighbouring folk music traditions he studied , which he synthesised with influences from his contemporaries into his own distinctive style .
Hungary has made many contributions to the fields of folk music , popular music and european classical music . Hungarian folk music is a prominent part of the national identity and continues to play a major part in Hungarian music . Hungarian folk music has been significant in former country parts that belong ;  since the 1920 Treaty of Trianon ;  to neighbouring countries such as Romania , Slovakia , Poland and especially in southern Slovakia and Transylvania ; both regions have significant numbers of Hungarians .
After the establishment of a music academy led by Ferenc Erkel and Franz Liszt Hungary produced an important number of art musicians :
* Pianists : Ern von Dohnnyi , Ervin Nyiregyhzi , Andor Fldes , Tams Vsry , Gyrgy Sndor , Gza Anda , Annie Fischer , Gyrgy Cziffra , Edward Kilenyi , Balint Vazsonyi , Andrs Schiff , Zoltn Kocsis , Dezs Rnki , Jen Jand and others .
* Violists : Joseph Joachim , Leopold Auer , Jen Hubay , Jelly d'Arnyi , Joseph Szigeti , Sndor Vgh , Emil Telmanyi , Zathurecky , Zsigmondy , Franz von Vecsey , Zoltn Szkely , Tibor Varga ( violinist ) and newcomers Antal Szalai , Vilmos Szabadi , Kristf Barti ( b . 79 ) and others .
* Opera singers : Astrid Varnay , Jzsef Simndy , Jlia Vrady , Julia Hamari , Kolos Kovts ( Bluebeard in Bartk 's Bluebeard )
* Conductors : Eugene Ormandy , George Szell , Antal Dorti , Jnos Ferencsik , Fritz Reiner , sir Georg Solti , Istvn Kertsz ( conductor ) , Ferenc Fricsay , Zoltn Rozsnyai , Sndor Vgh , Arpad Joo , dm Fischer , Ivn Fischer , Pter Etvs , Zoltn Kocsis , Tams Vsry , Gilbert Varga and others
* String Quartets : Budapest Quartet , Hungarian Quartet , Vgh Quartet , Takcs Quartet , Kodly Quartet , der Quartet , Festetics Quartet ,
Broughton claims that Hungary 's `` infectious sound has been surprisingly influential on neighboring countries ( thanks perhaps to the common Austro-Hungarian history ) and it 's not uncommon to hear Hungarian-sounding tunes in Romania , Slovakia and Poland '' .Refers to the country as `` widely considered '' to be a `` home of music '' . It is also strong in the Szabolcs-Szatmr-Bereg Szabolcs-Szatmr area and in the southwest part of Transdanubia , near the border with Croatia . The Busjrs carnival in Mohcs is a major Hungarian folk music event , formerly featuring the long-established and well-regarded Bogyiszl orchestra .
Hungarian European classical music has long been an `` experiment , made from Hungarian antecedents and on Hungarian soil , to create a conscious musical culture [ using the ] musical world of the folk song '' . `` Every experiment , made from Hungarian antecedents and on Hungarian soil , to create a conscious musical culture ( music written by composers , as different from folk music ) , had instinctively or consciously striven to develop widely and universally the musical world of the folk song . Folk poetry and folk music were deeply embedded in the collective Hungarian people 's culture , and this unity did not cease to be effective even when it was given from and expression by individual creative artists , performers and poets . '' Although the Hungarian upper class has long had cultural and political connections with the rest of Europe , leading to an influx of European musical ideas , the rural peasants maintained their own traditions such that by the end of the 19th century Hungarian composers could draw on rural peasant music to ( re ) create a Hungarian classical style . For example , Bartk collected folk songs from across Central and Eastern Europe , including Romania and Slovakia , while Kodly was more interested in creating a distinctively Hungarian musical style .
During the era of communist rule in Hungary ( 19441989 ) , a Song Committee scoured and censored popular music for traces of subversion and ideological impurity . Since then , however , the Hungarian music industry has begun to recover , producing successful performers in the fields of jazz such as trumpeter Rudolf Tomsits , pianist-composer Kroly Binder and , in a modernised form of Hungarian folk , Ferenc Seb and Mrta Sebestyn . The three giants of Hungarian rock , Ills ( band ) , Metr ( band ) and Omega ( band ) , remain very popular , especially Omega , which has followings in Germany and beyond as well as in Hungary . Older veteran underground bands such as Beatrice ( band ) , from the 1980s , also remain popular .
=== Literature ===
In the earliest times , Hungarian language was written in a Old Hungarian script runic-like script ( although it was not used for literature purposes in the modern interpretation ) . The country switched to the Latin alphabet after being Christianized under the reign of Stephen I of Hungary ( 10001038 ) .
The oldest remained written record in Hungarian language is a fragment in the Establishing charter of the abbey of Tihany ( 1055 ) which contains several Hungarian terms , among them the words feheruuaru rea meneh hodu utu rea , `` up the military road to Szkesfehrvr '' The rest of the document was written in Latin .
The oldest remaining complete text in Hungarian language is the Funeral Sermon and Prayer ( Halotti beszd s knyrgs ) ( 11921195 ) , a translation of a Latin sermon .
The oldest remaining poem in Hungarian is the Old Hungarian 'Lamentations of Mary ' ( magyar Mria-siralom ) , also a ( not very strict ) translation from Latin , from the 13th century . It is also the oldest surviving Uralic languages poem .
Among the first chronicles about Hungarian history were Gesta Hungarorum ( `` Deeds of the Hungarians '' ) by the unknown author usually called Anonymus , and Gesta Hunnorum et Hungarorum ( `` Deeds of the Huns and the Hungarians '' ) by Simon Kzai . Both are in Latin . These chronicles mix history with legends , so historically they are not always authentic . Another chronicle is the Kpes krnika ( Illustrated Chronicle ) , which was written for Louis I of Hungary .
Renaissance literature flourished under the reign of Matthias Corvinus of Hungary ( 14581490 ) . Janus Pannonius , although he wrote in Latin , counts as one of the most important persons in Hungarian literature , being the only significant Hungarian Humanist poet of the period . The first printing house was also founded during Matthias ' reign , by Andrs Hess , in Buda . The first book printed in Hungary was the Chronica Hungarorum .
The most important poets of the period was Blint Balassi ( 15541594 ) and Nikola Zrinski ( 16201664 ) .
Balassi 's poetry shows medieval influences , his poems can be divided into three sections : love poems , war poems and religious poems . Zrnyi 's most significant work , the epic Peril of Sziget ( `` Peril of Sziget '' , written in 1648/49 ) is written in a fashion similar to the Iliad , and recounts the heroic Battle of Szigetvr , where his great-grandfather died while defending the castle of Szigetvr .
Among the religious literary works the most important is the Bible translation by Gspr Kroli ( The second Hungarian Bible translation in the history ) , the Protestant pastor of Gnc , in 1590 . The translation is called the Bible of Vizsoly , after the town where it was first published . ( See Bible translations into Hungarian for more details . )
The Hungarian enlightenment took place about fifty years after the French Age of Enlightenment . The first enlightened writers were Archduchess Maria Theresa of Austria ( 17171780 ) 's bodyguards ( Gyrgy Bessenyei , Jnos Batsnyi and others ) . The greatest poets of the time were Mihly Csokonai Vitz and Dniel Berzsenyi .
The greatest figure of the language reform was Ferenc Kazinczy . The Hungarian language became feasible for all type of scientific explanations from this time , and furthermore many new words were coined for describing new inventions .
Hungarian literature has recently gained some renown outside the borders of Hungary ( mostly through translations into German , French and English ) . Some modern Hungarian authors have become increasingly popular in Germany and Italy especially Sndor Mrai , Pter Esterhzy , Pter Ndas and Imre Kertsz . The latter is a contemporary Jewish writer who survived the Holocaust and won the Nobel Prize for literature in 2002.
The older classics of Hungarian literature and Hungarian poetry have remained almost totally unknown outside Hungary . Jnos Arany , a famous 19th-century Hungarian poet , is still much loved in Hungary ( especially his collection of Ballads ) , among several other `` true classics '' like Sndor Petfi , the poet of the Revolution of 1848 , Endre Ady , Mihly Babits , Dezs Kosztolnyi , Attila Jzsef , Mikls Radnti and Jnos Pilinszky . Other well-known Hungarian authors are Lszl Krasznahorkai , Ferenc Mra , Gza Grdonyi , Zsigmond Mricz , Gyula Illys , Albert Wass , Mikls Szentkuthy , Magda Szab and Stephen Vizinczey .
=== Cuisine ===
Traditional dishes such as the world-famous Goulash ( gulys stew or gulys soup ) feature prominently in Hungarian cuisine . Dishes are often flavoured with paprika ( ground red peppers ) , a Hungarian innovation . The paprika powder , obtained from a special type of pepper , is one of the most common spices used in typical Hungarian cuisine . Thick , heavy Hungarian sour cream called tejfl is often used to soften the dishes ' flavour . The famous Hungarian hot river fish soup called Fisherman 's soup or [ is usually a rich mixture of several kinds of poached fish .
Other dishes are chicken paprikash , foie gras ] made of goose liver , [ [ prklt stew , vadas , ( game stew with vegetable gravy and Sptzle ) , trout with almonds and salty and sweet dumplings , like trs csusza , ( dumplings with fresh quark ( cheese ) cheese and thick sour cream ) . Desserts include the iconic Dobos Cake , strudels ( rtes ) , filled with apple , cherry , poppy seed or cheese , palacsinta , plum dumplings ( Kle ) , somli dumplings , dessert soups like chilled sour cherry soup and sweet chestnut puree , gesztenyepr ( cooked chestnuts mashed with sugar and rum and split into crumbs , topped with whipped cream ) . Pretzel and kifli are widely popular pastries .
The csrda is the most distinctive type of Hungarian inn , an old-style tavern offering traditional cuisine and beverages . Boroz usually denotes a cosy old-fashioned wine tavern , pince is a beer or wine cellar and a srz is a pub offering draught beer and sometimes meals . The bisztr is an inexpensive restaurant often with self-service . The bf is the cheapest place , although one may have to eat standing at a counter . Pastries , cakes and coffee are served at the confectionery called cukrszda , while an eszpressz is a caf .
Plinka is a fruit brandy , distilled from fruit grown in the orchards situated on the Great Hungarian Plain . It is a spirit native to Hungary and comes in a variety of flavours including apricot ( barack ) and cherry ( cseresznye ) . However , plum ( szilva ) is the most popular flavour . Beer goes well with many traditional Hungarian dishes . The five main Hungarian beer brands are : Borsod Brewery , Soproni , Arany szok , Kbnyai , and Dreher Brewery . In Hungary , people traditionally do not clink their glasses or mugs when drinking beer . There is an urban legend in Hungarian culture that Austrian generals clinked their beer glasses to celebrate the execution of the 13 Martyrs of Arad in 1849 . Many people still follow the tradition , although younger people often disavow it , citing that the vow was only meant to last 150 years .
Wine : As Hugh Johnson ( wine ) says in The History of Wine , the territory of Hungary is ideal for wine-making and the country can be divided to six wine regions : North-Transdanubia , Lake Balaton , South-Pannnia , Duna-region or Alfld , Upper-Hungary and Tokaj-Hegyalja . The Romans brought vines to Pannonia , and by the 5th century AD , there are records of extensive vineyards in what is now Hungary . The Hungarians brought their wine-making knowledge from the East . According to Ahmad ibn Rustah , the Hungarian tribes were familiar with wine-making long time before the Hungarian conquest of the Carpathian Basin .
Hungarian wine regions offer a great variety of styles : the main products of the country are elegant and full-bodied dry whites with good acidity , although complex sweet whites ( Tokaj ) , elegant ( Eger ) and full-bodied robust reds ( Villny and Szekszrd ) . The main varieties are : Olaszrizling , Hrslevel , Furmint , Pinot gris or Szrkebart , Chardonnay ( whites ) , Kkfrankos ( or Blaufrankisch in German ) , Kadarka , Portugieser , Zweigelt , Cabernet sauvignon , Cabernet franc and Merlot . The most famous wines from Hungary are Tokaji Asz and Egri Bikavr . Tokaji , meaning `` of Tokaj '' , or `` from Tokaj '' in Hungarian , is used to label wines from the wine region of Tokaj-Hegyalja . Tokaji wine has received accolades from numerous great writers and composers including Beethoven , Liszt , Schubert and Goethe ; Joseph Haydn 's favourite wine was a Tokaji . Louis XV and Frederick the Great tried to outdo one another when they entertained guests with Tokaji . Napoleon III , the last Emperor of France , ordered 3040 barrels of Tokaji at the French Royal Court every year . Gustav III , King of Sweden , loved Tokaji . In Russia , customers included Peter the Great and Empress Elizabeth , while Catherine the Great actually established a Russian garrison in the town of Tokaj with the aim of assuring regular wine deliveries to St. Petersburg .
For over 150 years , a blend of forty Hungarian herbs has been used to create the liqueur Unicum . Unicum is a bitter , dark-coloured liqueur that can be drunk as an apritif or after a meal , thus helping the digestion .
=== Recreation ===
Hungary is a land of thermal water . A passion for spa culture and Hungarian history have been connected from the very beginning . Hungarian spas feature ancient Rome , Greek architecture , Architecture of Turkey , and northern country architectural elements .
Because of an advantageous geographical location , good quality thermal water can be found in great quantities on over 80 % of Hungary 's territory . Approximately 1,500 thermal springs can be found in Hungary ( more than 100 just in the Capital area ) . There are approximately 450 public baths in Hungary .
The ancient Rome heralded the first age of spas in Hungary . The remains of their bath complexes are still to be seen in buda . Spa culture was revived during the Turkish Invasion and the thermal springs of Buda were used for the construction of a number of bathhouses , some of which such as ( Kirly Baths , Rudas Baths ) are still functioning .
In the 19th century , the advancement in deep drilling and medical science provided the springboard for a further leap in bathing culture . Grand spas such as Gellrt Baths , Lukcs Baths , Margaret Island , and Szchenyi Medicinal Bath are a reflection of this resurgence in popularity . The Szchenyi Thermal Bath is the largest spa complex in Europe and it was the first thermal bath built in the Pest side of Budapest . This building is a noted example of modern Renaissance style . Located on the Buda side of Budapest , the Gellrt spa is the most famous and luxurious thermal complex of the capital city .
=== Folk art ===
Ugrs ( Jumping dances ) are old style dances dating back to the Middle Ages .
Solo or couple dances accompanied by old style music , shepherd and other solo man 's dances from Transylvania , and marching dances along with remnants of medieval weapon dances belong in this group .
Karikz is a circle dance performed by women only accompanied by singing of folk songs .
Csrds are new style dances developed in the 1819th centuries . Csrds is the Hungarian name for the national dances , with Hungarian embroidered costumes and energetic music . From the men 's intricate bootslapping dances to the ancient women 's circle dances , Csrds demonstrates the infectious exuberance of the Hungarian folk dancing still celebrated in the villages .
Verbunkos is a solo man 's dance evolved from the recruiting performances of the Austria-Hungary Austro-Hungarian army .
The Legnyes is a men 's solo dance done by the ethnic Hungarian people living in the Kalotaszeg region of Transylvania . Although usually danced by young men , it can be also danced by older men . The dance is generally performed freestyle by one dancer at a time in front of a band . Women participate in the dance by standing in lines to the side , and singing or shouting verses while the men dance . Each man performs a number of points ( dance phrases ) , typically four to eight without repetition . Each point consists of four parts , each lasting four counts . The first part is usually the same for everyone ( there are only a few variations ) .
It was in the beginning of the 18th-century that the present style of Hungarian folk art took shape , incorporating both Renaissance and Baroque elements , depending on the area , as well as Persian Sassanide influences . Flowers and leaves , sometimes a bird or a spiral ornament , are the principal decorative themes . The most frequent ornament is a flower with a centrepiece resembling the eye of a peacock 's feather .
Nearly all the manifestations of folk art practiced elsewhere in Europe also flourished among the [ people Magyar ] peasantry at one time or another , their ceramics and textile being the most highly developed of all .
The finest achievements in their textile arts are the embroideries which vary from region to region . Those of Kalotaszeg in Transylvania are charming products of Oriental design , sewn chiefly in a single colour ;  red , blue , or black . Soft in line , the embroideries are applied on altar cloths , pillow-cases and sheets .
In Hungary proper , Srkz in Transdanubia and the Mezkvesd in the Great Hungarian Plain produce the finest embroideries . In the Tolna ( county ) region the women 's caps show black and white designs as delicate as lace , and give evidence of the people 's wonderfully subtle artistic feeling . The embroidery motifs applied to women 's wear have also been transposed to tablecloths and runners suitable for modern use as wall decorations .
These vessels , made of black clay , reflect more than three hundred years of traditional Transdanubian folk patterns and shapes . No two are precisely alike , since all work is done by hand , including both the shaping and the decorating . The imprints are made by the thumb or a finger of the ceramist who makes the piece .
=== Porcelain ===
Founded in 1826 , Herend Porcelain is one of the world 's largest ceramic factories , specialising in luxury hand painted and gilded porcelain . In the mid-19th century it was purveyor to the Habsburg Dynasty and aristocratic customers throughout Europe . Many of its classic patterns are still in production . After the fall of communism in Hungary , the factory was privatised and is now 75 % owned by its management and workers , exporting to over 60 countries of the world .
Zsolnay Porcelain Manufacture is a Hungarian manufacturer of porcelain , pottery , ceramics , tiles and stoneware . The company introduced the eosin glazing process and pyrogranite ceramics .
The Zsolnay factory was established by Mikls Zsolnay in Pcs , Hungary , to produce stoneware and ceramics in 1853 . In 1863 , his son , Vilmos Zsolnay ( 18281900 ) joined the company and became its manager and director after several years . He led the factory to worldwide recognition by demonstrating its innovative products at world fairs and international exhibitions , including the 1873 World Fair in Vienna , then at the 1878 World Fair in Paris , where Zsolnay received a Grand Prix .

New Zealand ( Aotearoa ) is an island country in the southwestern Pacific Ocean . It consists of two main landmassesthe North Island ( Te Ika-a-Mui ) and the South Island ( Te Waipounamu ) and more than 700 List of islands of New Zealand , covering a total area of . New Zealand is about east of Australia across the Tasman Sea and south of the islands of New Caledonia , Fiji , and Tonga . The country 's varied topography and sharp mountain peaks , including the Southern Alps , owe much to tectonic uplift and volcanic eruptions . New Zealand 's Capital of New Zealand is Wellington , and its most populous city is Auckland .
Owing to their remoteness , the islands of New Zealand were the last large habitable lands to be settled by humans . Between about 1280 and 1350 , Polynesians began to settle in the islands and then developed a distinctive Mori culture . In 1642 , the Dutch explorer , Abel Tasman , became the first European to sight New Zealand . In 1840 , representatives of the United Kingdom and Mori people chiefs signed the Treaty of Waitangi , which declared British sovereignty over the islands . In 1841 , New Zealand Colony of New Zealand within the British Empire , and in 1907 it Dominion of New Zealand ; it gained Independence of New Zealand in 1947 , and the British monarch remained the [ of state ] . Today , the majority of New Zealand 's population of 5 million is of European New Zealanders ; the indigenous Mori are the largest minority , followed by Asian New Zealanders and Pacific Islanders . Reflecting this , New Zealand 's culture is mainly derived from Mori and early British settlers , with recent broadening arising from increased Immigration to New Zealand . The Languages of New Zealand are English language , Mori language , and New Zealand Sign Language , with English being very dominant .
A developed country , New Zealand ranks highly in international comparisons , particularly in education , protection of civil liberties , government transparency , and economic freedom . It underwent Rogernomics during the 1980s , which transformed it from a protectionist to a economic liberalization free-trade economy . The service sector dominates the Economy of New Zealand , followed by the industrial sector , and Agriculture in New Zealand ; international tourism in New Zealand is a significant source of revenue . Nationally , legislative authority is vested in an elected , unicameral New Zealand Parliament , while executive political power is exercised by the Cabinet of New Zealand , led by the Prime Minister of New Zealand , currently Jacinda Ardern . Queen Elizabeth II is the monarchy of New Zealand country 's monarch and is represented by a Governor-General of New Zealand governor-general , currently Dame Patsy Reddy . In addition , New Zealand is organised into 11 Regions of New Zealand and 67 Territorial authorities of New Zealand for local government purposes . The Realm of New Zealand also includes Tokelau ( a dependent territory ) ; the Cook Islands and Niue ( self-governing states in Associated state with New Zealand ) ; and the Ross Dependency , which is New Zealand 's territorial claim in Antarctica .
New Zealand is a member of the United Nations , Commonwealth of Nations , ANZUS , Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development , ASEAN # ASEAN Plus Six , Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation , the Pacific Community and the Pacific Islands Forum .
==Etymology==
The first European visitor to New Zealand , Dutch explorer Abel Tasman , named the islands Staten Land , believing they were part of the Isla de los Estados that Jacob Le Maire had sighted off the southern end of South America . Hendrik Brouwer proved that the South American land was a small island in 1643 , and Dutch cartographers subsequently renamed Tasman 's discovery Nova Zeelandia , from Latin , after the Seventeen Provinces of Zeeland . This name was later Anglicisation to `` New Zealand '' .
This was written as Nu Tireni in the Mori language . In 1834 a document written in Mori and entitled `` He Wakaputanga o te Rangatiratanga o Nu Tireni '' was translated into English and became the Declaration of the Independence of New Zealand . It was prepared by Te W ( h ) akaminenga o Nga Rangatiratanga o Nga Hapu o Nu Tireni , the United Tribes of New Zealand , and a copy was sent to William IV of the United Kingdom who had already acknowledged the flag of the United Tribes of New Zealand , and who recognised the Declaration in a letter from Charles Grant , 1st Baron Glenelg .
Aotearoa ( pronounced in Mori and in English ; often translated as `` land of the long white cloud '' ) is the current Mori name for New Zealand . It is unknown whether Mori had a name for the whole country before the arrival of Europeans , with Aotearoa originally referring to just the North Island . Mori had several traditional names for the two main islands , including Te Ika-a-Mui ( the fish of Mui ( Mori mythology ) ) for the North Island and Te Waipounamu ( the waters of Pounamu ) or Te Waka o Aoraki ( the canoe of Aoraki ) for the South Island . Early European maps labelled the islands North ( North Island ) , Middle ( South Island ) and South ( Stewart Island / Rakiura ) . In 1830 , mapmakers began to use `` North '' and `` South '' on their maps to distinguish the two largest islands , and by 1907 this was the accepted norm . The New Zealand Geographic Board discovered in 2009 that the names of the North Island and South Island had never been formalised , and names and alternative names were formalised in 2013 . This set the names as North Island or Te Ika-a-Mui , and South Island or Te Waipounamu . For each island , either its English or Mori name can be used , or both can be used together .
==History==
New Zealand is one of the last major landmasses settled by humans . Radiocarbon dating , evidence of deforestation and mitochondrial DNA variability within Mori people populations suggest that Eastern Polynesians first settled the New Zealand archipelago between 1250 and 1300 , although newer archaeology of New Zealand and genetic research points to a date no earlier than about 1280 , with at least the main settlement period between about 1320 and 1350 , consistent with evidence based on Whakapapa . This represented a culmination in a long series of voyages through the Pacific islands . Over the centuries that followed , the Polynesian settlers developed a distinct culture now known as Mori . The population formed different iwi ( tribes ) and [ ( subtribes ) which would sometimes cooperate , sometimes compete and sometimes fight against each other . At some point , a group of Mori migrated to Rkohu , now known as the Chatham Islands ] , where they developed their distinct [ [ Moriori culture . The Moriori population was all but wiped out between 1835 and 1862 , largely because of Taranaki ( iwi ) Mori invasion and enslavement in the 1830s , although European diseases also contributed . In 1862 only 101 survived , and the last known full-blooded Moriori died in 1933.
In a hostile 1642 encounter , four of Dutch explorer Abel Tasman Abel Tasman 's crew members were killed , and at least one Mori was hit by canister shot . Europeans did not revisit New Zealand until 1769 when British explorer James Cook mapped almost the entire coastline . Following Cook , New Zealand was visited by numerous European and North American History of whaling , Seal hunting and trading ships . They traded European food , metal tools , weapons and other goods for timber , Mori food , artefacts and water . The introduction of the potato and the musket transformed Mori agriculture and warfare . Potatoes provided a reliable food surplus , which enabled longer and more sustained military campaigns . The resulting intertribal Musket Wars encompassed over 600 battles between 1801 and 1840 , killing 30,00040,000 Mori . From the early 19th century , Christian missionary began to settle New Zealand , eventually Religious conversion most of the Mori population . The Mori population declined to around 40 % of its pre-contact level during the 19th century ; introduced diseases were the major factor .
In 1788 Captain Arthur Phillip assumed the position of Governor of New South Wales of the new British colony of Colony of New South Wales which according to his commission included New Zealand . The British Government appointed James Busby as British Resident to New Zealand in 1832 following a petition from northern Mori . In 1835 , following an announcement of impending French settlement by Charles de Thierry , the nebulous United Tribes of New Zealand sent a Declaration of the Independence of New Zealand to King William IV of the United Kingdom asking for protection . Ongoing unrest , the proposed settlement of New Zealand by the New Zealand Company ( which had already sent its first ship of surveyors to buy land from Mori ) and the dubious legal standing of the Declaration of Independence prompted the Colonial Office to send Captain William Hobson to claim sovereignty for the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland and negotiate a treaty with the Mori . The Treaty of Waitangi was first signed in the Bay of Islands on 6 February 1840 . In response to the New Zealand Company 's attempts to establish an independent settlement in Wellington and French settlers purchasing land in Akaroa , Hobson declared British sovereignty over all of New Zealand on 21 May 1840 , even though copies of the Treaty were still circulating throughout the country for Mori to sign . With the signing of the Treaty and declaration of sovereignty , the number of immigrants , particularly from the United Kingdom , began to increase .
New Zealand , still part of the colony of New South Wales , became a separate Crown colony Colony of New Zealand on 1 July 1841 . Armed conflict began between the Colonial government and
Mori in 1843 with the Wairau Affray over land and disagreements over sovereignty . These conflicts , mainly in the North Island , saw thousands of imperial troops and the Royal Navy come to New Zealand and became known as the New Zealand Wars . Following these armed conflicts , large amounts of New Zealand land confiscations to meet settler demands .
The colony gained a New Zealand Constitution Act 1852 , and the 1st New Zealand Parliament met in 1854 . In 1856 the colony effectively became self-governing , gaining responsibility over all domestic matters ( except Indigenous peoples policy , which was granted in the mid-1860s ) . Following concerns that the South Island might form a separate colony , premier Alfred Domett moved a resolution to transfer the Capital of New Zealand from Auckland to a locality near Cook Strait . Wellington was chosen for its central location , with Parliament officially sitting there for the first time in 1865.
In 1891 the New Zealand Liberal Party came to power as the first organised political party . The Liberal Government of New Zealand , led by Richard Seddon for most of its period in office , passed many important social and economic measures . In 1893 New Zealand was the first nation in the world to grant all Women 's suffrage in New Zealand and in 1894 pioneered the Industrial Conciliation and Arbitration Act 1894 between employers and unions .
In 1907 , at the request of the New Zealand Parliament , King Edward VII proclaimed New Zealand a Dominion of New Zealand within the British Empire , reflecting its self-governing status . In 1947 the country Statute of Westminster Adoption Act 1947 the Statute of Westminster 1931 , confirming that the British Parliament could no longer legislate for New Zealand without the consent of New Zealand .
Early in the 20th century , New Zealand was involved in world affairs , fighting in the Military history of New Zealand in World War I and Military history of New Zealand during World War II and suffering through the Great Depression . The depression led to the election of the First Labour Government of New Zealand and the establishment of a comprehensive welfare state and a protectionist economy . New Zealand experienced increasing prosperity following the Second World War , and Mori began to leave their traditional rural life and move to the cities in search of work . A Mori protest movement developed , which criticised Eurocentrism and worked for greater recognition of Mori culture and of the Treaty of Waitangi . In 1975 , a Waitangi Tribunal was set up to investigate alleged breaches of the Treaty , and it was enabled to investigate historic grievances in 1985 . The government has negotiated Treaty of Waitangi claims and settlements with many iwi , although New Zealand foreshore and seabed controversy proved controversial in the 2000s .
==Government and politics==
New Zealand is a constitutional monarchy with a parliamentary democracy , although Constitution of New Zealand is Uncodified constitution . Elizabeth II is the queen of New Zealand and thus the [ of state ] . The queen is represented by the Governor-General of New Zealand governor-general , whom she appoints on the Advice ( constitutional ) of the Prime Minister of New Zealand . The governor-general can exercise the Crown 's prerogative powers , such as reviewing cases of injustice and making appointments of Ministers of the New Zealand Government , ambassadors , and other key public officials , and in rare situations , the reserve powers ( e.g . the power to dissolve parliament or refuse the royal assent of a bill ( law ) into law ) . The powers of the monarch and the governor-general are limited by constitutional constraints , and they can not normally be exercised without the advice of ministers .
The New Zealand Parliament holds legislative power and consists of the queen and the New Zealand House of Representatives . It also included an upper house , the New Zealand Legislative Council , until this was abolished in 1950 . The supremacy of parliament over the Crown and other government institutions was established in England by the Bill of Rights 1689 and has been ratified as law in New Zealand . The House of Representatives is democratically elected , and a government is formed from the party or Coalition government with the majority of seats . If no majority is formed , a minority government can be formed if support from other parties during confidence and supply votes is assured . The governor-general appoints ministers under advice from the prime minister , who is by Constitutional convention ( political custom ) the parliamentary leader of the governing party or coalition . Cabinet of New Zealand , formed by ministers and led by the prime minister , is the highest policy-making body in government and responsible for deciding significant government actions . Members of Cabinet make major decisions collectively and are therefore Cabinet collective responsibility for the consequences of these decisions .
A Elections in New Zealand must be called no later than three years after the previous election . Almost all general elections between and were held under the first-past-the-post voting system . Since the , a form of proportional representation called mixed-member proportional ( MMP ) has been used . Under the MMP system , each person has two votes ; one is for a candidate standing in the voter 's New Zealand electorates , and the other is for a party . Since the , there have been 71 electorates ( which include seven Mori electorates in which only Mori can optionally vote ) , and the remaining 49 of the 120 seats are assigned so that representation in parliament reflects the party vote , with the threshold that a party must win at least one electorate or 5 % of the total party vote before it is eligible for a seat .
Elections since the 1930s have been dominated by two political parties , New Zealand National Party and New Zealand Labour Party . Between March 2005 and August 2006 , New Zealand became the first country in the world in which all the highest offices in the landhead of state , governor-general , prime minister , Speaker of the New Zealand House of Representatives , and Chief Justice of New Zealandwere occupied simultaneously by women . The current prime minister is Jacinda Ardern , who has been in office since 26 October 2017 . She is the country 's third female prime minister .
Judiciary of New Zealand New Zealand 's judiciary , headed by the chief justice , includes the Supreme Court of New Zealand , Court of Appeal of New Zealand , the High Court of New Zealand , and subordinate courts . Judges and judicial officers are appointed non-politically and under strict rules regarding tenure to help maintain judicial independence . This theoretically allows the judiciary to interpret the law based solely on the legislation enacted by Parliament without other influences on their decisions .
New Zealand is identified as one of the world 's most stable and well-governed states . , the country was ranked fourth in the strength of its democratic institutions and first in government transparency and Corruption in New Zealand . A 2017 Country Reports on Human Rights Practices by the U.S. Department of State noted that the government generally Human rights in New Zealand of individuals , but voiced concerns regarding the social status of the Mori population . New Zealand ranks highly for civic participation in the political process , with 80 % voter turnout during recent elections , compared to an average of 68 % .
===Foreign relations and military===
Early colonial New Zealand allowed the British Government to determine external trade and be responsible for foreign policy . The 1923 and 1926 Imperial Conferences decided that New Zealand should be allowed to negotiate its own political treaties , and the first commercial treaty was ratified in 1928 with Japan . On 3 September 1939 , New Zealand allied itself with Britain and Declaration of war on Germany with Prime Minister Michael Joseph Savage proclaiming , `` Where she goes , we go ; where she stands , we stand . ''
In 1951 the United Kingdom became increasingly focused on its European interests , while New Zealand joined AustraliaNew Zealand relations and the New ZealandUnited States relations in the ANZUS security treaty . The influence of the United States on New Zealand weakened following protests over the New Zealand in the Vietnam War , the refusal of the United States to admonish France after the sinking of the Rainbow Warrior , disagreements over environmental and agricultural trade issues , and New Zealand nuclear-free zone New Zealand 's nuclear-free policy . Despite the United States ' suspension of ANZUS obligations , the treaty remained in effect between New Zealand and Australia , whose foreign policy has followed a similar historical trend . Close political contact is maintained between the two countries , with Closer Economic Relations and Trans-Tasman Travel Arrangement that allow citizens to visit , live and work in both countries without restrictions . there were about 650,000 New Zealand citizens living in Australia , which is equivalent to 15 % of the population of New Zealand .
New Zealand has a strong presence among the Pacific Island countries . A large proportion of New Zealand 's aid goes to these countries , and many Pacific people migrate to New Zealand for employment . Permanent migration is regulated under the 1970 Samoan Quota Scheme and the 2002 Pacific Access Category , which allow up to 1,100 Samoan nationals and up to 750 other Pacific Islanders respectively to become permanent New Zealand residents each year . A seasonal workers scheme for temporary migration was introduced in 2007 , and in 2009 about 8,000 Pacific Islanders were employed under it . New Zealand is involved in the Pacific Islands Forum , the Pacific Community , Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation , and the Association of Southeast Asian Nations Regional Forum ( including the East Asia Summit ) . New Zealand has been described as an emerging power . The country is a member of the New Zealand and the United Nations , the Commonwealth of Nations and the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development ( OECD ) , and participates in the Five Power Defence Arrangements .
New Zealand 's military servicesthe Defence Forcecomprise the New Zealand Army , the Royal New Zealand Air Force , and the Royal New Zealand Navy . New Zealand 's national defence needs are modest since a direct attack is unlikely . However , its military has Military history of New Zealand . The country fought in both world wars , with notable campaigns in Gallipoli Campaign , Battle of Crete , Second Battle of El Alamein , and Battle of Monte Cassino . The Gallipoli campaign played an important part in fostering New Zealand 's national identity and strengthened the Australian and New Zealand Army Corps tradition it shares with Australia .
In addition to Vietnam and the two world wars , New Zealand fought in the Second Boer War , the New Zealand in the Korean War , the Malayan Emergency , the Gulf War , and the War in Afghanistan ( 2001present ) . It has contributed forces to several regional and global peacekeeping missions , such as those in Cyprus dispute , Somali Civil War , Bosnian War , the Suez Crisis , Angolan Civil War , CambodianVietnamese War , the IranIraq War IranIraq border , Bougainville Campaign , Operation Astute , and the Solomon Islands # Civil war .
===Local government and external territories===
The early European settlers divided New Zealand into Provinces of New Zealand , which had a degree of autonomy . Because of financial pressures and the desire to consolidate railways , education , land sales , and other policies , government was centralised and the provinces were abolished in 1876 . The provinces are remembered in Public holidays in New Zealand and sporting rivalries .
Since 1876 , various councils have administered local areas under legislation determined by the central government . In 1989 , the government reorganised local government into the current two-tier structure of Regions of New Zealand and territorial authorities . The List of former territorial authorities in New Zealand that existed in 1975 have now been consolidated into 67 territorial authorities and 11 regional councils . The regional councils ' role is to regulate `` the natural environment with particular emphasis on Resource Management Act 1991 '' , while territorial authorities are responsible for sewage , water , local roads , building consents , and other local matters . Five of the territorial councils are Unitary authority and also act as regional councils . The territorial authorities consist of 13 city councils , 53 Districts of New Zealand councils , and the Chatham Islands Council . While officially the Chatham Islands Council is not a unitary authority , it undertakes many functions of a regional council .
The Realm of New Zealand , one of 16 Commonwealth realms , is the entire area over which the queen of New Zealand is sovereign and comprises New Zealand , Tokelau , the Ross Dependency , the Cook Islands , and Niue . The Cook Islands and Niue are self-governing states in Associated state with New Zealand . The New Zealand Parliament can not pass legislation for these countries , but with their consent can act on behalf of them in foreign affairs and defence . Tokelau is classified as a United Nations list of Non-Self-Governing Territories non-self-governing territory but is administered by a council of three elders ( one from each Tokelauan atoll ) . The Ross Dependency is New Zealand 's Territorial claims in Antarctica , where it operates the Scott Base research facility . New Zealand nationality law treats all parts of the realm equally , so most people born in New Zealand , the Cook Islands , Niue , Tokelau , and the Ross Dependency are New Zealand citizens .
==Geography and environment==
New Zealand is located near the centre of the water hemisphere and is made up of two main islands and a number of List of islands of New Zealand . The two main islands ( the North Island , or Te Ika-a-Mui , and the South Island , or Te Waipounamu ) are separated by Cook Strait , wide at its narrowest point . Besides the North and South Islands , the five largest inhabited islands are Stewart Island ( across the Foveaux Strait ) , Chatham Island , Great Barrier Island ( in the Hauraki Gulf ) , D'Urville Island ( New Zealand ) D'Urville Island ( in the Marlborough Sounds ) and Waiheke Island ( about from central Auckland ) .
New Zealand is long and narrowover along its north-north-east axis with a maximum width of with about of coastline and a total land area of . Because of its far-flung outlying islands and long coastline , the country has extensive marine resources . Its Exclusive economic zone of New Zealand is one of the largest in the world , covering more than 15 times its land area .
The South Island is the largest landmass of New Zealand . It is divided along its length by the Southern Alps . There are 18 peaks over , the highest of which is Aoraki / Mount Cook at . Fiordland 's steep mountains and deep List of fiords of New Zealand record the extensive ice age glaciation of this southwestern corner of the South Island . The North Island is less mountainous but is Volcanology of New Zealand . The highly active Taupo Volcanic Zone has formed a large North Island Volcanic Plateau , punctuated by the North Island 's highest mountain , Mount Ruapehu ( ) . The plateau also hosts the country 's largest lake , Lake Taupo , nestled in the caldera of one of the world 's most active supervolcanoes .
The country owes its varied topography , and perhaps even its emergence above the waves , to the dynamic boundary it straddles between the Pacific Plate and Indo-Australian Plates . New Zealand is part of Zealandia , a microcontinent nearly half the size of Australia that gradually submerged after breaking away from the Gondwanan supercontinent . About 25 million years ago , a shift in plate tectonic movements began to Kaikoura orogeny the region . This is now most evident in the Southern Alps , formed by Continental collision beside the Alpine Fault . Elsewhere the plate boundary involves the subduction of one plate under the other , producing the Puysegur Trench to the south , the Hikurangi Trench east of the North Island , and the Kermadec Trench and Tonga Trenches further north .
New Zealand is part of a region known as Australasia , together with Australia . It also forms the southwestern extremity of the geographic and ethnographic region called Polynesia . The term Oceania is often used to denote the wider region encompassing the Australia ( continent ) , New Zealand and various islands in the Pacific Ocean that are not included in the continent seven-continent model .

===Climate===
New Zealand 's climate is predominantly temperate Oceanic climate ( Kppen climate classification : Cfb ) , with mean annual temperatures ranging from in the south to in the north . Historical maxima and minima are in Rangiora , Canterbury , New Zealand and in Ranfurly , New Zealand , Otago . Conditions vary sharply across regions from extremely wet on the West Coast , New Zealand of the South Island to Semi-arid climate semi-arid in Central Otago and the Mackenzie Basin of inland Canterbury , and subtropical in Northland Peninsula . Of the seven largest cities , Christchurch is the driest , receiving on average only of rain per year and Wellington the wettest , receiving almost twice that amount . Auckland , Wellington and Christchurch all receive a yearly average of more than 2,000 hours of sunshine . The southern and southwestern parts of the South Island have a cooler and cloudier climate , with around 1,4001,600 hours ; the northern and northeastern parts of the South Island are the sunniest areas of the country and receive about 2,4002,500 hours . The general snow season is early June until early October , though cold snaps can occur outside this season . Snowfall is common in the eastern and southern parts of the South Island and mountain areas across the country .
The table below lists climate normals for the warmest and coldest months in New Zealand 's six largest cities . North Island cities are generally warmest in February . South Island cities are warmest in January .
===Biodiversity===
New Zealand 's geographic isolation for 80 million years and island biogeography has influenced evolution of the country 's species of fauna , fungus and flora . Physical isolation has caused biological isolation , resulting in a dynamic evolutionary ecology with examples of very distinctive plants and animals as well as populations of widespread species . About 82 % of New Zealand 's indigenous vascular plants are endemism , covering 1,944 species across 65 genus . The number of fungi recorded from New Zealand , including lichen-forming species , is not known , nor is the proportion of those fungi which are endemic , but one estimate suggests there are about 2,300 species of lichen-forming fungi in New Zealand and 40 % of these are endemic . The two main types of forest are those dominated by broadleaf trees with emergent podocarps , or by Nothofagus in cooler climates . The remaining vegetation types consist of grasslands , the majority of which are Tussock grasslands of New Zealand . New Zealand had a 2019 Forest Landscape Integrity Index mean score of 7.12/10 , ranking it 55th globally out of 172 countries .
Before the arrival of humans , an estimated 80 % of the land was covered in forest , with only tree line , wet , infertile and volcanic areas without trees . Massive Deforestation in New Zealand occurred after humans arrived , with around half the forest cover lost to fire after Polynesian settlement . Much of the remaining forest fell after European settlement , being logged or cleared to make room for pastoral farming , leaving forest occupying only 23 % of the land .
The forests were dominated by Birds of New Zealand , and the lack of mammalian predators led to some like the Kiwi ( bird ) , kakapo , weka and takah evolving flightless bird . The arrival of humans , associated changes to habitat , and the introduction of Polynesian rat , ferrets and other mammals led to the List of New Zealand animals extinct in the Holocene of many bird species , including Megafauna like the moa and Haast 's eagle .
Other indigenous animals are represented by reptiles ( tuatara , skinks and List of geckos of New Zealand ) , Leiopelmatidae , Spiders of New Zealand , insects ( wt ) and snails . Some , such as the tuatara , are so unique that they have been called living fossils . Three species of bats ( New Zealand greater short-tailed bat since extinct ) were the only sign of native land mammals in New Zealand until the 2006 discovery of bones from Saint Bathans mammal a unique , mouse-sized land mammal at least 16 million years old . Marine mammals , however , are abundant , with almost half the world 's cetaceans ( whales , dolphins , and porpoises ) and large numbers of fur seals reported in New Zealand waters . Many seabirds breed in New Zealand , a third of them unique to the country . More List of birds of New Zealand # Penguins species are found in New Zealand than in any other country .
Since human arrival , almost half of the country 's vertebrate species have become extinct , including at least fifty-one birds , three frogs , three lizards , one freshwater fish , and one bat . Others are endangered or have had their range severely reduced . However , New Zealand conservationists have pioneered several methods to help threatened wildlife recover , including island sanctuaries , pest control , wildlife translocation , fostering and ecological island restoration and other Protected areas of New Zealand .
==Economy==
New Zealand has an advanced economy market economy , ranked 14th in the Human Development Index and third in the Index of Economic Freedom . It is a [ economy ] with a Nominal value gross domestic product ( GDP ) per capita of United States dollar US $ 36,254 . The currency is the New Zealand dollar , informally known as the `` Kiwi dollar '' ; it also circulates in the Cook Islands ( see Cook Islands dollar ) , Niue , Tokelau , and the Pitcairn Islands .
Historically , extractive industries have contributed strongly to New Zealand 's economy , focussing at different times on sealing , whaling , Phormium , gold , kauri gum , and native timber . The first shipment of refrigerated meat on the Dunedin ( ship ) in 1882 led to the establishment of meat and dairy exports to Britain , a trade which provided the basis for strong economic growth in New Zealand . High demand for agricultural products from the United Kingdom and the United States helped New Zealanders achieve higher living standards than both Australia and Western Europe in the 1950s and 1960s . In 1973 , New Zealand 's export market was reduced when the United Kingdom joined the European Economic Community and other compounding factors , such as the 1973 oil crisis and 1979 oil crisis crises , led to a severe Depression ( economics ) . Living standards in New Zealand fell behind those of Australia and Western Europe , and by 1982 New Zealand had the lowest per-capita income of all the developed nations surveyed by World Bank Group . In the mid-1980s New Zealand deregulated its Agriculture in New Zealand by phasing out agricultural subsidy over a three-year period . Since 1984 , successive governments engaged in major macroeconomic restructuring ( known first as Rogernomics and then Ruthanasia ) , rapidly transforming New Zealand from a protectionism and highly regulated economy to a liberalised free-trade economy .
Unemployment peaked above 10 % in 1991 and 1992 , following the Black Monday ( 1987 ) # New Zealand , but eventually fell to a record low ( since 1986 ) of 3.7 % in 2007 ( ranking third from twenty-seven comparable OECD nations ) . However , the Financial crisis of 20072008 that followed had a major impact on New Zealand , with the GDP shrinking for five consecutive quarters , the longest recession in over thirty years , and unemployment rising back to 7 % in late 2009 . Unemployment rates for different age groups follow similar trends but are consistently higher among youth . In the December 2014 quarter , the general unemployment rate was around 5.8 % , while the unemployment rate for youth aged 15 to 21 was 15.6 % . New Zealand has experienced a series of `` brain drains '' since the 1970s that still continue today . Nearly one-quarter of highly skilled workers live overseas , mostly in Australia and Britain , which is the largest proportion from any developed nation . In recent decades , however , a `` brain gain '' has brought in educated professionals from Europe and less developed countries . Today New Zealand 's economy benefits from a high level of innovation .
===Trade===
New Zealand is heavily dependent on international trade , particularly in agricultural products . Exports account for 24 % of its output , making New Zealand vulnerable to international commodity prices and global Recession . Food products made up 55 % of the value of all the country 's exports in 2014 ; wood was the second largest earner ( 7 % ) . New Zealand 's main trading partners , , are China ( NZ $ 27.8b ) , Australia ( $ 26.2b ) , the European Union ( $ 22.9b ) , the United States ( $ 17.6b ) , and Japan ( $ 8.4b ) . On 7 April 2008 , New Zealand and China signed the New ZealandChina Free Trade Agreement , the first such agreement China has signed with a developed country . The service sector is the largest sector in the economy , followed by manufacturing and construction and then farming and raw material extraction . Tourism in New Zealand plays a significant role in the economy , contributing $ 12.9 billion ( or 5.6 % ) to New Zealand 's total GDP and supporting 7.5 % of the total workforce in 2016. International visitor arrivals are expected to increase at a rate of 5.4 % annually up to 2022.
Wool was New Zealand 's major agricultural export during the late 19th century . Even as late as the 1960s it made up over a third of all export revenues , but since then its price has steadily dropped relative to other commodities , and wool is no longer profitable for many farmers . In contrast , Dairy farming in New Zealand increased , with the number of dairy cows doubling between 1990 and 2007 , to become New Zealand 's largest export earner . In the year to June 2018 , dairy products accounted for 17.7 % ( $ 14.1 billion ) of total exports , and the country 's largest company , Fonterra , controls almost one-third of the international dairy trade . Other exports in 2017-18 were meat ( 8.8 % ) , wood and wood products ( 6.2 % ) , fruit ( 3.6 % ) , machinery ( 2.2 % ) and wine ( 2.1 % ) . New Zealand wine New Zealand 's wine industry has followed a similar trend to dairy , the number of vineyards doubling over the same period , overtaking wool exports for the first time in 2007.
===Infrastructure===
In 2015 , Renewable energy in New Zealand generated 40.1 % of Energy in New Zealand New Zealand 's gross energy supply . The majority of the country 's Electricity sector in New Zealand is generated from Hydroelectric power in New Zealand , with major schemes on the Waikato River , Waitaki River and Clutha River rivers , as well as at Manapouri Power Station . Geothermal power in New Zealand is also a significant generator of electricity , with several large stations located across the Taupo Volcanic Zone in the North Island . The five main companies in the generation and retail market are Contact Energy , Genesis Energy Limited , Mercury Energy , Meridian Energy , and Trustpower . State-owned Transpower New Zealand operates the high-voltage transmission grids in the North and South Islands , as well as the HVDC Inter-Island Inter-Island HVDC link connecting the two together .
The provision of water supply and sanitation in New Zealand is generally of good quality . Regional authorities provide water abstraction , treatment and distribution infrastructure to most developed areas .
Transport in New Zealand New Zealand 's transport network comprises of roads , including of motorways , and of railway lines . Most major cities and towns are linked by bus services , although the private car is the predominant mode of transport . The Rail transport in New Zealand were privatised in 1993 but were re-nationalised by the government in stages between 2004 and 2008 . The state-owned enterprise KiwiRail now operates the railways , with the exception of commuter services in Auckland and Wellington , which are operated by Transdev Auckland and Public transport in the Wellington Region , respectively . Railways run the length of the country , although most lines now carry freight rather than passengers . The road and rail networks in the two main islands are linked by roll-on/roll-off ferries between Wellington and Picton , New Zealand , operated by Interislander ( part of KiwiRail ) and StraitNZ . Most international visitors arrive via air , and New Zealand has List of airports in New Zealand , but only the Auckland Airport and Christchurch International Airport connect directly with countries other than Australia or Fiji .
The New Zealand Post Office had a monopoly over telecommunications in New Zealand until 1987 when Spark New Zealand was formed , initially as a state-owned enterprise and then privatised in 1990 . Chorus Limited , which was split from Telecom ( now Spark ) in 2011 , still owns the majority of the telecommunications infrastructure , but competition from other providers has increased . A large-scale rollout of gigabit-capable fibre to the premises , branded as Ultra-Fast Broadband , began in 2009 with a target of being available to 87 % of the population by 2022. , the United Nations International Telecommunication Union ranks New Zealand 13th in the development of information and communications infrastructure .
===Science and technology===
Early indigenous contribution to science in New Zealand was by Mori tohunga accumulating knowledge of agricultural practice and the effects of herbal remedies in the treatment of illness and disease . James Cook 's voyages in the 1700s and Charles Darwin 's in 1835 had important scientific botanical and zoological objectives . The establishment of universities in the 19th century fostered scientific discoveries by notable New Zealanders including Ernest Rutherford for splitting the atom , Bill Pickering ( rocket scientist ) for rocket science , Maurice Wilkins for helping discover DNA , Beatrice Tinsley for galaxy formation , Archibald McIndoe for plastic surgery , and Alan MacDiarmid for conducting polymers .
Crown Research Institutes ( CRIs ) were formed in 1992 from existing government-owned research organisations . Their role is to research and develop new science , knowledge , products and services across the economic , environmental , social and cultural spectrum for the benefit of New Zealand . The total gross expenditure on research and development ( R & D ) as a proportion of GDP rose to 1.37 % in 2018 , up from 1.23 % in 2015 . New Zealand ranks 21st in the OECD for its gross R & D spending as a percentage of GDP .
==Demography==
The 2018 New Zealand census enumerated a resident population of 4,699,755 , an increase of 10.8 % over the 2013 New Zealand census figure . As of , the total population has risen to an estimated . New Zealand 's population increased at a rate of 1.9 % per year in the seven years ended June 2020 . In September 2020 Statistics New Zealand reported that the population had climbed above 5 million people in September 2019 , according to population estimates based on the 2018 census .
New Zealand is a predominantly urban country , with % of the population living in Urban areas of New Zealands , and % of the population living in the seven cities with populations exceeding 100,000 . Auckland , with over 1 million residents , is by far the largest city . New Zealand cities generally rank highly on international livability measures . For instance , in 2016 , Auckland was ranked the world 's third most liveable city and Wellington the twelfth by the Mercer Quality of Living Survey .
Life expectancy for New Zealanders in 2012 was 84 years for females , and 80.2 years for males . Life expectancy at birth is forecast to increase from 80 years to 85 years in 2050 , and infant mortality is expected to decline . New Zealand 's fertility rate of 2.1 is relatively high for a developed country , and natural births account for a significant proportion of Replacement fertility rate . Consequently , the country has a young population compared to most industrialised nations , with 20 % of New Zealanders being 14 years old or younger . In 2018 the median age of the New Zealand population was 38.1 years . By 2050 the median age is projected to rise to 43 years and the percentage of people 60 years of age and older to rise from 18 % to 29 % . In 2008 the leading cause of premature death was cancer , at 29.8 % , followed by ischaemic heart disease , 19.7 % , and then cerebrovascular disease , 9.2 % . , total expenditure on [ care in New Zealand health care ] ( including private sector spending ) is 9.2 % of GDP .
===Ethnicity and immigration===
In the 2018 New Zealand census , 71.8 % of New Zealand residents identified ethnically as European or Pkeh , and 16.5 % as native Mori people . Other major ethnic groups include Asian New Zealanders ( 15.3 % ) and Pacific peoples ( 9.0 % ) , two-thirds of whom live in the Auckland Region . The population has become more diverse in recent decades : in 1961 , the census reported that the population of New Zealand was 92 % European and 7 % Mori , with Asian and Pacific minorities sharing the remaining 1 % .
While the demonym for a New Zealand citizen is New Zealander , the informal `` Kiwi ( people ) '' is commonly used both internationally and by locals . The Mori loanword Pkeh has been used to refer to European New Zealanders , although some reject this name . The word Pkeh today is increasingly used to refer to all non-Polynesian New Zealanders .
The Mori were the first people to reach New Zealand , followed by the early Pkeh settlers . Following colonisation , immigrants were predominantly from Britain , Ireland and Australia because of restrictive policies similar to the White Australia policy . There was also significant Dutch , Dalmatian , German , and Italian immigration , together with indirect European immigration through Australia , North America , South America and South Africa . Net migration increased after the Second World War ; in the 1970s and 1980s policies were relaxed , and immigration from Asia was promoted . In 200910 , an annual target of 45,00050,000 permanent residence approvals was set by the New Zealand Immigration Servicemore than one new migrant for every 100 New Zealand residents . In the 2018 census , 27.4 % of people counted were not born in New Zealand , up from 25.2 % in the 2013 New Zealand census . Over half ( 52.4 % ) of New Zealand 's overseas-born population lives in the Auckland Region . The United Kingdom remains the largest source of New Zealand 's immigrant population , with around a quarter of all overseas-born New Zealanders born there ; other major sources of New Zealand 's overseas-born population are China , India , Australia , South Africa , Fiji and Samoa . The number of fee-paying international students increased sharply in the late 1990s , with more than 20,000 studying in public Tertiary education in 2002.
===Language===
English is the predominant language in New Zealand , spoken by 95.4 % of the population . New Zealand English is similar to Australian English , and many speakers from the Northern Hemisphere are unable to tell the accent ( sociolinguistics ) apart . The most prominent differences between the New Zealand English dialect and other English dialects are the shifts in the short front vowels : the short- '' i '' sound ( as in `` kit '' ) has centralised towards the schwa sound ( the `` a '' in `` comma '' and `` about '' ) ; the short- '' e '' sound ( as in `` dress '' ) has moved towards the short- '' i '' sound ; and the short- '' a '' sound ( as in `` trap '' ) has moved to the short- '' e '' sound .
After the Second World War , Mori were discouraged from speaking their own language ( te reo Mori ) in schools and workplaces , and it existed as a community language only in a few remote areas . It has recently undergone a process of revitalisation , being declared one of New Zealand 's official languages in 1987 , and is spoken by 4.0 % of the population . There are now Mori language immersion schools and two television channels that broadcast predominantly in Mori . List of dual place names in New Zealand have both their Mori and English names officially recognised .
As recorded in the 2018 census , Samoan language is the most widely spoken non-official language ( 2.2 % ) , followed by `` Northern Chinese '' ( including Mandarin Chinese , 2.0 % ) , Hindi ( 1.5 % ) , and French ( 1.2 % ) . 22,986 people ( 0.5 % ) reported the ability to use New Zealand Sign Language , which became one of New Zealand 's official languages in 2006.
===Religion===
Christianity in New Zealand is the predominant religion in New Zealand , although its society is among the most secular in the world . In the 2018 census , 44.7 % of respondents identified with one or more religions , including 37.0 % identifying as Christians . Another 48.5 % indicated that they had no religion . Of those who affiliate with a particular Christian denomination , the main responses are Anglican Church in Aotearoa , New Zealand and Polynesia ( 6.7 % ) , Catholic Church in New Zealand ( 6.3 % ) , and Presbyterian Church of Aotearoa New Zealand ( 4.7 % ) . The Mori-based Ringat and Rtana religions ( 1.2 % ) are also Christian in origin . Immigration and demographic change in recent decades have contributed to the growth of minority religions , such as Hinduism in New Zealand ( 2.6 % ) , Islam in New Zealand ( 1.3 % ) , Buddhism in New Zealand ( 1.1 % ) , and Sikhism in New Zealand ( 0.9 % ) . The Auckland Region exhibited the greatest religious diversity .
===Education===
Primary and secondary schooling is compulsory for children aged 6 to 16 , with the majority attending from the age of 5 . There are 13 school years and attending State school state ( public ) schools is free to New Zealand citizens and permanent residents from a person 's 5th birthday to the end of the calendar year following their 19th birthday . New Zealand has an adult literacy rate of 99 % , and over half of the population aged 15 to 29 hold a tertiary qualification . There are five types of government-owned tertiary institutions : universities , colleges of education , Institute of technology # New Zealand , specialist colleges , and wnanga , in addition to private training establishments . In the adult population , 14.2 % have a bachelor 's degree or higher , 30.4 % have some form of secondary qualification as their highest qualification , and 22.4 % have no formal qualification . The OECD 's Programme for International Student Assessment ranks New Zealand 's education system as the seventh-best in the world , with students performing exceptionally well in reading , mathematics and science .
==Culture==
Early Mori adapted the tropically based east Polynesian culture in line with the challenges associated with a larger and more diverse environment , eventually developing their own distinctive culture . Social organisation was largely communal with families ( whnau ) , subtribes ( hap ) and tribes ( iwi ) ruled by a chief ( rangatira ) , whose position was subject to the community 's approval . The British and Irish immigrants brought aspects of their own culture to New Zealand and also influenced Mori culture , particularly with the introduction of Christianity . However , Mori still regard their allegiance to tribal groups as a vital part of Cultural identity , and Mori kinship roles resemble Hawaiian kinship . More recently , Culture of the United States , Culture of Australia , Culture of Asia and other Culture of Europe have exerted influence on New Zealand . Non-Mori Polynesian cultures are also apparent , with Pasifika Festival , the world 's largest Polynesian festival , now an annual event in Auckland .
The largely rural life in early New Zealand led to the image of New Zealanders being rugged , industrious problem solvers . Modesty was expected and enforced through the `` tall poppy syndrome '' , where high achievers received harsh criticism . At the time , New Zealand was not known as an intellectual country . From the early 20th century until the late 1960s , Mori culture was suppressed by the attempted forced assimilation of Mori into British New Zealanders . In the 1960s , as tertiary education became more available , and Urbanization urban culture began to dominate . However , rural imagery and themes are common in New Zealand 's art , literature and media .
National symbols of New Zealand New Zealand 's national symbols are influenced by natural , historical , and Mori sources . The silver fern is an emblem appearing on army insignia and sporting team uniforms . Certain items of popular culture thought to be unique to New Zealand are called `` Kiwiana '' .
===Art===
As part of the resurgence of Mori culture , the traditional crafts of carving and weaving are now more widely practised , and Mori artists are increasing in number and influence . Most Mori carvings feature human figures , generally with three fingers and either a natural-looking , detailed head or a grotesque head . Surface patterns consisting of spirals , ridges , notches and fish scales decorate most carvings . The pre-eminent Mori architecture consisted of carved meeting houses ( wharenui ) decorated with symbolic carvings and illustrations . These buildings were originally designed to be constantly rebuilt , changing and adapting to different whims or needs .
Mori decorated the white wood of buildings , canoes and cenotaphs using red ( a mixture of red ochre and shark fat ) and black ( made from soot ) paint and painted pictures of birds , reptiles and other designs on cave walls . Mori tattoos ( T moko ) consisting of coloured soot mixed with gum were cut into the flesh with a bone chisel . Since European arrival paintings and photographs have been dominated by landscapes , originally not as works of art but as factual portrayals of New Zealand . Portraits of Mori were also common , with early painters often portraying them as an ideal race untainted by civilisation . The country 's isolation delayed the influence of European artistic trends allowing local artists to develop their own distinctive style of Regionalism ( art ) . During the 1960s and 1970s , many artists combined traditional Mori and Western techniques , creating unique art forms . New Zealand art and craft has gradually achieved an international audience , with exhibitions in the Venice Biennale in 2001 and the `` Paradise Now '' exhibition in New York in 2004.
Mori cloaks are made of fine flax fibre and patterned with black , red and white triangles , diamonds and other geometric shapes . Pounamu was fashioned into earrings and necklaces , with the most well-known design being the [ a distorted human figure sitting cross-legged with its head tilted to the side . Europeans brought English fashion etiquette to New Zealand , and until the 1950s most people dressed up for social occasions . Standards have since relaxed and New Zealand fashion has received a reputation for being casual , practical and lacklustre . However , the local fashion industry has grown significantly since 2000 , doubling exports and increasing from a handful to about 50 established labels , with some labels gaining international recognition .
===Literature===
Mori quickly adopted writing as a means of sharing ideas , and many of their oral stories and poems were converted to the written form . Most early English literature was obtained from Britain , and it was not until the 1950s when local publishing outlets increased that New Zealand literature started to become widely known . Although still largely influenced by global trends ( Literary modernism modernism ] ) and events ( the Great Depression ) , writers in the 1930s began to develop stories increasingly focused on their experiences in New Zealand . During this period , literature changed from a [ [ Journalism activity to a more academic pursuit . Participation in the world wars gave some New Zealand writers a new perspective on New Zealand culture and with the post-war expansion of universities local literature flourished . Dunedin is a UNESCO City of Literature .
===Media and entertainment===
New Zealand music has been influenced by blues , jazz , country music , rock and roll and [ hop music hip hop ] , with many of these genres given a unique New Zealand interpretation . Mori developed traditional chants and songs from their ancient Southeast Asian origins , and after centuries of isolation created a unique `` monotonous '' and `` wikt : doleful '' sound . Flutes and trumpets were used as musical instruments or as signalling devices during war or special occasions . Early settlers brought over their ethnic music , with brass bands and choir being popular , and musicians began touring New Zealand in the 1860s . Pipe bands became widespread during the early 20th century . The New Zealand recording industry began to develop from 1940 onwards , and many New Zealand musicians have obtained success in Britain and the United States . Some artists release Mori language songs , and the Mori tradition-based art of kapa haka ( song and dance ) has made a resurgence . The New Zealand Music Awards are held annually by Recorded Music NZ ; the awards were first held in 1965 by Reckitt & Colman as the Loxene Golden Disc awards . Recorded Music NZ also publishes the country 's Official New Zealand Music Chart .
Public Radio in New Zealand was introduced in New Zealand in 1922 . A state-owned Television in New Zealand began in 1960 . Deregulation in the 1980s saw a sudden increase in the numbers of radio and television stations . New Zealand television primarily broadcasts American and British programming , along with many Australian and local shows . The number of List of New Zealand films significantly increased during the 1970s . In 1978 the New Zealand Film Commission started assisting local film-makers , and many films attained a world audience , some receiving international acknowledgement . The highest-grossing New Zealand films are Hunt for the Wilderpeople , Boy ( 2010 film ) , The World 's Fastest Indian , Whale Rider , Once Were Warriors ( film ) and The Piano . The country 's diverse scenery and compact size , plus government incentives , have encouraged some Film producer to shoot big-budget productions in New Zealand , including The Lord of the Rings ( film series ) and The Hobbit ( film series ) film trilogies , Avatar ( 2009 film ) , The Chronicles of Narnia ( film series ) , King Kong ( 2005 film ) , X-Men Origins : Wolverine and The Last Samurai . The New Zealand media industry is dominated by a small number of companies , most of which are foreign-owned , although the Crown entity of some television and radio stations . Since 1994 , Freedom House has consistently ranked New Zealand 's press freedom in the top twenty , with the 19th freest media .
===Sport===
Most of the major sporting codes played in New Zealand have British origins . Rugby union is considered the national sport and attracts the most spectators . Golf , netball , tennis and cricket have the highest rates of adult participation , while netball , rugby union and association football football ( soccer ) are particularly popular among young people . Around 54 % of New Zealand adolescents participate in sports for their school . Victorious rugby tours to Australia and the United Kingdom in the 188889 New Zealand Native football team and the The Original All Blacks played an early role in instilling a national identity . Horseracing in New Zealand was also a popular spectator sport and became part of the `` Rugby , Racing and Beer '' culture during the 1960s . Mori participation in European sports was particularly evident in rugby , and the country 's team performs a Haka ( sports ) , a traditional Mori challenge , before international matches . New Zealand is known for its extreme sports , Adventure travel and strong mountaineering tradition , as seen in the success of notable New Zealander Edmund Hillary . Other outdoor pursuits such as cycling in New Zealand , fishing , swimming , running , Tramping in New Zealand , canoeing , hunting , snowsports , surfing and sailing are also popular . New Zealand has seen regular sailing success in the America 's Cup regatta since 1995 . The Polynesian sport of waka ama racing has experienced a resurgence of interest in New Zealand since the 1980s .
New Zealand has competitive international teams in New Zealand national rugby union team , New Zealand national rugby league team , New Zealand national netball team , New Zealand national cricket team , New Zealand men 's national softball team , and Team New Zealand . New Zealand participated at the Summer Olympics in 1908 and 1912 as Australasia at the Olympics , before first participating New Zealand at the Olympics in 1920 . The country has ranked highly on a medals-to-population ratio at recent Games . The `` All Blacks '' , the national rugby union team , are the most successful in the history of international rugby and have won the Rugby World Cup three times .
===Cuisine===
The national cuisine has been described as Pacific Rim , incorporating the native Mori cuisine and diverse culinary traditions introduced by settlers and immigrants from Europe , Polynesia , and Asia . New Zealand yields produce from land and seamost crops and livestock , such as maize , potatoes and pigs , were gradually introduced by the early European settlers . Distinctive ingredients or dishes include lamb and mutton , salmon , kura ( crayfish ) , Bluff oysters , whitebait , pua ( abalone ) , mussels , scallops , Paphies australis and tuatua ( both are types of New Zealand shellfish ) , kmara ( sweet potato ) , kiwifruit , tamarillo and Pavlova ( food ) ( considered a national dish ) . A [ is a traditional Mori method of cooking food using heated rocks buried in a pit oven ; still used for large groups on special occasions , such as tangihanga ] .

East Timor ( ) or Timor-Leste ( ; Timr Lorosa ' e ) , officially the Democratic Republic of Timor-Leste ( Repblica Democrtica de Timor-Leste , Repblika Demokrtika Timr-Leste ) , is an island country in Southeast Asia and Oceania It comprises the eastern half of the island of Timor , the nearby islands of Atauro Island and Jaco Island , and Oecusse , an enclave and exclave on the northwestern side of the island surrounded by Indonesian West Timor . Australia is the country 's southern neighbour , separated by the Timor Sea . The country 's size is about 15,007 ; km ( 5,794 sq ; mi ) .
East Timor was colonised by Portugal in the 16th century and was known as Portuguese Timor until 28 November 1975 , when the Fretilin ( Fretilin ) declared the territory 's independence . Nine days later , it was Indonesian invasion of East Timor and Indonesian occupation of East Timor by the Indonesian National Armed Forces ; it was declared Indonesia 's East Timor ( Indonesian province ) the following year . The Indonesian occupation of East Timor was characterised by a highly violent , decades-long conflict between separatist groups ( especially Fretilin ) and the Indonesian military .
In 1999 , following the United Nations-sponsored act of self-determination , Indonesia relinquished control of the territory . As Timor-Leste , it became the first new list of sovereign states of the 21st century on 20 May 2002 and joined the United Nations and the Community of Portuguese Language Countries . In 2011 , East Timor announced its Accession of East Timor to the Association of Southeast Asian Nations of the ASEAN ( ASEAN ) . It is one of only two predominantly Christianity in Asia nations in Southeast Asia , the other being the Philippines , as well as the only country of Asia to be located completely in the Southern Hemisphere .
==Etymology==
`` Timor '' is derived from timur , the word for `` east '' in Malay language , which became recorded as Timor in Portuguese language , thus resulting in the List of tautological place names meaning `` East East '' : In Portuguese Timor-Leste ( Leste being the word for `` east '' ) ; in Tetum Timr Lorosa ' e ( Lorosa ' e being the word for `` east '' ( literally `` rising sun '' ) ) . In Indonesian , the country is called Timor Timur , thereby using the Portuguese name for the island followed by the word for `` east '' , as adjectives in Indonesian are put after the noun .
The official names under the Constitution are Democratic Republic of Timor-Leste in English , Repblica Democrtica de Timor-Leste in Portuguese , and Repblika Demokrtika Timr-Leste in Tetum .
The International Organization for Standardization ( ISO ) ISO 3166-1 in English and all other languages is Timor-Leste ( codes : TLS & TL ) , which has been adopted by the United Nations , the European Union , and the national standards organisations of France ( AFNOR ) , the United States ( ANSI ) , United Kingdom ( BSI Group ) , Germany ( DIN ) , and Sweden ( Swedish Standards Institute ) , all diplomatic missions to the country by protocol and the CIA World Factbook .
== History ==
===Prehistory===
Cultural remains at Jerimalai on the eastern tip of East Timor have been dated to 42,000 years ago , making that location one of the oldest known sites of modern human activity in Maritime Southeast Asia . Descendants of at least three waves of migration are believed still to live in East Timor . The first is described by anthropologists as people of the Vedda people-Australoid type . Around 3000 BC , a second migration brought Melanesians . The earlier Veddo-Australoid peoples withdrew at this time to the mountainous interior . Finally , proto-Malays arrived from south China and north Indochina . Hakka traders are among those descended from this final group .
Timorese origin myths tell of ancestors who sailed around the eastern end of Timor arriving on land in the south . Some stories recount Timorese ancestors journeying from the Malay Peninsula or the Minangkabau people highlands of Sumatra . Austronesian peopless migrated to Timor , and are thought to be associated with the development of agriculture on the island .
===Classical era===
Pre-colonial Timor ( pre-1515 ) , Timor was included in Indonesian/Malaysian , Chinese , and Indian trading networks , and in the 14th century was an exporter of aromatic sandalwood , slaves , honey , and wax . From the 1500s , the Timorese people had military ties with the Lues of present-day northern Philippines . It was the relative abundance of sandalwood on Timor that attracted European explorers to the island in the early 16th century . At around that time , European explorers reported that the island had a number of small chiefdoms or princedoms .
===Colonial era===
====Portuguese period ( 17691975 ) ====
The Portuguese established outposts in Timor and Maluku Islands . Effective European occupation of a small part of present-day East Timor began in 1769 when the city of Dili was founded and the colony of Portuguese Timor declared . A definitive East TimorIndonesia border between the Dutch-colonised western half of the island and the Portuguese-colonised eastern half was established by the Permanent Court of Arbitration of 1914 , and it remains the international boundary between the successor states Indonesia and East Timor , respectively . For the Portuguese , East Timor remained little more than a neglected trading post until the late nineteenth century , with minimal investment in infrastructure , health , and education . Sandalwood continued to be the main export crop with coffee exports becoming significant in the mid-nineteenth century .
At the beginning of the twentieth century , a faltering home economy prompted the Portuguese to extract greater wealth from its colonies , which was met with East Timorese resistance .
Portuguese Timor had been a place of exile for political and social opponents deported from the metropolis since the late nineteenth century . Among them a large proportion were members of the anarchist and anarcho-syndicalist movement , which until the Second World War was the most influential of the left-wing movements in Portugal . The main waves of deportations to Timor were in 1896 , 1927 , and 1931 . Some of the activists continued their resistance even in exile . After World War II , the remaining exiles were pardoned and allowed to return .
During World War II , first the Allies of World War II and later the Empire of Japan occupied Dili , and the mountainous interior of the colony became the scene of a guerrilla warfare campaign , known as the Battle of Timor ( 194243 ) . Waged by East Timorese volunteers and Allied forces against the Japanese , the struggle resulted in the deaths of between 40,000 and 70,000 East Timorese civilians . The Japanese eventually drove the last of the Australian and Allied forces out . However , Portuguese control was reinstated after the Japanese surrender at the end of World War II .
Following the Carnation Revolution , Portugal effectively abandoned its colony in Timor and civil war between East Timorese political parties broke out in 1975.
Fretilin The Revolutionary Front for an Independent East Timor ( Fretilin ) resisted a Timorese Democratic Union ( UDT ) coup attempt in August 1975 , and East Timorese declaration of independence on 28 November 1975 . Fearing a communist state within the Indonesian archipelago , the Indonesian military launched an Indonesian invasion of East Timor in December 1975 . Indonesia declared East Timor ( Indonesian province ) on 17 July 1976 . The UN Security Council opposed the invasion and the territory 's nominal status in the UN remained as `` non-self-governing territory under Portuguese administration '' .
====Indonesian occupation ( 19751999 ) ====
Indonesian occupation of East Timor Indonesia 's occupation of East Timor was marked by violence and brutality . A detailed statistical report prepared for the Commission for Reception , Truth and Reconciliation in East Timor cited a minimum of 102,800 conflict-related deaths in the period 19741999 , namely , approximately 18,600 killings and 84,200 `` excess '' deaths from hunger and illness , with an estimated figure based on Portuguese , Indonesian and Catholic Church data of approximately 200,000 deaths . The East Timorese guerrilla force ( Foras Armadas da Libertao Nacional de Timor-Leste , Falintil ) fought a campaign against the Indonesian forces from 1975 to 1998.
The 1991 Dili Massacre was a turning point for the independence cause and an East Timor solidarity movement grew in Portugal , the Philippines , Australia , and other Western countries .
Following the Fall of Suharto , an UN-sponsored agreement between Indonesia and Portugal allowed for an UN-supervised popular East Timorese independence referendum , 1999 in August 1999 . A clear vote for independence was met with a 1999 East Timorese crisis by East Timorese pro-Indonesia militia pro-integration militia supported by elements of the Indonesian military . This allowed the sending of the multinational peacekeeping force , International Force East Timor , which was formed by Australia , the Philippines , South Korea , Thailand , and New Zealand , with aid from the United States , to restore order and aid East Timorese refugees and internally-displaced persons . On 25 October 1999 , the administration of East Timor was taken over by the UN through the United Nations Transitional Administration in East Timor ( UNTAET ) , headed by Sergio Vieira de Mello . The INTERFET deployment ended in February 2000 with the transfer of military command to the UN .
===Contemporary era===
On 30 August 2001 , the East Timorese voted in their first election organised by the UN to elect members of the Constituent Assembly . On 22 March 2002 , the Constituent Assembly approved the Constitution . By May 2002 , over 205,000 refugees had returned . On 20 May 2002 , the Constitution of the Democratic Republic of East Timor came into force and East Timor was recognised as independent by the UN . The Constituent Assembly was renamed the National Parliament and Xanana Gusmo was sworn in as the country 's first President after Indonesian occupation . On 27 September 2002 , East Timor was renamed Timor-Leste , using the Portuguese language , and was admitted as a member state by the UN .
In 2006 , the United Nations sent in security forces to restore order when unrest and factional fighting forced 15 percent of the population ( 155,000 people ) to flee their homes .
The following year , Gusmo declined another presidential term , and in the build-up to the East Timorese presidential election , 2007 mid-year presidential elections there were renewed outbreaks of violence . In those elections , Jos Ramos-Horta was elected President of East Timor . In June 2007 , Gusmo ran in the East Timorese parliamentary election , 2007 and became Prime Minister . In February 2008 , Ramos-Horta was critically injured in 2008 East Timor coup attempt . Prime Minister Gusmo also faced gunfire separately but escaped unharmed . Australian reinforcements were immediately sent to help keep order . In March 2011 , the UN handed over operational control of the police force to the East Timor authorities . The United Nations ended its peacekeeping mission on 31 December 2012.
East Timor became a state party to the UNESCO World Heritage Convention on 31 January 2017.
==Politics and government==
The [ of state ] of East Timor is the President of East Timor , who is elected by popular vote for a five-year term . Although the President 's executive powers are somewhat limited , he or she does have the power to appoint the Prime Minister and veto government legislation . Following elections , the President usually appoints the leader of the majority party or coalition as Prime Minister of East Timor and the cabinet on the proposal of the latter . As [ of government ] , the Prime Minister presides over the cabinet .
The unicameral East Timorese parliament is the National Parliament ( East Timor ) or Parlamento Nacional , the members of which are elected by popular vote to a five-year term . The number of seats can vary from a minimum of fifty-two to a maximum of sixty-five . The East Timorese constitution was modelled on that of Portugal . The country is still in the process of building its administration and governmental institutions . Government departments include the Polcia Nacional de Timor-Leste ( police ) , East Timor Ministry for State and Internal Administration , Civil Aviation Division of Timor-Leste , and Immigration Department of Timor-Leste .
===Law enforcement===
The National Police of East Timor or PNTL is the national police force of East Timor , established in May 2002 by the United Nations , before sovereignty was passed to the new state , with a mandate to provide security and maintain law and order throughout the country , and to enable the rapid development of a credible , professional and impartial police service .
==Administrative divisions==
East Timor is divided into thirteen municipalities , which in turn are subdivided into 65 administrative posts , 442 sucos ( villages ) , and 2,225 aldeias ( hamlets ) .
# Oecusse
# Liqui Municipality
# Dili Municipality
# Manatuto Municipality
# Baucau Municipality
# Lautm Municipality
# Bobonaro Municipality
# Ermera Municipality
# Aileu Municipality
# Viqueque Municipality
# Cova Lima Municipality
# Ainaro Municipality
# Manufahi Municipality
Articles 5 and 71 of the 2002 constitution provide that Oecusse be governed by a special administrative policy and economic regime . Law 3/2014 of 18 June 2014 created the Special Administrative Region of Oe-Cusse Ambeno ( Regio Administrativa Especial de Oecusse , RAEOA ) .
==Foreign relations and military==
East Timor is a full member state of the Community of Portuguese Language Countries ( CPLP ) , also known as the Lusophone Commonwealth , an international organisation and political association of Lusophone nations across four continents . In each of those nations , Portuguese language is an official language . East Timor sought membership in the Association of Southeast Asian Nations ( ASEAN ) in 2007 , and a formal application was submitted in March 2011.
The East Timor Defence Force ( Foras de Defesa de Timor-Leste , F-FDTL ) is the Armed forces responsible for the defence of East Timor . The F-FDTL was established in February 2001 and comprised two small infantry battalions , a small naval component , and several supporting units .
F-FDTL 's primary role is to protect East Timor from external threats . It also has an internal security role , which overlaps with that of the National Police of East Timor ( Polcia Nacional de Timor-Leste , PNTL ) . This overlap has led to tensions between the services , which have been exacerbated by poor morale and lack of discipline within the F-FDTL .
The F-FDTL 's problems 2006 East Timorese crisis when almost half the force was dismissed following protests over discrimination and poor conditions . The dismissal contributed to a general collapse of both the F-FDTL and PNTL in May and forced the government to request foreign peacekeepers to restore security . The F-FDTL is being rebuilt with foreign assistance and has drawn up a long-term force development plan .
Since the discovery of petroleum in the Timor Sea in the 1970s , there have been disputes surrounding the rights to ownership and exploitation of the resources situated in a part of the Timor Sea known as the Timor Gap , which is the area of the Timor Sea which lies outside the territorial boundaries of the nations to the north and south of the Timor Sea . These disagreements initially involved Australia and Indonesia , although a resolution was eventually reached in the form of the Timor Gap Treaty . After the declaration of East Timor 's nationhood in 1999 , the terms of the Timor Gap Treaty were abandoned and negotiations commenced between Australia and East Timor , culminating in the Timor Sea Treaty .
Australia 's territorial claim extended to the bathymetric axis ( the line of greatest sea-bed depth ) at the Timor Trough . It overlapped East Timor 's own territorial claim , which followed the former colonial power Portugal and the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea in claiming that the dividing line should be midway between the two countries .
It was revealed in 2013 that the Australian Secret Intelligence Service ( ASIS ) planted listening devices to listen to the East Timorese government during negotiations over the Greater Sunrise oil and gas fields . This is known as the AustraliaEast Timor spying scandal .
==Geography==

The easternmost area of East Timor consists of the Paitchau Range and the Lake Ira Lalaro area , which contains the country 's first conservation area , the Nino Konis Santana National Park . It contains the last remaining tropical dry forested area within the country . It hosts a number of unique plant and animal species and is sparsely populated . The northern coast is characterised by a number of coral reef systems that have been determined to be at risk .
East Timor is home to the Timor and Wetar deciduous forests ecoregion . It had a 2018 Forest Landscape Integrity Index mean score of 7.11/10 , ranking it 57th globally out of 172 countries .
==Economy==
The economy of East Timor is a market economy , which used to depend upon exports of a few commodities such as coffee , marble , petroleum , and sandalwood . It grew by about 10 % in 2011 and at a similar rate in 2012.
East Timor now has revenue from offshore oil and gas reserves , but little of it has been spent on the development of villages , which still rely on subsistence farming . , nearly half the East Timorese population was living in extreme poverty .
The Timor-Leste Petroleum Fund was established in 2005 , and by 2011 it had reached a worth of US $ 8.7 billion . East Timor is labelled by the International Monetary Fund as the `` most oil-dependent economy in the world '' . The Petroleum Fund pays for nearly all of the government 's annual budget , which increased from $ 70 million in 2004 to $ 1.3 billion in 2011 , with a $ 1.8 billion proposal for 2012 . East-Timor 's income from oil and gas stands to increase significantly after its cancellation of a controversial agreement with Australia , which gave Australia half of the income from oil and gas from 2006.
The country 's economy is dependent on government spending and , to a lesser extent , assistance from foreign donors . Private sector development has lagged due to human capital shortages , infrastructure weakness , an incomplete legal system , and an inefficient regulatory environment . After petroleum , the second largest export is coffee , which generates about $ 10 million a year . Starbucks is a major purchaser of East Timorese coffee .
9,000 tonnes of coffee , 108 tonnes of cinnamon and 161 tonnes of cocoa were harvested in 2012 making the country the 40th ranked producer of coffee , the 6th ranked producer of cinnamon and the 50th ranked producer of cocoa worldwide .
According to data gathered in the 2010 census , 87.7 % of urban ( 321,043 people ) and 18.9 % of rural ( 821,459 people ) households have electricity , for an overall average of 38.2 % .
The agriculture sector employs 80 % of East Timor 's active population . In 2009 , about 67,000 households grew coffee in East Timor , with a large proportion of those households being poor . Currently , the gross margins are about $ 120 per hectare , with returns per labour-day of about $ 3.70 . There were 11,000 households growing Mung bean as of 2009 , most of them by subsistence farming .
In the Ease of doing business index 2013 report by the World Bank , East Timor was ranked 169th overall and last in the East Asia and Pacific region . The country fared particularly poorly in the `` registering property '' , `` enforcing contracts '' and `` resolving insolvency '' categories , ranking last worldwide in all three .
As regards telecommunications infrastructure , East Timor is the second to last ranked Asian country in the World Economic Forum 's Network Readiness Index ( NRI ) , with only Myanmar falling behind it in southeast Asia . NRI is an indicator for determining the development level of a country 's information and communication technologies . In the 2014 NRI ranking , East Timor ranked number 141 overall , down from 134 in 2013.
The Portuguese colonial administration granted concessions to the Australia-bound Oceanic Exploration Corporation to develop petroleum and natural gas deposits in the waters southeast of Timor . However , this was curtailed by the Indonesian invasion in 1976 . The resources were divided between Indonesia and Australia with the Timor Gap Treaty in 1989 . East Timor inherited no permanent maritime boundaries when it attained independence . A provisional agreement ( the Timor Sea Treaty , signed when East Timor became independent on 20 May 2002 ) defined a Joint Petroleum Development Area ( JPDA ) and awarded 90 % of revenues from existing projects in that area to East Timor and 10 % to Australia . An agreement in 2005 between the governments of East Timor and Australia mandated that both countries put aside their dispute over maritime boundaries and that East Timor would receive 50 % of the revenues from the resource exploitation in the area ( estimated at Australian Dollar A $ 26 billion , or about US $ 20 billion over the lifetime of the project ) from the Greater Sunrise development . In 2013 , East Timor launched a case at the Permanent Court of Arbitration in The Hague to pull out of a gas treaty that it had signed with Australia , accusing the Australian Secret Intelligence Service ( ASIS ) of Covert listening device the East Timorese cabinet room in Dili in 2004 . East Timor is part of the Timor LesteIndonesiaAustralia Growth Triangle ( TIA-GT ) .
There are no Patent in East Timor .
A railway system has been proposed but the current government has yet to approve the proposal due to lack of funds and expertise .
=== Tourism ===
Tourism is still of minor importance in East Timor . In 2017 , the country was visited by 75,000 tourists . In the last five years tourism has been increasing and the number of hotels and resorts has increased . The government decided to invest in the expansion of the international airport in Dili .
The risk for tourists in East Timor is medium/low , with positive factors being a low crime , the occurrence of zero terrorist attacks in the last decades and road safety . Negative factors for tourists include roads in poor condition , mainly in the interior of the country .
==Demographics==
East Timor recorded a population of 1,183,643 in its 2015 census .
The CIA 's World Factbook lists the English-language demonym for East Timor as Timorese , as does the Government of Timor-Leste 's website . Other reference sources list it as East Timorese .
The word Maubere , formerly used by the Portuguese to refer to native East Timorese and often employed as synonymous with the illiterate and uneducated , was adopted by Fretilin as a term of pride . Native East Timorese consist of a number of distinct ethnic groups , the largest Malayo-Polynesian ethnic groups are the Tetum ( 100,000 ) , primarily in the north coast and around Dili ; the Mambai people ( Timor ) ( 80,000 ) , in the central mountains ; the Tukudede ( 63,170 ) , in the area around Maubara and Liqui ; the Galoli ( 50,000 ) , between the tribes of Mambae and Makasae ; the Kemak people ( 50,000 ) in north-central Timor island ; and the Baikeno ( 20,000 ) , in the area around Pante Macassar .
The main tribes of predominantly Papuan origin include the Bunak ( 84,000 ) , in the central interior of Timor island ; the Fataluku language ( 40,000 ) , at the eastern tip of the island near Lospalos ; and the Makasae ( 70,000 ) , toward the eastern end of the island . As a result of interracial marriage which was common during the Portuguese era , there is a population of people of mixed East Timorese and Portuguese origin , known in Portuguese as mestios . There is a small overseas Chinese minority , most of whom are Hakka people # East Timor . Many Chinese left in the mid-1970s .
===Languages===
East Timor 's two official languages are Portuguese language and Tetum language . English language and Indonesian language are sometimes used . Tetum belongs to the Austronesian languages family of languages spoken throughout Southeast Asia and the Pacific .
The 2015 census found that the most commonly spoken mother tongues were Tetum language ( mother tongue for 30.6 % of the population ) , Mambai language ( Timor ) ( 16.6 % ) , Makasai ( 10.5 % ) , Tetum language ( 6.05 % ) , Baikenu ( 5.87 % ) , Kemak language ( 5.85 % ) , Bunak language ( 5.48 % ) , Tokodede ( 3.97 % ) , and Fataluku language ( 3.52 % ) . Other indigenous languages accounted for 10.47 % , while 1.09 % of the population spoke foreign languages natively .
Under Indonesian occupation of East Timor , the use of Portuguese language was banned and only Indonesian language was allowed to be used in government offices , schools and public business . During the Indonesian occupation , Tetum and Portuguese were important unifying elements for the East Timorese people in opposing Javanese culture . Portuguese was adopted as one of the two official languages upon independence in 2002 for this reason and as a link to Lusophone nations in other parts of the world . It is now being taught and promoted with the help of Brazil , Portugal , and the Community of Portuguese Language Countries .
According to the observatory of the Portuguese language , the East Timorese literacy rate was 77.8 % in Tetum , 55.6 % in Indonesian , and 39.3 % in Portuguese , and that the primary literacy rate increased from 73 % in 2009 to 83 % in 2012 . Indonesian and English are defined as working languages under the Constitution in the Final and Transitional Provisions , without setting a final date . In 2012 , 35 % could speak , read , and write Portuguese , which is up significantly from less than 5 % in the 2006 UN Development Report . Portuguese is recovering as it is now been made the main official language of Timor , and is being taught in most schools . It is estimated that English is understood by 31.4 % of the population . East Timor is a member of the Community of Portuguese Language Countries ( also known as the Lusophone Commonwealth ) and of the Latin Union .
Aside from Tetum , Ethnologue lists the following indigenous languages : Adabe language , Baikeno , Bunak , Fataluku , Galoli language , Habun language , Idat , Kairui-Midiki language Kairui-Midiki , Kemak , Lakalei language , Makasae , Makuv ' a , Mambae , Nauete language , Tukudede , and Waima ' a language Waima ' a . According to the Atlas of the World 's Languages in Danger , there are six endangered languages in East Timor : Adabe , Habu language , Kairui-Midiki , Maku ' a language Maku ' a , Naueti language , and Waima ' a language Waima ' a .
===Education===
East Timor 's adult literacy rate in 2010 was 58.3 % , up from 37.6 % in 2001 . At the end of Portuguese rule , literacy was at 5 % .
The country 's main university is the National University of East Timor . There are also four colleges .
Since independence , both Indonesian language and Tetum have lost ground as Medium of instruction , while Portuguese language has increased : in 2001 only 8.4 % of primary school and 6.8 % of secondary school students attended a Portuguese-medium school ; by 2005 this had increased to 81.6 % for primary and 46.3 % for secondary schools . Indonesian formerly played a considerable role in education , being used by 73.7 % of all secondary school students as a medium of instruction , but by 2005 Portuguese was used by most schools in Baucau District , Manatuto District , as well as the capital district .
The Philippines has sent Filipino teachers to East Timor to teach English language , so as to facilitate a program between the two countries , under which deserving East Timorese nationals with English language skills will be granted university scholarships in the Philippines .

===Religion===
According to the 2015 census , 97.57 % of the population is Roman Catholic ; 1.96 % Protestant ; 0.24 % Muslim ; 0.08 % Traditional ; 0.05 % Buddhist ; 0.02 % Hindu , and 0.08 % other religions . A 2016 survey conducted by the Demographic and Health Survey programme showed that Catholics made up 98.3 % of the population , Protestants 1.2 % , and Muslims 0.3 % .
The number of churches has grown from 100 in 1974 to over 800 in 1994 , with Church membership having grown considerably under Indonesian rule as Pancasila Indonesia , Indonesia 's state ideology , requires all citizens to believe in one God and does not recognise traditional beliefs . East Timorese animist belief systems did not fit with Constitution of Indonesia Indonesia 's constitutional monotheism , resulting in mass conversions to Christianity . Portuguese clergy were replaced with Indonesian priests and Latin language and Portuguese language Mass in the Catholic Church was replaced by Indonesian language mass . While just 20 % of East Timorese called themselves Catholics at the time of the 1975 invasion , the figure surged to reach 95 % by the end of the first decade after the invasion . In rural areas , Roman Catholicism is Religious syncretism with local animist beliefs . With over 95 % Catholic population , East Timor is currently the second Catholic Church by country in the world , after the Vatican City .
The number of Protestants and Muslims declined significantly after September 1999 because these groups were disproportionately represented among supporters of integration with Indonesia and among the Indonesian civil servants assigned to work in the province from other parts of Indonesia , many of whom left the country in 1999 . There are also small Protestant and Muslim communities . The Indonesian National Armed Forces formerly stationed in the country included a significant number of Protestants , who played a major role in establishing Protestant churches in the territory . Fewer than half of those congregations existed after September 1999 , and many Protestants were among those who remained in West Timor . The Assemblies of God is the largest and most active of the Protestant denominations .
While the Constitution of East Timor enshrines the principles of freedom of religion and separation of church and state in Section 45 Comma 1 , it also acknowledges `` the participation of the Catholic Church in the process of national liberation '' in its preamble ( although this has no legal value ) . Upon independence , the country joined the Philippines to become the only two predominantly Roman Catholic states in Asia , although nearby parts of eastern Indonesia such as West Timor and Flores also have Roman Catholic majorities .
The Roman Catholic Church divides East Timor into List of Roman Catholic dioceses in East Timor : the Roman Catholic Diocese of Dli , the Roman Catholic Diocese of Baucau , and the Roman Catholic Diocese of Maliana .
==Culture==
The culture of East Timor reflects numerous influences , including Portuguese , Roman Catholic and Indonesian , on Timor 's Indigenous peoples Austronesian people and Melanesian cultures . East Timorese culture is heavily influenced by Austronesian legends . For example , East Timorese creation myth has it that an ageing crocodile transformed into the island of Timor as part of debt repayment to a young boy who had helped the crocodile when it was sick . As a result , the island is shaped like a crocodile and the boy 's descendants are the native East Timorese who inhabit it . The phrase `` leaving the crocodile '' refers to the pained exile of East Timorese from their island . East Timor is currently finalising its dossiers needed for nominations in the UNESCO World Heritage List , UNESCO Intangible Cultural Heritage Lists , UNESCO Creative Cities Network , UNESCO Global Geoparks Network , and UNESCO Biosphere Reserve Network . The country currently has one document in the UNESCO Memory of the World Register , namely , On the Birth of a Nation : Turning points .
===Arts===
There is also a strong tradition of poetry in the country . Prime Minister Xanana Gusmo , for example , is a distinguished poet , earning the moniker `` poet warrior '' .
Architecturally , Portuguese-style buildings can be found , along with the traditional totem houses of the eastern region . These are known as uma lulik ( `` sacred houses '' ) in Tetum and lee teinu ( `` legged houses '' ) in Fataluku . Craftsmanship and the weaving of traditional scarves ( tais ) is also widespread .
An extensive collection of Timorese audiovisual material is held at the National Film and Sound Archive . These holdings have been identified in a document titled The NFSA Timor-Leste Collection Profile , which features catalogue entries and essays for a total of 795 NFSA-held moving images , recorded sound and documentation works that have captured the history and culture of East Timor since the early 20th century . The NFSA is working with the East Timorese government to ensure that all of this material can be used and accessed by the people of that country .
===Cinema and TV drama===
In 2009 and 2010 , East Timor was the setting for the Australian film Balibo ( film ) and the South Korean film A Barefoot Dream . In 2013 , the first East Timorese feature film , Beatriz 's War , was released . Two further feature-length films , Abdul & Jos and Ema Nudar Umanu , were respectively released on 30 July 2017 through the television network of East Timor Broadcasting Service and on 16 August 2018 at the Melbourne International Film Festival . In 2010 , the first East Timorese TV drama , Suku Hali was released .
===Cuisine===
The cuisine of East Timor consists of regional popular foods such as pork , fish , basil , tamarind , legumes , corn , rice , root vegetables , and tropical fruit . East Timorese cuisine has influences from Southeast Asian cuisine and from Portuguese cuisine from its colonisation by Portugal . Flavours and ingredients from other former Portuguese colonies can be found due to the centuries-old Portuguese presence on the island . Due to the East and West combination of East Timor 's cuisine , it developed features related to Filipino cuisine , which also experienced an eastwest culinary combination .

Portugal ( ) , officially the Portuguese Republic ( Repblica Portuguesa links=no ) , is a country located on the Iberian Peninsula , in Southern Europe . It is the westernmost sovereign state in mainland Europe , being bordered to the west and south by the Atlantic Ocean and to the north and east by Spain . Its territory also includes the Atlantic archipelagos of the Azores and Madeira , both Autonomous regions of Portugal with their own regional governments . The official and national language is Portuguese language .
Portugal is the oldest nation state on the Iberian Peninsula and one of the oldest in Europe , its territory having been continuously settled , invaded and fought over since Prehistoric Iberia . It was inhabited by pre-Celtic and Celts peoples , visited by Phoenicians-Carthaginians , Ancient Greeks and ruled by the Roman Republic , who were followed by the invasions of the Suebi and Visigoths Germanic peoples . After the Muslim conquest of the Iberian Peninsula , most of its territory was part of Al-Andalus . Portugal as a country was established during the early Christian Reconquista . Founded in 868 , the County of Portugal gained prominence after the Battle of So Mamede ( 1128 ) . The Kingdom of Portugal was later proclaimed following the Battle of Ourique ( 1139 ) , and independence from Kingdom of Len was recognized by the Treaty of Zamora ( 1143 ) .
In the 15th and 16th centuries , Portugal established the Portuguese Empire , becoming one of the world 's major economic , political and military Education superpower . During this period , today referred to as the Age of Discovery , Portuguese explorers pioneered maritime exploration with the discovery of what would become Colonial Brazil ( 1500 ) . During this time Portugal monopolized the spice trade , Treaty of Tordesillas , and the empire expanded with military campaigns in Portuguese presence in Asia . However , events such as the 1755 Lisbon earthquake , the country 's occupation during the Napoleonic Wars , and the independence of Brazil ( 1822 ) erased to a great extent Economic history of Portugal Portugal 's prior opulence .
After the 5 October 1910 revolution deposed the monarchy , the democratic but unstable First Portuguese Republic was established , later being superseded by the Estado Novo ( Portugal ) authoritarian regime . Democracy was restored after the Carnation Revolution ( 1974 ) , ending the Portuguese Colonial War . Shortly after , independence was granted to almost all Portuguese-speaking African countries . The Transfer of sovereignty over Macau ( 1999 ) marked the end of what can be considered one of the longest-lived colonial empires in history .
Portugal has left a profound cultural , architectural and linguistic influence Evolution of the Portuguese Empire , with a legacy of around 250 million Lusophone , and many Portuguese-based creole languages Portuguese-based creoles . It is a developed country with an Developed country # IMF advanced economies and high living standards . Additionally , it is highly placed in rankings of World Index of Moral Freedom ( 2nd ) , Global Peace Index ( 3rd ) , democracy ( 7th ) , Press Freedom Index ( 10th ) , List of countries by Fragile States Index ( 14th ) , Social Progress Index ( 21th ) , and Legatum Prosperity Index ( 27th ) . A member of the United Nations , the European Union , the Schengen Area and the Council of Europe ( CoE ) , Portugal was also one of the founding members of NATO , the eurozone , the OECD , and the Community of Portuguese Language Countries .
== Etymology ==
The word Portugal derives from the Ancient Rome-Celts place name Portus Cale ; a city where present-day Vila Nova de Gaia now stands , at the mouth of the River Douro in the north of what is now Portugal . The name of the city is from the Latin word for port or harbour , portus , but the second element of Portus Cale is less clear . The mainstream explanation for the name is that it is an ethnonym derived from the Castro culture , also known as the Callaeci , Gallaeci or Gallaecia , who occupied the north-west of the Iberian Peninsula . The names Cale and Callaici are the origin of today 's Vila Nova de Gaia and Galicia ( Spain ) .
Another theory proposes that Cale or Calle is a derivation of the Celtic word for port , like the Irish language caladh or Scottish Gaelic cala . These explanations , would require the pre-Roman language of the area to have been a branch of Q-Celtic , which is not generally accepted because the region 's pre-Roman language was Gallaecian Celtic , usually considered P-Celtic . However , scholars like Jean Markale and Tranoy propose that the Celtic branches all share the same origin , and placenames such as Cale , Gal , Gaia , Calais , Galatia , Galicia , Gaelic , Gael , Gaul , Wales , Cornwall , Wallonia and others all stem from one linguistic root .
Another theory has it that Cala was the name of a Celtic goddess ( drawing a comparison with the Gaelic languages Cailleach , a supernatural hag ) . Some French scholars believe the name may have come from `` Portus Gallus '' , the port of the Gauls or Celts .
Around 200 BC , the Romans took the Iberian Peninsula from the Ancient Carthage during the Second Punic War . In the process they conquered Cale , renaming it Portus Cale ( `` Port of Cale '' ) and incorporating it in the province of Gaelicia with its capital in Bracara Augusta ( modern day Braga , Portugal ) . During the Middle Ages , the region around Portus Cale became known by the Suebi and Visigoths as Portucale . The name Portucale evolved into Portugale during the 7th and 8th centuries , and by the 9th century , that term was used extensively to refer to the region between the rivers Douro and Minho River . By the 11th and 12th centuries , Portugale , Portugallia , Portvgallo or Portvgalliae was already referred to as Portugal .
The 14th century Middle French name for the country , Portingal , which added an intrusive /n/ sound through the process of excrescence ( phonology ) , spread to Middle English . Middle English variant spellings included Portingall , Portingale , Portyngale and Portingaill . The spelling Portyngale is found in Chaucer 's Epilogue to the Nun 's Priest 's Tale . These variants survive in the Torrent of Portyngale , a Middle English romance composed around 1400 , and `` Old Robin of Portingale '' , an English Child ballad . Portingal and variants were also used in Scots language and survive in the Cornish language name for the country , : kw : Portyngal .
== History ==
=== Prehistory ===
The early history of Portugal is shared with the rest of the Iberian Peninsula located in Southwestern Europe . The name of Portugal derives from the joined Romano-Celtic name Portus Cale . The region was Pre-Roman peoples of the Iberian Peninsula by Pre-Celts and Celts , giving origin to peoples like the Gallaeci , Lusitanians , Celtici and Cynetes ( also known as Conii ) , visited by Phoenicians-Carthaginians and Ancient Greeks , was incorporated in the Roman Republic dominions as Lusitania and part of Gallaecia , after 45 BC until 298 AD .
The region of present-day Portugal was inhabited by Neanderthals and then by Homo sapiens , who roamed the border-less region of the northern Iberian peninsula . These were subsistence societies and although they did not establish prosperous settlements , they did form organized societies . Neolithic Portugal experimented with domestication of herding animals , the raising of some cereal crops and fluvial or marine fishing .
It is believed by some scholars that early in the first millennium BC , several waves of Celts invaded Portugal from Central Europe and inter-married with the local populations , forming Pre-Roman peoples of the Iberian Peninsula.Another theory suggests that Celts inhabited Western Iberia / Portugal well before any large Celtic migrations from Central Europe . In addition , a number of linguists expert in ancient Celtic have presented compelling evidence that the Tartessian language , once spoken in parts of SW Spain and SW Portugal , is at least proto-Celtic in structure .
Modern archaeology and research shows a Portuguese root to the Celts in Portugal and elsewhere . During that period and until the Roman invasions , the Castro culture ( a variation of the Urnfield culture also known as Urnenfelderkultur ) was prolific in Portugal and modern Galicia .
This culture , together with the surviving elements of the Atlantic megalithic culture and the contributions that come from the more Western Mediterranean cultures , ended up in what has been called the Cultura Castreja or Castro Culture . This designation refers to the characteristic Celtic populations called 'dn ' , 'din ' or 'don ' in Goidelic languages and that the Romans called castrae in their chronicles .
Based on the Roman chronicles about the Callaeci peoples , along with the Lebor Gabla renn narrations and the interpretation of the abundant archaeological remains throughout the northern half of Portugal and Galicia , it is possible to infer that there was a matriarchal society , with a military and religious aristocracy probably of the feudal type . The figures of maximum authority were the chieftain ( chefe tribal ) , of military type and with authority in his Castro or clan , and the druid , mainly referring to medical and religious functions that could be common to several castros . The Celtic cosmogony remained homogeneous due to the ability of the druids to meet in councils with the druids of other areas , which ensured the transmission of knowledge and the most significant events .
The first documentary references to Castro society are provided by chroniclers of Roman military campaigns such as Strabo , Herodotus and Pliny the Elder among others , about the social organization , and describing the inhabitants of these territories , the Gallaecia as :
`` A group of barbarians who spend the day fighting and the night eating , drinking and dancing under the moon . ''
There were other similar tribes , and chief among them were the Lusitanians ; the core area of these people lay in inland central Portugal , while numerous other related tribes existed such as the Celtici , and the Cynetes . Among the tribes or sub-divisions were the Bracari , Coelerni , Equaesi , Grovii , Interamici , Leuni , Luanqui , Limici , Narbasi , Nemetati , Paesuri , Quaquerni , Seurbi , Tamagani , Tapoli , Turduli , Turduli Veteres , Turdulorum Oppida , Turodi , and Zoelae . A few small , semi-permanent , commercial coastal settlements ( such as Tavira Municipality ) were also founded in the Algarve region by PhoeniciansCarthaginians .
=== Roman Lusitania and Gallaecia ===
Romans first invaded the Iberian Peninsula in 219 BC . The Carthaginians , Rome 's adversary in the Punic Wars , were expelled from their coastal colonies . During the last days of Julius Caesar , almost the entire peninsula was annexed to the Roman Republic .
The Roman conquest of what is now part of Portugal took almost two hundred years and took many lives of young soldiers and
the lives of those who were sentenced to a certain death in the slave mines when not sold as slaves to other parts of the empire . It suffered a severe setback in 155 BC , when a Lusitanian War began in the north . The Lusitanians and other native tribes , under the leadership of Viriathus , wrested control of all of western Iberia .
Rome sent numerous legions and its best generals to Lusitania to quell the rebellion , but to no avail  the Lusitanians kept conquering territory . The Roman leaders decided to change their strategy . They bribed Viriathus 's allies to kill him . In 139 BC , Viriathus was assassinated and Tautalus became leader of the Lusitanians .
Rome installed a colonial regime . The complete Romanization of Lusitania only took place in the Visigothic era .
In 27 BC , Lusitania gained the status of Roman province . Later , a northern province of Lusitania was formed , known as Gallaecia , with capital in Bracara Augusta , today 's Braga .
There are still many ruins of castros ( [ forts ] ) throughout modern Portugal and remains of the Castro culture .
Some urban remains are quite large , like Conmbriga and Mirbriga . The former , beyond being one of the largest Roman Empire settlements in Portugal , is also classified as a Monuments of Portugal . Conmbriga lies from Coimbra , which in turn was the ancient Aeminium . The site also has a museum that displays objects found by archaeologists during their excavations .
Several works of engineering , such as baths , temples , bridges , roads , circuses , theatres and laymen 's homes are preserved throughout the country . Coins , some coined in Lusitanian land , as well as numerous pieces of ceramics , were also found . Contemporary historians include Paulus Orosius ( c. 375418 ) and Hydatius ( c. 400469 ) , bishop of Aquae Flaviae , who reported on the final years of the Roman rule and arrival of the Germanic peoples .
=== Germanic kingdoms : Suebi and Visigoths ===
In the early 5th century , Germanic peoples , namely the Suebi and the Vandals ( Silingi and Hasdingi ) together with their allies , the Sarmatians and Alans invaded the Iberian Peninsula where they would form their kingdom . The Kingdom of the Suebi was the Germanic post-Roman kingdom , established in the former Roman provinces of Gallaecia-Lusitania . 5th-century vestiges of Alans settlements were found in Alenquer Municipality , Portugal ( from old Germanic Alan kerk , temple of the Alans ) , Coimbra and Lisbon .
About 410 and during the 6th century it became a formally declared Kingdom of the Suebi , where king Hermeric made a peace treaty with the Gallaecians before passing his domains to Rechila , his son . In 448 Rechila died , leaving the state in expansion to Rechiar .
After the defeat against the Visigoths , the Suebian kingdom was divided , with Frantan and Aguiulfo ruling simultaneously . Both reigned from 456 to 457 , the year in which Maldras ( 457459 ) reunified the kingdom . He was assassinated after a failed Roman-Visigothic conspiracy .
Although the conspiracy did not achieve its true purposes , the Suebian Kingdom was again divided between two kings :
Frumar ( Frumario 459463 ) and Remismund ( Remismundo , son of Maldras ) ( 459469 ) who would re-reunify his father 's kingdom in 463 . He would be forced to adopt Arianism in 465 due to the Visigoth influence .
By the year 500 , the Visigothic Kingdom had been installed in Iberia , it was based in Toledo , Spain and advancing westwards . They became a threat to the Suebian rule .
After the death of Remismund in 469 a dark period set in , where virtually all written texts and accounts disappear . This period lasted until 550 . The only thing known about this period is that Theodemund ( Teodemundo ) most probably ruled the Suebians .
The dark period ended with the reign of Karriarico ( 550559 ) who reinstalled Catholic Church in 550 . He was succeeded by Theodemir ( Suebian king ) ( 559570 ) during whose reign the 1st Council of Braga ( 561 ) was held .
The councils represented an advance in the organization of the territory ( paroeciam suevorum ( Suebian parish ) and the Christianization of the pagan population ( De correctione rusticorum ) under the auspices of Saint Martin of Braga ( So Martinho de Braga ) .
After the death of Teodomiro , Miro ( Suebian king ) ( 570583 ) was his successor . During his reign , the 2nd Council of Braga ( 572 ) was held .
The Visigothic civil war began in 577 . Miro intervened . Later in 583 he also organized an unsuccessful expedition to reconquer Seville . During the return from this failed operation Miro died .
In the Suebian Kingdom many internal struggles continued to take place . Eborico ( Eurico , 583584 ) was dethroned by Andeca ( Audeca 584585 ) , who failed to prevent the Visigothic invasion led by Leovigildo . The Visigothic invasion , completed in 585 , turned the once rich and fertile kingdom of the Suebi into the sixth province of the Gothic kingdom .
Leovigild was crowned King of Gallaecia , Hispania and Gallia Narbonensis .
For the next 300 years and by the year 700 , the entire Iberian Peninsula was ruled by the Visigoths . Under the Visigoths , Gallaecia was a well-defined space governed by a doge of its own . Doges at this time were related to the monarchy acted as princes in all matters . Both 'governors ' Wamba ( king ) and Wittiza ( Vitiza ) acted as doge ( they would later become kings in Toledo ) . These two became known as the 'vitizians ' , who headquartered in the northwest and called on the Arab invaders from the South to be their allies in the struggle for power in 711 . King Roderic ( Rodrigo ) was killed while opposing this invasion , thus becoming the last Visigothic king of Iberia . From the various Germanic groups who settled in Western Iberia , the Suebi left the strongest lasting cultural legacy in what is today Portugal , Galicia and western fringes of Asturias .
According to Dan Stanislawski , the Portuguese way of living in regions North of the Tagus is mostly inherited from the Suebi , in which small farms prevail , distinct from the large properties of Southern Portugal .
Bracara Augusta , the modern city of Braga and former capital of Gallaecia , became the capital of the Suebi . Apart from cultural and some linguistic traces , the Suebians left the highest Germanic genetic contribution of the Iberian Peninsula in Portugal and Galicia . Paulus Orosius , at that time resident in Hispania , shows a rather pacific initial settlement , the newcomers working their lands or serving as bodyguards of the locals .
Another Germanic group that accompanied the Suebi and settled in Gallaecia were the Buri ( Germanic tribe ) . They settled in the region between the rivers Cvado River and Homem , in the area known as Terras de Bouro ( Lands of the Buri ) .
=== Islamic period and the Reconquista ===
Today 's continental Portugal , along with most of modern Spain , was part of al-Andalus between 726 and 1249 , following the Umayyad Caliphate conquest of the Iberian Peninsula . This rule lasted from some decades in the North to five centuries in the South .
After defeating the Visigoths in only a few months , the Umayyad Caliphate started expanding rapidly in the peninsula . Beginning in 726 , the land that is now Portugal became part of the vast Umayyad Caliphate 's empire of Damascus , which stretched from the Indus river in the Indian sub-continent up to the South of France , until its collapse in 750 . That year the west of the empire gained its independence under Abd-ar-Rahman I with the establishment of the Emirate of Crdoba . After almost two centuries , the Emirate became the Caliphate of Crdoba in 929 , until its dissolution a century later in 1031 into no less than 23 small kingdoms , called Taifa kingdoms .
The governors of the taifas each proclaimed themselves Emir of their provinces and established diplomatic relations with the Christian kingdoms of the north . Most of present-day Portugal fell into the hands of the Taifa of Badajoz of the Aftasid Dynasty , and after a short spell of an ephemeral Taifa of Lisbon in 1022 , fell under the dominion of the Taifa of Seville of the Abbadids poets . The Taifa period ended with the conquest of the Almoravids who came from Morocco in 1086 winning a decisive victory at the Battle of Sagrajas , followed a century later in 1147 , after the second period of Taifa , by the Almohads , also from Marrakesh .
Al-Andaluz was divided into different districts called Kura . Gharb Al-Andalus at its largest was constituted of ten kuras , each with a distinct capital and governor . The main cities of the period in Portugal were in the southern half of the country : Beja ( Portugal ) , Silves Municipality , Portugal , Alccer do Sal , Santarm , Portugal and Lisbon .
The Muslim population of the region consisted mainly of native Iberian converts to Islam ( the so-called Muwallad or Muladi ) and berbers . The Arabs were principally noblemen from Syria and Oman ; and though few in numbers , they constituted the elite of the population . The Berbers were originally from the Rif and Atlas mountains region of North Africa and were nomads .
=== County of Portugal ===
An Asturian Visigothic noble named Pelagius of Asturias in 718 was elected leader by many of the ousted Visigoth nobles . Pelagius called for the remnant of the Christian Visigothic armies to rebel against the Moors and regroup in the unconquered northern Asturian highlands , better known today as the Cantabrian Mountains , in what is today the small mountain region in North-western Spain , adjacent to the Bay of Biscay .
Pelagius ' plan was to use the Cantabrian mountains as a place of refuge and protection from the invading Moors . He then aimed to regroup the Iberian Peninsula 's Christian armies and use the Cantabrian mountains as a springboard from which to regain their lands . In the process , after defeating the Moors in the Battle of Covadonga in 722 , Pelagius was proclaimed king , thus founding the Christian Kingdom of Asturias and starting the war of Christian reconquest known in Portuguese language as the Reconquista .
At the end of the 9th century , the region of Portugal , between the rivers Minho and Douro , was reconquered from the Moors by the nobleman and knight Vmara Peres on the orders of King Alfonso III of Asturias . Finding that the region had previously had two major cities  Portus Cale in the coast and Braga in the interior , with many towns that were now deserted  he decided to repopulate and rebuild them with Portuguese and Galician refugees and other Christians .
Apart from the Arabs from the South , the coastal regions in the North were also attacked by Normans and Viking raiders mainly from 844 . The last great invasion , through the Minho ( river ) , ended with the defeat of Olaf II Haraldsson in 1014 against the Galician nobility who also stopped further advances into the County of Portugal .
Count Vmara Peres organized the region he had reconquered , and elevated it to the status of County , naming it the County of Portugal after the region 's major port city  Portus Cale or modern Porto . One of the first cities Vimara Peres founded at this time is Vimaranes , known today as Guimares  the `` birthplace of the Portuguese nation '' or the `` cradle city '' ( Cidade Bero in Portuguese ) .
After annexing the County of Portugal into one of the several counties that made up the Kingdom of Asturias , King Alfonso III of Asturias knighted Vmara Peres , in 868 , as the First Count of Portus Cale ( Portugal ) . The region became known as Portucale , Portugale , and simultaneously Portuglia  the County of Portugal .
Later the Kingdom of Asturias was divided into a number of Christian Kingdoms in Northern Iberia due to dynastic divisions of inheritance among the king 's offspring . With the forced abdication of Alfonso III of Asturias Alfonso III `` the Great '' of Asturias by his sons in 910 , the Kingdom of Asturias split into three separate kingdoms . The three kingdoms were eventually reunited in 924 under the crown of Kingdom of Len .
In 1093 , Alfonso VI of Len bestowed the county to Henry , Count of Portugal and married him to his illegitimate daughter , Teresa of Len , Countess of Portugal , for his role in reconquering the land from Moors . Henry based his newly formed county in Bracara Augusta ( modern Braga ) , capital city of the ancient Roman province , and also previous capital of several kingdoms over the first millennia .
===Afonsine era===
On 24 June 1128 , the Battle of So Mamede occurred near Guimares . Afonso I of Portugal , Count of Portugal , defeated his mother Teresa , Countess of Portugal and her lover Ferno Peres de Trava , thereby establishing himself as sole leader . Afonso then turned his arms against the Moors in the south .
Afonso 's campaigns were successful and , on 25 July 1139 , he obtained an overwhelming victory in the Battle of Ourique , and straight after was unanimously proclaimed King of Portugal by his soldiers . This is traditionally taken as the occasion when the County of Portugal , as a fief of the Kingdom of Len , was transformed into the independent Kingdom of Portugal .
Afonso then established the first of the Portuguese Cortes at Lamego , where he was crowned by the Archbishop of Braga , though the validity of the Cortes of Lamego has been disputed and called a myth created during the Portuguese Restoration War . Afonso was recognized in 1143 by King Alfonso VII of Len , and in 1179 by Pope Alexander III .
During the Reconquista period , Christians reconquered the Iberian Peninsula from Moors domination . Afonso Henriques and his successors , aided by military Christian monasticism , pushed southward to drive out the Moors . At this time , Portugal covered about half of its present area . In 1249 , the Reconquista ended with the capture of the Algarve and complete expulsion of the last Moorish settlements on the southern coast , giving Portugal its present-day borders , with minor exceptions .
In one of these situations of conflict with the kingdom of Castile , Dinis I of Portugal signed with the king Fernando IV of Castile ( who was represented , when a minor , by his mother the queen Maria de Molina ) the Treaty of Alcaices ( 1297 ) , which stipulated that Portugal abolished agreed treaties against the kingdom of Castile for supporting the infant Juan de Castilla . This treaty established among other things the border demarcation between the kingdom of Portugal and the kingdom of Leon , where the disputed town of Olivenza was included .
The reigns of Denis I of Portugal ( Denis I ) , Afonso IV of Portugal ( Alphons IV ) , and Peter I of Portugal ( Peter I ) for the most part saw peace with the Christian kingdoms of Iberia .
In 1348 and 1349 Portugal , like the rest of Europe , was devastated by the Black Death . In 1373 , Portugal made an Anglo-Portuguese Alliance , which is the longest-standing alliance in the world . Over time , this went far beyond geo-political and military cooperation ( protecting both nations ' interests in Africa , the Americas and Asia against French , Spanish and Dutch rivals ) and maintained strong trade and cultural ties between the two old European allies . In the Oporto region , in particular , there is visible English influence to this day .
=== Joanine era and Age of Discoveries ===
In 1383 , John I of Castile , husband of Beatrice of Portugal and son-in-law of Ferdinand I of Portugal , claimed the throne of Portugal . A faction of petty noblemen and commoners , led by John I of Portugal ( later King John I of Portugal ) and commanded by General Nuno lvares Pereira defeated the Castilians in the Battle of Aljubarrota . With this battle , the House of Aviz became the ruling house of Portugal .
Portugal spearheaded European exploration of the world and the Age of Discovery . Prince Henry the Navigator , son of King John I of Portugal , became the main sponsor and patron of this endeavour . During this period , Portugal explored the Atlantic Ocean , discovering the Atlantic archipelagos the Azores , Madeira , and Portuguese Cape Verde ; explored the African coast ; colonized selected areas of Africa ; discovered an eastern Portuguese India Armadas via the Cape of Good Hope ; Colonial Brazil # Discovery and early exploitation , explored the Indian Ocean , established trading routes throughout most of southern Asia ; and sent the first direct European maritime trade and diplomatic missions to Jorge lvares and Nanban trade .
In 1415 , Portugal acquired the first of its overseas colonies by conquering Ceuta , the first prosperous Islamic trade centre in North Africa . There followed the first discoveries in the Atlantic : Madeira and the Azores , which led to the first colonialism movements .
Throughout the 15th century , European exploration of Africa # Portuguese sailed the coast of Africa , establishing trading posts for Economic history of Portugal # Expansion of the Portuguese empire ( 15th and 16th centuries ) , ranging from gold to slavery , as they looked for a route to India and its spices , which were coveted in Europe .
The Treaty of Tordesillas , intended to resolve the dispute that had been created following the return of Christopher Columbus , was made by Pope Alexander VI , the mediator between Portugal and Spain . It was signed on 7 June 1494 , and divided the newly discovered lands outside Europe between the two countries along a meridian 370 leagues west of the Cape Verde islands ( off the west coast of Africa ) .
In 1498 , Vasco da Gama accomplished what Christopher Columbus set out for and became the first European to reach India by sea , bringing Economic history of Portugal and its population of 1.7 ; million residents , and helping to start the Portuguese Renaissance . In 1500 , the Portuguese explorer Gaspar Corte-Real reached what is now Canada and founded the town of Portugal Cove-St. Philip 's , Newfoundland and Labrador , long before the French and English in the 17th century , and being just one of many Portuguese colonization of the Americas .
In 1500 , Pedro lvares Cabral discovered Brazil and claimed it for Portugal . Ten years later , Afonso de Albuquerque conquered Goa in India , Muscat , Oman and Ormuz in the Persian Strait , and Malacca , now a States of Malaysia in Malaysia . Thus , the Portuguese empire held dominion over commerce in the Indian Ocean and South Atlantic . Portuguese sailors set out to reach Eastern Asia by sailing eastward from Europe , landing in such places as Taiwan , Japan , the island of Timor , and in the Moluccas .
Although for a long period it was believed the Dutch people were the first Europeans to arrive in Australia , there is also some evidence that the Theory of the Portuguese discovery of Australia in 1521 . From 1519 to 1522 , Ferdinand Magellan ( Ferno de Magalhes ) organized a Spanish expedition to the East Indies which resulted in the first circumnavigation of the globe . Magellan never made it back to Europe as he was murdered by natives in the Philippines in 1521.
The Treaty of Zaragoza , signed on 22 April 1529 between Portugal and Spain , specified the anti-meridian to the line of demarcation specified in the Treaty of Tordesillas .
All these factors made Portugal one of the world 's major economic , military , and political powers from the 15th century until the late 16th century .
=== Iberian Union , Restoration and early Brigantine era ===
Portugal voluntarily entered a dynastic union between 1580 and 1640 . This occurred because the last two kings of the House of Aviz ;  King Sebastian of Portugal , who died in the battle of Alccer Quibir in Morocco , and his great-uncle and successor , King-Cardinal ( Catholic Church ) Henry I of Portugal ;  both died without heirs , resulting in the Portuguese succession crisis of 1580.
Subsequently , Philip II of Spain claimed the throne and was accepted as Philip I of Portugal . Portugal did not lose its formal independence , briefly forming a Iberian Union of kingdoms . At this time Spain was a geographic region . The joining of the two crowns deprived Portugal of an independent foreign policy and led to its involvement in the Eighty Years ' War between Spain and the Netherlands .
War led to a deterioration of the relations with Anglo-Portuguese Alliance Portugal 's oldest ally , England , and the loss of Ormus , a strategic trading post located between Iran and Oman . From 1595 to 1663 the Dutch-Portuguese War primarily involved the Dutch companies invading many Portuguese colonies and commercial interests in Brazil , Africa , India and the Far East , resulting in the loss of the Portuguese Indian sea trade monopoly .
In 1640 , John IV of Portugal spearheaded an uprising backed by disgruntled nobles and was proclaimed king . The Portuguese Restoration War ended the sixty-year period of the Iberian Union under the House of Habsburg . This was the beginning of the House of Braganza , which reigned in Portugal until 1910.
King John IV 's eldest son came to reign as Afonso VI of Portugal , however his physical and mental disabilities left him overpowered by Lus de Vasconcelos e Sousa , 3rd Count of Castelo Melhor . In a palace coup organized by the King 's wife , Maria Francisca of Savoy , and his brother , Peter II of Portugal Pedro , Duke of Beja , King Afonso VI was declared mentally incompetent and exiled first to the Azores and then to the Sintra National Palace , outside Lisbon . After Afonso 's death , Pedro came to the throne as King Pedro II . Pedro 's reign saw the consolidation of national independence , imperial expansion , and investment in domestic production .
Pedro II 's son , John V of Portugal , saw a reign characterized by the influx of gold into the coffers of the royal treasury , supplied largely by the royal fifth ( a tax on precious metals ) that was received from the Portuguese empire of State of Brazil and State of Maranho ( colonial ) .
Disregarding traditional Portuguese institutions of governance , John V acted as an absolute monarch , nearly depleting the country 's tax revenues on ambitious architectural works , most notably Mafra National Palace , and on commissions and additions for his sizeable art and literary collections .
Owing to his craving for international diplomatic recognition , John also spent large sums on the embassies he sent to the courts of Europe , the most famous being those he sent to Paris in 1715 and Rome in 1716.
Official estimates ;  and most estimates made so far ;  place the number of Portuguese migrants to Colonial Brazil during the gold rush of the 18th century at 600,000 . This represented one of the largest movements of European populations to their colonies in the Americas during colonial times .
=== Pombaline era and Enlightenment ===
In 1738 , fidalgo Sebastio Jos de Carvalho e Melo , 1st Marquis of Pombal ( later ennobled as the 1st Marquis of Pombal ( title ) ) began a diplomatic career as the Portuguese Ambassador in London and later in Vienna . The Queen consort of Portugal , Maria Anna of Austria , was fond of Carvalho e Melo ; and after his first wife died , she arranged the widowed Carvalho e Melo 's second marriage to the daughter of the Austrian Field Marshal Leopold Josef , Count von Daun . King John V of Portugal , however , was not pleased and recalled Carvalho e Melo to Portugal in 1749 . John V died the following year and his son , Joseph I of Portugal , was crowned . In contrast to his father , Joseph I was fond of Carvalho e Melo , and with the Queen Mother 's approval , he appointed Carvalho e Melo as political minister of Foreign Affairs .
As the King 's confidence in Carvalho e Melo increased , the King entrusted him with more control of the state . By 1755 , Sebastio Jos de Carvalho e Melo was made Prime Minister . Impressed by British economic success that he had witnessed from his time as an Ambassador , he successfully implemented similar Economic system policies in Portugal . He Slavery in Portugal # Banning in mainland Portugal and in the Portuguese colonies in India , reorganized the army and the navy , restructured the University of Coimbra , and ended legal discrimination against different Christianity sects in Portugal by abolishing the distinction between Old Christian and New Christians .
Carvalho e Melo 's greatest reforms were economic and financial , with the creation of several companies and guilds to regulate every commercial activity . He created one of the first appellation in the world by demarcating the region for production of port wine to ensure the wine 's quality ; and this was the first attempt to control wine quality and production in Europe . He ruled with a strong hand by imposing strict law upon all classes of Portuguese society from the high nobility to the poorest working class , along with a widespread review of the country 's tax system . These reforms gained him enemies in the upper classes , especially among the high nobility , who despised him as a social upstart .
Disaster fell upon Portugal in the morning of 1 November 1755 , when Lisbon was struck by 1755 Lisbon earthquake with an estimated Moment magnitude scale of 8.59 . The city was razed to the ground by the earthquake and the subsequent tsunami and ensuing fires . Carvalho e Melo survived by a stroke of luck and then immediately embarked on rebuilding the city , with his famous quote : `` What now ? We bury the dead and take care of the living . ''
Despite the calamity and huge death toll , Lisbon suffered no epidemics and within less than one year was already being rebuilt . The new city centre of Lisbon was designed to resist subsequent earthquakes . Architectural models were built for tests , and the effects of an earthquake were simulated by having troops march around the models . The buildings and large squares of the Lisbon Baixa still remain as one of Lisbon 's tourist attractions . Carvalho e Melo also made an important contribution to the study of seismology by designing a detailed inquiry on the effects of the earthquake , the Parochial Memories of 1758 , that was sent to every parish in the country ; this wealth of information allows modern scientists to reconstruct the event with some degree of scientific precision .
Following the earthquake , Joseph I of Portugal gave his Prime Minister even more power , and Carvalho de Melo became a powerful , Enlightened absolutism . As his power grew , his enemies increased in number , and bitter disputes with the upper nobility became frequent . In 1758 Joseph I was wounded in an attempted assassination . The Marquis of Tvora and the Dukes of Aveiro were implicated and Tvora affair . The following year , the Society of Jesus were Suppression of the Society of Jesus and their assets confiscated by the crown . Carvalho e Melo spared none involved , even women and children ( notably , 8-year-old Leonor de Almeida Portugal , Marquise of Alorna , imprisoned in a convent for nineteen years ) . This was the final stroke that crushed all opposition by publicly demonstrating even the aristocracy was powerless before the King 's loyal minister . Joseph I ennobled Carvalho e Melo as Count of Oeiras , Portugal in 1759.
In 1762 , SpanishPortuguese War , 17611763 as part of the Seven Years ' War , but by 1763 the status quo between Spain and Portugal before the war had been restored .
Following the Tvora affair , the new Count of Oeiras knew no opposition . Further titled `` Marqus de Pombal '' in 1770 , he effectively ruled Portugal until Joseph I 's death in 1777.
The new ruler , Queen Maria I of Portugal , disliked the Marqus de Pombal because of the power he amassed , and never forgave him for the ruthlessness with which he dispatched the Tvora family , and upon her accession to the throne , she withdrew all his political offices . The Marqus de Pombal was banished to his estate at Pombal , Portugal , where he died in 1782.
However , historians also argue that Pombal 's `` enlightenment , '' while far-reaching , was primarily a mechanism for enhancing autocracy at the expense of individual liberty and especially an apparatus for crushing opposition , suppressing criticism , and furthering colonial economic exploitation as well as intensifying book censorship and consolidating personal control and profit .
=== Napoleonic era ===
With the occupation by Napoleon , Portugal began a slow but inexorable decline that lasted until the 20th century . This decline was hastened by the independence of Brazil , the country 's largest colonial possession .
In the autumn of 1807 , Napoleon moved French troops through Spain to invade Portugal . From 1807 to 1811 , British-Portuguese forces would successfully fight against the French invasion of Portugal in the Peninsular War , during which the royal family and the Portuguese nobility , including Maria I , relocated to the Colonial Brazil , at that time a colony of the Portuguese Empire , in South America . This episode is known as the Transfer of the Portuguese Court to Brazil .
In 1807 , as Napoleon 's army closed in on Lisbon , Joo VI of Portugal , the Prince Regent , transferred his court to Brazil and established Rio de Janeiro as the capital of the Portuguese Empire . In 1815 , Brazil was declared a Kingdom and the Kingdom of Portugal was united with it , forming a pluricontinental state , the United Kingdom of Portugal , Brazil and the Algarves .
As a result of the change in its status and the arrival of the Portuguese royal family , Brazilian administrative , civic , Economic history of Brazil # The economy at independence , 1822 , military , Education in Brazil # History , and Brazilian science and technology # History apparatus were expanded and highly modernized . Portuguese and their allied British troops fought against the French Invasion of Portugal and by 1815 the situation in Europe had cooled down sufficiently that Joo VI would have been able to return safely to Lisbon . However , the King of Portugal remained in Brazil until the Liberal Revolution of 1820 , which started in Porto , demanded his return to Lisbon in 1821.
Thus he returned to Portugal but left his son Pedro I of Brazil in charge of Brazil . When the Portuguese Government attempted the following year to return the Kingdom of Brazil to subordinate status , his son Pedro , with the overwhelming support of the Brazilian elites , declared War of Independence of Brazil Brazil 's independence from Portugal . Cisplatina ( today 's sovereign state of Uruguay ) , in the south , was one of the last additions to the territory of Brazil under Portuguese rule .
Brazilian independence was recognized in 1825 , whereby Emperor Pedro I granted to his father the titular honour of Emperor of Brazil . John VI 's death in 1826 caused serious questions in his succession . Though Pedro was his heir , and reigned briefly as Pedro IV , his status as a Brazilian monarch was seen as an impediment to holding the Portuguese throne by both nations . Pedro abdicated in favour of his daughter , Maria II of Portugal ( Mary II ) . However , Pedro 's brother , Miguel I of Portugal , claimed the throne in protest . After a proposal for Miguel and Maria to marry failed , Miguel seized power as King Miguel I , in 1828 . In order to defend his daughter 's rights to the throne , Pedro launched the Portuguese Civil War to reinstall his daughter and establish a constitutional monarchy in Portugal . The war ended in 1834 , with Miguel 's defeat , the promulgation of a constitution , and the reinstatement of Queen Maria II .
=== Constitutional monarchy ===
Queen Maria II ( Mary II ) and King Ferdinand II of Portugal 's son , King Pedro V ( Peter V ) modernized the country during his short reign ( 18531861 ) . Under his reign , roads , telegraphs , and railways were constructed and improvements in public health advanced . His popularity increased when , during the cholera outbreak of 18531856 , he visited hospitals handing out gifts and comforting the sick . Pedro 's reign was short , as he died of cholera in 1861 , after a series of deaths in the royal family , including his two brothers Infante Fernando of Portugal and Infante Joo , Duke of Beja , and his wife , Stephanie of Hohenzollern-Sigmaringen . Pedro not having children , his brother , Lus I of Portugal ( Louis I ) ascended the throne and continued his modernization .
At the height of European colonialism in the 19th century , Portugal had already lost its territory in South America and all but a few bases in Asia . Luanda , Benguela , Bissau , Maputo , Porto Amboim and the Island of Mozambique were among the oldest Portuguese-founded port cities in its African territories . During this phase , Portuguese colonialism focused on expanding its outposts in Africa into nation-sized territories to compete with other European powers there .
With the Berlin Conference ( 1884 ) of 1884 , Portuguese territories in Africa had their borders formally established on request of Portugal in order to protect the centuries-long Portuguese interests in the continent from rivalries enticed by the Scramble for Africa . Portuguese towns and cities in Africa like Nova Lisboa , Lubango , Kuito , Malanje , Tete , Vila Junqueiro , Vila Pery and Vila Cabral were founded or redeveloped inland during this period and beyond . New coastal towns like Beira , Mozambique , Namibe , Lobito , Joo Belo , Nacala and Porto Amlia were also founded . Even before the turn of the 20th century , railway tracks as the Benguela railway in Angola , and the Beira railway in Mozambique , started to be built to link coastal areas and selected inland regions .
Other episodes during this period of the Portuguese presence in Africa include the 1890 British Ultimatum . This forced the Portuguese military to retreat from the land between the Portuguese colonies of Portuguese Mozambique and Portuguese Angola ( most of present-day Zimbabwe and Zambia ) , which had been claimed by Portugal and included in its `` Pink Map '' , which clashed with British aspirations to create a Cape to Cairo Railway .
The Portuguese territories in Africa were Portuguese Cape Verde , Portuguese So Tom and Prncipe , Portuguese Guinea , Angola ( Portugal ) , and Mozambique ( Portugal ) . The tiny fortress of So Joo Baptista de Ajud on the coast of Dahomey , was also under Portuguese rule . In addition , Portugal still ruled the Asian territories of Portuguese India , Portuguese Timor and Portuguese Macau .
On February 1 , 1908 , King Dom Carlos I of Portugal and his [ apparent ] and his eldest son , Luis Filipe , Prince Royal of Portugal , Duke of Braganza , Lisbon Regicide in the Terreiro do Pao by two Portuguese republican activist revolutionaries , Alfredo Lus da Costa and Manuel Bua . Under his rule , Portugal had been declared bankrupt ; twice  first on June 14 , 1892 , and then again on May 10 , 1902 ;  causing social turmoil , economic disturbances , angry protests , revolts and criticism of the monarchy . His second and youngest son , Manuel II of Portugal , became the new king , but was eventually overthrown by the 5 October 1910 revolution , which abolished the monarchy and installed a republican government in Portugal , causing him and his royal family to flee into exile in London , England .
=== First Republic and Estado Novo ===
The new republic had many problems . Portugal had 45 different governments in just 15 years . During World War I ( 19141918 ) , Portugal helped the Allies of World War I fight the Central Powers . But the war hurt its weak economy . Political instability and economic weaknesses were fertile ground for chaos and unrest during the First Portuguese Republic . These conditions would lead to the failed Monarchy of the North , 28 May 1926 coup d'tat , and the creation of the National Dictatorship ( Ditadura Nacional ) .
This in turn led to the establishment of the right-wing dictatorship of the Estado Novo ( Portugal ) under Antnio de Oliveira Salazar in 1933.
Portugal remained neutral in World War II .
From the 1940s to the 1960s , Portugal was a founding member of NATO , OECD and the European Free Trade Association ( EFTA ) . Gradually , new economic development projects and relocation of mainland Portuguese citizens into the overseas provinces in Africa were initiated , with Portuguese Angola and Portuguese Mozambique , as the largest and richest overseas territories , being the main targets of those initiatives . These actions were used to affirm Portugal 's status as a List of transcontinental countries nation and not as a colonial empire .
After India attained independence in 1947 , pro-Indian residents of Dadra and Nagar Haveli , with the support of the Indian government and the help of pro-independence organizations , separated the territories of Dadra and Nagar Haveli from Portuguese rule in 1954 . In 1961 , Fort of So Joo Baptista de Ajud 's annexation by the Republic of Dahomey was the start of a process that led to the final dissolution of the centuries-old Portuguese Empire .
According to the census of 1921 So Joo Baptista de Ajud had 5 inhabitants and , at the moment of the ultimatum by the Dahomey Government , it had only 2 inhabitants representing Portuguese Sovereignty .
Another forcible retreat from overseas territories occurred in December 1961 when Portugal refused to relinquish the territories of Goa , Daman and Diu in India . As a result , the Portuguese army and navy were involved in armed conflict in its colony of Portuguese India against the Indian Armed Forces .
The Annexation of Goa and surrender of the limited Portuguese defensive garrison , which was forced to surrender to a much larger military force . The outcome was the loss of the remaining Portuguese territories in the Indian subcontinent . The Portuguese regime refused to recognize Indian sovereignty over the annexed territories , which continued to be represented in Portugal 's National Assembly until the military coup of 1974.
Also in the early 1960s , independence movements in the Portuguese overseas provinces of Portuguese Angola , Portuguese Mozambique and Portuguese Guinea in Africa , resulted in the Portuguese Colonial War ( 19611974 ) .
Throughout the colonial war period Portugal had to deal with increasing dissent , arms embargoes and other punitive sanctions imposed by most of the international community . However , the authoritarian and conservative Estado Novo ( Portugal ) regime , first installed and governed by Antnio de Oliveira Salazar and from 1968 onwards led by Marcelo Caetano , tried to preserve a vast centuries-long intercontinental empire with a total area of 2,168,071 ; km2 .
=== Carnation Revolution and European integration ===
The Portuguese government and army resisted the decolonization of its overseas territories until April 1974 , when a bloodless left-wing military coup in Lisbon , known as the Carnation Revolution , led the way for the independence of the overseas territories in Africa and Asia , as well as for the restoration of democracy after two years of a transitional period known as PREC ( Processo Revolucionrio Em Curso ) . This period was characterized by social turmoil and power disputes between left- and right-wing political forces . By the summer of 1975 , the tension between these was so high , that the country was on the verge of civil war . The forces connected to the extreme left-wing launched a further coup d'tat on 25 November but the Group of Nine , a moderate military faction , immediately initiated a counter-coup . The main episode of this confrontation was the successful assault on the barracks of the left-wing dominated 2nd Lancers Regiment ( Portugal ) by the moderate forces of the Commando Regiment , resulting in three soldiers killed in action . The Group of Nine emerged victorious , thus preventing the establishment of a Communism state in Portugal and ending the period of political instability in the country . The retreat from the overseas territories and the acceptance of its independence terms by Portuguese head representatives for overseas negotiations , which would create independent states in 1975 , prompted a mass exodus of Portuguese citizens from Portugal 's African territories ( mostly from Portuguese Overseas Province of Angola and Overseas Province of Mozambique ) .
Over one million White African # Portuguese in Africa fled the former Portuguese provinces as white settlers were usually not considered part of the new identities of the former Portuguese colonies in Africa and Asia . Mrio Soares and Antnio de Almeida Santos were charged with organizing the independence of Portugal 's overseas territories . By 1975 , all the Portuguese African territories were independent and Portugal held 1975 Portuguese Constituent Assembly election in 50 years .
Portugal continued to be governed by a Junta de Salvao Nacional until the 1976 Portuguese legislative election . It was won by the Socialist Party ( Portugal ) ( PS ) and Mrio Soares , its leader , became Prime Minister of the 1st Constitutional Government on 23 July . Mrio Soares would be Prime Minister from 1976 to 1978 and again from 1983 to 1985 . In this capacity Soares tried to resume the economic growth and development record that had been achieved before the Carnation Revolution , during the last decade of the previous regime . He initiated the process of accession to the European Economic Community ( EEC ) by starting accession negotiations as early as 1977.
After the transition to democracy , Portugal bounced between socialism and adherence to the neoliberal model . Land reform and nationalizations were enforced ; the Portuguese Constitution ( approved in 1976 ) was rewritten in order to accommodate socialist and communist principles . Until the constitutional revisions of 1982 and 1989 , the constitution was a document with numerous references to socialism , the rights of workers , and the desirability of a socialist economy . Portugal 's economic situation after the revolution obliged the government to pursue International Monetary Fund ( IMF ) -monitored stabilization programs in 197778 and 198385 .
In 1986 , Portugal , along with Spain , joined the European Economic Community ( EEC ) that later became the European Union ( EU ) . In the following years Portugal 's economy progressed considerably as a result of EEC/EU structural and cohesion funds and Portuguese companies ' easier access to foreign markets .
Portugal 's last overseas and Asian colonial territory , Macau , was peacefully handed over to the China People 's Republic of China ( PRC ) on December 20 , 1999 , under the 1987 joint declaration that set the terms for Macau 's handover from Portugal to the PRC . In 2002 , the independence of East Timor ( Asia ) was formally recognized by Portugal , after an incomplete decolonization process that was started in 1975 because of the Carnation Revolution , but interrupted by an Indonesian armed invasion and Indonesian occupation of East Timor .
On 26 March 1995 , Portugal started to implement Schengen Area rules , eliminating border controls with other Schengen members while simultaneously strengthening border controls with non-member states . In 1996 the country was a co-founder of the Community of Portuguese Language Countries ( CPLP ) headquartered in Lisbon . In 1996 , Jorge Sampaio became president . He won 2001 Portuguese presidential election re-election in January 2001 . Expo '98 took place in Portugal and in 1999 it was one of the founding countries of the euro and the eurozone . On July 5 , 2004 , Jos Manuel Barroso , then Prime Minister of Portugal , was nominated President of the European Commission , the most powerful office in the European Union . On 1 December 2009 , the Treaty of Lisbon entered into force , after it had been signed by the European Union member states on 13 December 2007 in the Jernimos Monastery , in Lisbon , enhancing the efficiency and democratic legitimacy of the Union and improving the coherence of its action . The Republic of Ireland was the only EU state to hold a democratic referendum on the Lisbon Treaty . It was initially rejected by voters in 2008.
Economic disruption and an unsustainable growth in government debt during the financial crisis of 20072008 led the country to negotiate in 2011 with the IMF and the European Union , through the European Financial Stability Mechanism ( EFSM ) and the European Financial Stability Facility ( EFSF ) , a loan to help the country stabilize its finances .
== Geography ==
The territory of Portugal includes an area on the Iberian Peninsula ( referred to as the continent by most Portuguese ) and two archipelagos in the Atlantic Ocean : the archipelagos of Madeira and the Azores . It lies between latitudes 30th parallel north 30 and 42nd parallel north 42 N , and longitudes 32nd meridian west 32 and 6th meridian west 6 W.
Continental Portugal is split by its main river , the Tagus , that flows from Spain and disgorges in the Tagus Estuary Natural Reserve , in Lisbon , before escaping into the Atlantic . The northern landscape is mountainous towards the interior with several plateaus indented by river valleys , whereas the south , including the Algarve and the Alentejo regions , is characterized by rolling plains .
Portugal 's highest peak is the similarly named Mount Pico on the island of Pico Island in the Azores . This ancient volcano , which measures is an iconic symbol of the Azores , while the Serra da Estrela on the mainland ( the summit being above sea level ) is an important seasonal attraction for skiers and winter sports enthusiasts .
The archipelagos of Madeira and the Azores are scattered within the Atlantic Ocean : the Azores straddling the Mid-Atlantic Ridge on a tectonic triple junction , and Madeira along a range formed by plate tectonics in-plate [ ( geology ) hotspot ] geology . Geologically , these islands were formed by volcanic and seismic events . The last terrestrial volcanic eruption occurred in 195758 ( Capelinhos ) and minor earthquakes occur sporadically , usually of low intensity .
Exclusive economic zone of Portugal Portugal 's exclusive economic zone , a sea zone over which the Portuguese have special rights over the exploration and use of marine resources , has 1,727,408 ; km2 . This is the 3rd largest exclusive economic zone of the European Union and the 20th largest in the world .
=== Climate ===
Portugal is mainly characterized by a Mediterranean climate ( Csa in the South , central interior , and the Douro river valley ; Csb in the North , Central west and Southwest Alentejo and Vicentine Coast Natural Park Vicentine Coast ) , but has other climatic characteristics such as a Oceanic climate ( Cfb ) in the mountains located in Northwestern sector ( mainland ) and also in some high altitude zones of the Azorean islands , a semi-arid climate in certain parts of the Beja District far south ( BSk ) and in Porto Santo Island ( BSh ) , a BWh ( BWh ) in the Savage Islands and a Humid subtropical climate in the western Azores ( Cfa ) , according to the Kppen climate classification Kppen-Geiger Climate Classification . It is one of the warmest countries in Europe : the annual average temperature in mainland Portugal varies from in the mountainous interior north to in the south and on the Guadiana river basin . There are however , variations from the highlands to the lowlands : Spanish biologist Salvador Rivas Martinez presents several different bioclimatic zones for Portugal . The Algarve , separated from the Alentejo region by mountains reaching up to in Fia ( mountain ) , has a climate similar to that of the southern coastal areas of Spain or Southwest Australia .
Annual average rainfall in the mainland varies from just over on the Peneda-Gers National Park to less than in southern parts of Alentejo . Mount Pico is recognized as receiving the largest annual rainfall ( over per year ) in Portugal , according to Instituto Portugus do Mar e da Atmosfera .
In some areas , such as the Guadiana basin , annual diurnal average temperatures can be as high as , and summer 's highest temperatures are routinely over . The record high of was recorded in Amareleja , although this might not be the hottest spot in summer , according to satellite readings .
Snowfalls occur regularly in the winter in the interior North and Centre of the country in districts such as Guarda District , Bragana District , Viseu District and Vila Real District , particularly on the mountains . In winter , temperatures may drop below , particularly in Serra da Estrela , Serra do Gers , Serra do Maro and Montesinho Natural Park . In these places snow can fall any time from October to May . In the South of the country snowfalls are rare but still occur in the highest elevations . While the official absolute minimum by Instituto Portugus do Mar e da Atmosfera is in Penhas da Sade and Miranda do Douro , lower temperatures have been recorded , such as by Bragana , Portugal Polytechnic Institute in the outskirts of the city in 1983 , and below in Serra da Estrela .
Continental Portugal has around 2300 to 3200 hours of sunshine a year , an average of 46 ; h in winter and 1012 ; h in the summer , with higher values in the south-east , south-west and the Algarve coast and lower in the north-west . Insolation values are lower in the archipelagos , with around 1600 h in the humid Flores Island ( Azores ) and around 2300 h in the island of Madeira and Porto Santo . Insolation in the Salvages is thought to be higher due to weaker orographic lift and their relative proximity to the Sahara Desert .
Portugal 's central west and southwest coasts have an extreme ocean seasonal lag , sea temperatures are warmer in October than in July and are their coldest in March .
The average sea surface temperature on the west coast of mainland Portugal varies from in JanuaryMarch to in AugustOctober while on the south coast it ranges from in JanuaryMarch and rises in the summer to about , occasionally reaching . In the Azores , around in FebruaryApril to in JulySeptember , and in Madeira , around in FebruaryApril to in AugustOctober .
Both the archipelagos of the Azores and Madeira have a subtropical climate , although variations between islands exist , making weather predictions very difficult ( owing to rough topography ) . The Madeira and Azorean archipelagos have a narrower temperature range , with annual average temperatures exceeding in some parts of the coast ( according to the Portuguese Meteorological Institute ) . Some islands in Azores do have drier months in the summer . Consequently , the islands of the Azores have been identified as having a Mediterranean Climate ( both Csa and Csb types ) , while some islands ( such as Flores Island ( Azores ) or Corvo Island ) are classified as Humid subtropical ( Cfa ) , transitioning into an Oceanic climate ( Cfb ) at higher altitudes , according to Kppen-Geiger classification .
Porto Santo Island in Madeira has a warm semi-arid climate ( BSh ) . The Savage Islands , which are part of the regional territory of Madeira and a nature reserve are unique in being classified as a desert climate ( BWh ) with an annual average rainfall of approximately . The sea surface temperature in these islands varies from in winter to in the summer occasionally reaching .
=== Biodiversity ===
Portugal is home to six terrestrial ecoregions : Azores temperate mixed forests , Cantabrian mixed forests , Madeira evergreen forests , Iberian sclerophyllous and semi-deciduous forests , Northwest Iberian montane forests , and Southwest Iberian Mediterranean sclerophyllous and mixed forests . It had a 2019 Forest Landscape Integrity Index mean score of 0.82/10 , ranking it 168th globally out of 172 countries .
In Gers both mature deciduous and coniferous forests can be found , an extremely rare worldwide mature Mediterranean forest remain in some parts of the Arrbida mountain and a subtropical laurissilva forest , dating back to the Tertiary period , covers its largest continuous area in the world in the Madeira main island . Due to the human population decrease and rural exodus , Pyrenean oak and other local native trees are colonizing many abandoned areas .
Boar , Iberian red deer , roe deer , and the Iberian wild goat , are reported to have expanded greatly during recent decades . Boars were found recently roaming at night inside large urban areas , like in Setubal . Protected areas of Portugal include one national park , 12 natural parks , nine natural reserves , five natural monuments , and seven protected landscapes , which include the Parque Nacional da Peneda-Gers , the Parque Natural da Serra da Estrela and the Paul de Arzila Paul d'Arzila .
These natural environments are shaped by diverse flora , and include widespread species of pine ( especially the Pinus pinaster and Pinus pinea species ) , the English oak ( Quercus robur ) , the Pyrenean oak ( Quercus pyrenaica ) the chestnut ( Castanea sativa ) , the cork-oak ( Quercus suber ) , the holm oak ( Quercus ilex ) or the Portuguese oak ( Quercus faginea ) . Due to their economic value , some species of the genus Eucalyptus were introduced and are now common , despite their environmental impact .
Laurisilva is a unique type of subtropical rainforest , which nowadays , in Europe , is only restricted to the Iberian Peninsula : in the Azores , and in particular on the island of Madeira , there are large forests of endemic Laurisilva ( the latter protected as a natural heritage preserve ) .
There are several species of diverse mammalian fauna , including the red fox , European badger , iberian lynx , iberian wolf , wild goat ( Capra pyrenaica ) , wild cat ( Felis silvestris ) , Granada hare , weasel , European polecat , Common chameleon , Egyptian mongoose , common genet , the occasional brown bear and many others . Portugal is an important stopover for migratory birds , in places such as Cape St. Vincent or the Serra de Monchique mountains , where thousands of birds cross from Europe to Africa during the autumn or in the spring ( return migration ) .
Most of the avian species congregate along the Iberian Peninsula since it is the closest stopover between Northern Europe and Africa . Six hundred bird species occur in Portugal ( either for nesting or during the course of migration ) , and annually there are new registries of nesting species . The archipelagos of the Azores and Madeira are transient stopover for American , European , and African birds , while continental Portugal mostly encounters European and African bird species .
There are more than 100 freshwater fish species , varying from the giant European catfish ( in the Tagus International Natural Park ) to some small and endemic species that live only in small lakes ( along the western portion of country , for example ) . Some of these rare and specific species are highly endangered because of habitat loss , pollution and drought . Up-welling along the west coast of Portugal makes the sea extremely rich in nutrients and diverse species of marine fish ; the Portuguese marine waters are one of the richest in the world . Marine fish species are more common , and include thousands of species , such as the sardine ( Sardina pilchardus ) , tuna and Atlantic mackerel . Bioluminescent species are also well represented ( including species in different colour spectrum and forms ) , like the glowing plankton that are possible to observe on some beaches .
There are many endemic insect species , most only found in certain parts of Portugal , while other species are more widespread like the stag beetle ( Lucanus cervus ) and the cicada . The Macaronesian islands ( Azores and Madeira ) have many endemic species ( like birds , reptiles , bats , insects , snails and slugs ) that evolved independently from other regions of Portugal . In Madeira , for example , it is possible to observe more than 250 species of land gastropods .
== Government and politics ==
Portugal has been a Semi-presidential system semi-presidential Representative democracy republic since the ratification of the Portuguese Constitution of 1976 , with Lisbon , the nation 's largest city , as its capital . The Constitution grants the division or separation of powers among four bodies referred as `` organs of Sovereignty '' : the President of Portugal , the Government of Portugal , the Portuguese parliament and the Judiciary of Portugal .
The President , who is elected to a five-year term , has an executive role : the current President is Marcelo Rebelo de Sousa . The Assembly of the Republic is a single chamber parliament composed of a maximum of 230 deputies elected for a four-year term . The Government is headed by the List of Prime Ministers of Portugal ( currently Antnio Costa ) and includes Ministers and Secretaries of State . The Courts are organized into several levels , among the judicial , administrative and fiscal branches . The Portuguese Supreme Court are institutions of last resort/appeal . A thirteen-member Portuguese Constitutional Court oversees the constitutionality of the laws .
Portugal operates a multi-party system of competitive legislatures/local administrative governments at the national , regional and local levels . The Assembly of the Republic , Regional Assemblies and local municipalities and parishes , are dominated by two political parties , the Socialist Party ( Portugal ) and the Social Democratic Party ( Portugal ) , in addition to the Unitary Democratic Coalition ( Portuguese Communist Party and Ecologist Party `` The Greens '' ) , the Left Bloc and the Democratic and Social Centre ;  People 's Party , which garner between 5 and 15 % of the vote regularly .
=== Presidency of the Republic ===
The Head of State of Portugal is the President of Portugal , elected to a five-year term by direct , universal suffrage . He or she has also supervision and reserve powers . Presidential powers include the appointment of the Prime Minister and the other members of the Government ( where the President takes into account the results of legislative elections ) ; dismissing the Prime Minister ; dissolving the Assembly of the Republic ( to call early elections ) ; vetoing legislation ( which may be overridden by the Assembly ) ; and declaring a state of war or siege . The President is also the ex officio Commander-in-Chief of the Armed Forces .
The President is advised on issues of importance by the Portuguese Council of State , which is composed of six senior civilian officers , any former Presidents elected under the 1976 Constitution , five-members chosen by the Assembly , and five selected by the president .
=== Government ===
The Government is headed by the presidentially appointed Prime Minister of Portugal , also including one or more Deputy Prime Ministers , Ministers , Secretaries of State and Under-Secretaries of State .
The Government is both the organ of sovereignty that conducts the general politics of the country and the superior body of the public administration .
It has essentially Executive powers , but has also limited legislative powers . The Government can legislate about its own organization , about areas covered by legislative authorizations conceded by the Assembly of the Republic and about the specific regulation of generalist laws issued by the Assembly .
The Council of Ministers ( Portugal )  under the presidency of the Prime Minister ( or the President of Portugal at the latter 's request ) and the Ministers ( may also include one or more Deputy Prime Ministers )  acts as the Cabinet ( government ) . Each government is required to define the broad outline of its policies in a programme , and present it to the Assembly for a mandatory period of debate . The failure of the Assembly to reject the government programme by an absolute majority of deputies confirms the cabinet in office .
=== Parliament ===
The Assembly of the Republic ( Portugal ) , in Lisbon , is the national parliament of Portugal . It is the main legislative body , although the Government also has limited legislative powers .
The Assembly of the Republic is a unicameral body composed of up to 230 deputies . Elected by universal suffrage according to a system of Closed list party-list proportional representation , deputies serve four-year terms of office , unless the President dissolves the Assembly and calls for new elections .
Currently the Government ( Socialist Party ( Portugal ) ) and the parties supporting it through a Confidence and supply confidence-and-supply agreement ( Left Bloc , Portuguese Communist Party , Ecologist Party `` The Greens '' ) control parliament with the most seats . The Social Democratic Party ( Portugal ) and CDS  People 's Party CDS-PP parties form the opposition to the government alongside PeopleAnimalsNature , Chega , Iniciativa Liberal and Partido Livre .
=== Law and drug policy ===
The Portuguese legal system is part of the civil law legal system , also called the continental family legal system . The main laws include the Constitution ( 1976 , as amended ) , the Portuguese Civil Code ( 1966 , as amended ) and the Penal Code of Portugal ( 1982 , as amended ) . Other relevant laws are the Commercial Code ( 1888 , as amended ) and the Civil Procedure Code ( 1961 , as amended ) .
The supreme national courts are the Supreme Court of Justice ( Portugal ) and the Constitutional Court of Portugal . The Public Ministry ( Portugal ) , headed by the Attorney General of the Republic , constitutes the independent body of public prosecutors .
Portuguese laws were applied in the former Portuguese colonies and continue to be major influences for those countries .
Portugal was the first country in the world to abolish life imprisonment ( in 1884 ) and was one of the first countries to Capital punishment in Portugal . Maximum jail sentences are limited to 25 years .
Portugal is also known for having decriminalized the usage of all common drugs in 2001 , the first country in the world to do so . Portugal decriminalized possession of effectively all drugs that are still illegal in other developed nations including cannabis , cocaine , [ and LSD ] . While possession is legal , trafficking and possession of more than `` 10 days worth of personal use '' are still punishable by jail time and fines . People caught with small amounts of any drug are given the choice to go to a rehab facility , and may refuse treatment without consequences . Despite criticism from other European nations , who stated Portugal 's drug consumption would tremendously increase , overall drug use has declined along with the number of [ [ HIV infection cases , which had dropped 50 percent by 2009 . Drug use among 16- to 18-year-olds also declined , however the use of marijuana rose only slightly among that age group .
=== LGBTI rights ===
LGBT rights in Portugal have increased substantially in the past years . On 27 August 2003 , Portugal added the anti-discrimination employment law on the basis of sexual orientation . At 24 July 2004 , sexual orientation was added to the Constitution as part of the protected from discrimination characteristics . On 31 May 2010 , Portugal became the sixth country in Europe and the eighth country in the world to legally recognize same-sex marriage in Portugal same-sex marriage at the national level . The law came into force on 5 June 2010 . LGBT adoption Same-sex adoption has been allowed since 1 March 2016 as is female same-sex couple access to medically assisted reproduction since 13 May 2016 . This bill was adopted by the Parliament and signed by President Marcelo Rebelo de Sousa . As of January 2017 the New Law of Gender Identity , simplified the legal process of gender and name change for transgender people , making it easier for minors to change their sex marker in legal documents . At August 2018 , the right to gender identity and gender expression self-determination became protected , intersex minors became protected by law from unnecessary Intersex medical interventions `` until the minor gender identity manifests '' and the right of protection from discrimination on the basis of Sex characteristics ( legal term ) also became protected by the same law .
=== Law enforcement ===
Portugal 's main police organizations are the Guarda Nacional Republicana ;  GNR ( National Republican Guard ( Portugal ) ) , a gendarmerie ; the Polcia de Segurana Pblica ;  PSP ( Public Security Police ) , a civilian police force who work in urban areas ; and the Polcia Judiciria ;  PJ ( Judicial Police ) , a highly specialized criminal investigation police that is overseen by the Public Ministry ( Portugal ) .
=== Correctional services ===
Portugal has 49 correctional facilities in total run by the Ministry of Justice . They include 17 central prisons , 4 special prisons , 27 regional prisons , and 1 'Cadeia de Apoio ' ( Support Detention Centre ) . Their current prison population is about 12,806 inmates , which comes to about 0.12 % of their entire population . Their incarceration rate has been on the rise since 2010 , with a 15 % increase over the past eight years .
=== Administrative divisions ===
Administratively , Portugal is divided into 308 municipalities of Portugal ( municpios or concelhos ) , which after a reform in 2013 Portuguese local election are subdivided into 3,092 civil parishes ( freguesia ) . Operationally , the municipality and civil parish , along with the national government , are the only legally local administrative units identified by the government of Portugal ( for example , cities , towns or villages have no standing in law , although may be used as catchment for the defining services ) . For statistical purposes the Portuguese government also identifies Nomenclature of Territorial Units for Statistics ( NUTS ) , inter-municipal communities and informally , the district system , used until European integration ( and being phased-out by the national government ) . Continental Portugal is agglomerated into 18 districts , while the archipelagos of the Azores and Madeira are governed as autonomous area ; the largest units , established since 1976 , are either mainland Portugal ( Portugal Continental ) and the autonomous regions of Portugal ( Azores and Madeira ) .
The 18 districts of mainland Portugal are : Aveiro District , Beja District , Braga District , Bragana District , Castelo Branco District , Coimbra District , vora District , Faro District , Guarda District , Leiria District , Lisbon District , Portalegre District , Porto District , Santarm District , Setbal District , Viana do Castelo District , Vila Real District and Viseu District ;  each district takes the name of the district capital .
Within the European Union NUTS system , Portugal is divided into seven regions : the Azores , Alentejo , Algarve , Centro , Portugal , Lisboa Region , Madeira and Norte , Portugal , and with the exception of the Azores and Madeira , NUTS areas are subdivided into 28 subregions .
=== Foreign relations ===
A member state of the United Nations since 1955 , Portugal is also a founding member of NATO ( 1949 ) , OECD ( 1961 ) and European Free Trade Association ( 1960 ) ; it left the last in 1986 to join the European Economic Community , which became the European Union in 1993.
In 1996 , Portugal co-founded the Community of Portuguese Language Countries ( CPLP ) , also known as the Lusophone Commonwealth , an international organization and political association of Lusophone nations across four continents , where Portuguese language is an official language . The global headquarters of the CPLP is in Penafiel Palace , in Lisbon .
Antnio Guterres , who has served as Prime Minister of Portugal from 1995 to 2002 and United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees from 2005 to 2015 , assumed the post of United Nations Secretary-General UN Secretary-General on 1 January 2017 ; making him the first Secretary-General from Western Europe since Kurt Waldheim of Austria ( 19721981 ) , the first former head of government to become Secretary-General and the first Secretary-General born after the establishment of the United Nations on 26 June 1945.
In addition , Portugal is a full member of the Latin Union ( 1983 ) and the Organization of Ibero-American States ( 1949 ) . It has a friendship alliance and multiple citizenship treaty with its former colony , Brazil . Portugal and the United Kingdom share the world 's oldest active military accord through their Anglo-Portuguese Alliance ( Treaty of Windsor ( 1386 ) ) , which was signed in 1373.
There are two international territorial disputes , both with Spain :
* Olivenza . Under Portuguese sovereignty since 1297 , the municipality of Olivenza was ceded to Spain under the Treaty of Badajoz ( 1801 ) in 1801 , after the War of the Oranges . Portugal claimed it back in 1815 under the Congress of Vienna . However , since the 19th century , it has been continuously ruled by Spain which considers the territory theirs not only de facto but also de jure .
* The Ilhas Selvagens ( Savage Islands ) . The archipelago is under Portuguese domination but is geographically closer to the Canary Islands ( 165 ; km ) than to Madeira ( 280 ; km ) . Found in 1364 by Italian navigators , the islands belonged to private owners until 1971 , when the Portuguese government bought them and established a natural reserve area covering the whole archipelago . The islands have been claimed by Spain since 1911 and the dispute has caused some periods of political tension between the two countries . The main problem is not so much their intrinsic value but the fact that they expand the Exclusive Economic Zone of Portugal considerably to the south .
=== Military ===
The armed forces have three branches : Portuguese Navy , Portuguese Army and Portuguese Air Force . They serve primarily as a self-defense force whose mission is to protect the territorial integrity of the country and provide humanitarian assistance and security at home and abroad . , the three branches numbered 39,200 active personnel including 7,500 women . List of countries by military expenditures in 2009 was 5 billion US $ , representing 2.1 per cent of GDP . Military conscription was abolished in 2004 . The minimum age for voluntary recruitment is 18 years .
The Army ( 21,000 personnel ) comprises three brigades and other small units . An Portuguese Intervention Brigade ( mainly equipped with Pandur II Armoured personnel carrier ) , a Portuguese Mechanized Brigade ( mainly equipped with Leopard 2 tanks and M113 APC ) and a Portuguese Rapid Reaction Brigade ( consisting of Paratroopers ' Regiment , Portuguese Army Commandos and rangers ) . The Navy ( 10,700 personnel , of which 1,580 are Portuguese Marines ) , the world 's oldest surviving naval force , has five frigates , seven corvettes , two submarines , and 28 patrol and auxiliary vessels . The Air Force ( 7,500 personnel ) has the Lockheed F-16 Fighting Falcon as the main combat aircraft .
In addition to the three branches of the armed forces , there is the National Republican Guard ( Portugal ) , a security force subject to military law and organization ( gendarmerie ) comprising 25,000 personnel . This force is under the authority of both the Defense and the Interior Ministry . It has provided detachments for participation in international operations in Iraq and East Timor .
The United States maintains a military presence with 770 troops in the Lajes Air Base at Terceira Island , in the Azores . The Allied Joint Force Command Lisbon ( JFC Lisbon ) ;  one of the three main subdivisions of NATO 's Allied Command Operations ;  it is based in Oeiras Municipality , Portugal , near Lisbon .
In the 20th century , Portugal engaged in two major conflicts : Portugal in the Great War and the Portuguese Colonial War ( 19611974 ) . After the end of the Portuguese Empire in 1975 , the Portuguese Armed Forces have participated in peacekeeping missions in East Timor , Bosnia , Kosovo , Afghanistan , Somalia , Iraq ( Nasiriyah ) , Lebanon , Mali and Central African Republic . Portugal also conducted several independent unilateral military operations abroad , as were the cases of the interventions of the Portuguese Armed Forces in Angola in 1992 and in Guinea-Bissau in 1998 with the main objectives of protecting and withdrawing of Portuguese and foreign citizens threatened by local civil conflicts .
=== Government finance ===
The Portuguese government is heavily indebted , and received a 78-billion-euro bailout from the European Union and the International Monetary Fund in May 2011 . The ratio of Portugal 's debt to its overall economy , was 107 per cent when it received the bailout . As part of the deal , the country agreed to cut its budget deficit from 9.8 per cent of GDP in 2010 to 5.9 per cent in 2011 , 4.5 per cent in 2012 and 3 per cent in 2013.
After the bailout was announced , the Portuguese government headed by Pedro Passos Coelho managed to implement measures with the intention of improving the state 's financial situation , including tax hikes , a freeze of civil service-related lower-wages and cuts of higher-wages by 14.3 % , on top of the government 's spending cuts . The Portuguese government also agreed to eliminate its golden share in Portugal Telecom which gave it veto power over vital decisions . In 2012 , all public servants had already seen an average wage cut of 20 % relative to their 2010 baseline , with cuts reaching 25 % for those earning more than 1,500 euro per month .
The IMF , the European Commission ( EC ) and the European Central Bank ( ECB ) said in September 2012 that Portugal 's debt would peak at 124 per cent of gross domestic product in 2014 . The IMF previously said in July 2012 that Portugal 's debt would peak at about 118.5 per cent of GDP in 2013 . In September 2013 , the Portuguese Government reviewed again the public debt of Portugal for 2013 to 127.8 per cent , after a peak of 130.9 per cent in that month .
A report released in January 2011 by the Dirio de Notcias and published in Portugal by Gradiva , had demonstrated that in the period between the Carnation Revolution in 1974 and 2010 , the democratic Government of Portugal encouraged over-expenditure and investment bubbles through unclear Publicprivate partnerships and funding of numerous ineffective and unnecessary external consultancy and advisory of committees and firms .
This allowed considerable slippage ( finance ) in state-managed public works and inflated top management and head officer bonuses and wages . Persistent and lasting recruitment policies boosted the number of redundant public servants . Risky credit ( finance ) , public debt creation , and European structural and cohesion funds were mismanaged across almost four decades .
Two Portuguese banks , Banco Portugus de Negcios ( BPN ) and Banco Privado Portugus ( BPP ) , had been accumulating losses for years due to bad investments , embezzlement and accounting fraud . The case of BPN was particularly serious because of its size , market share , and the political implications  Portugal 's then President , Cavaco Silva and some of his political allies , maintained personal and business relationships with the bank and its CEO , who was eventually charged and arrested for fraud and other crimes . On grounds of avoiding a potentially serious financial crisis in the Portuguese economy , the Portuguese government decided to give them a bailout , eventually at a future loss to taxpayers and to the Portuguese people in general .
==Economy==
Portugal is a developed country and a [ income countries high-income country ] , with a GDP per capita of 77 % of the EU28 average in 2017 ( increasing from 75 % in 2012 ) and a List of countries by Human Development Index of 0.850 ( the 40th highest ) in 2018 . By the end of 2018 , Portugal 's GDP ( PPP ) was $ 32,554 per capita , according to OECD 's report . The national currency of Portugal is the euro (  ) , which replaced the Portuguese Escudo , and the country was one of the original member states of the eurozone . Portugal 's central bank is the Banco de Portugal , an integral part of the European System of Central Banks . Most industries , businesses and financial institutions are concentrated in the Lisbon metropolitan area and Greater Metropolitan Area of Porto metropolitan areas  the Setbal District , Aveiro District , Braga District , Coimbra District , Leiria District and Faro District districts are the biggest economic centres outside these two main areas .
According to World Travel Awards , Portugal was Europe 's Leading Golf Destination in 2012 and 2013.
Since the Carnation Revolution of 1974 , which culminated in the end of one of Portugal 's most notable Economic history of Portugal ( that started in the 1960s ) , a significant change has occurred in the nation 's annual economic growth . After the turmoil of the 1974 revolution and the Processo Revolucionrio Em Curso period , Portugal tried to adapt to a changing Globalization , a process that continues in 2013 . Since the 1990s , Portugal 's consumption ( economics ) -based economic development model has been slowly changing to a system that is focused on exports , investment and the development of the [ sector . Consequently , business services have overtaken more traditional industries such as textiles , clothing , footwear and cork ( material ) cork ] ( Portugal is the world 's leading cork producer ) , wood products and beverages .
In the second decade of the 21st century , the Portuguese economy suffered its most severe recession since the 1970s , resulting in the country having to be bailed out by the European Commission , European Central Bank and International Monetary Fund ( IMF ) . The bailout , agreed to in 2011 , required [ [ Portugal and the IMF to enter into a range of austerity measures in exchange for funding support of 78,000,000,000 . In May 2014 , the country exited the bailout but reaffirmed its commitment to maintaining its reformist momentum . At the time of exiting the bailout , the economy had contracted by 0.7 % in the first quarter of 2014 ; however , unemployment , while still high , had fallen to 15.3 % .
The average salary in Portugal is 910 per month , excluding self-employed individuals and the minimum wage , which is regulated by law , is 635 per month ( paid 14 times per annum ) as of 2020.
The Global Competitiveness Report for 2019 , published by the World Economic Forum , placed Portugal on the 34th position on the economic index .
The Economist Intelligence Unit 's quality of life index placed Portugal as the country with the 19th-best quality of life in the world for 2005 , ahead of other economically and technologically advanced countries like France , Germany , the United Kingdom and South Korea , but 9 places behind its sole neighbour , Spain . This is despite the fact that Portugal remains as one of the countries with the lowest per capita GDP in Western Europe .
Major Government-owned corporation state-owned companies include : guas de Portugal ( water ) , Caixa Geral de Depsitos ( banking ) , Comboios de Portugal ( railways ) , Companhia das Lezrias ( agriculture ) and Rdio e Televiso de Portugal ( media ) . Some former state-owned entities are managed by state-run [ company ] Parpblica , which is a shareholder of several public and private companies . Among former state-owned companies recently privatized are : CTT Correios de Portugal , S.A. ( postal service ) and ANA Aeroportos de Portugal ( airports ) .
Companies listed on Euronext Lisbon stock exchange like Energias de Portugal , Galp Energia , Jernimo Martins , Mota-Engil , Novabase , Semapa , Portucel Soporcel , Portugal Telecom and Sonae , are amongst the largest corporations of Portugal by number of employees , net income or international market share . The Euronext Lisbon is the major stock exchange of Portugal and is part of the NYSE Euronext , the first global stock exchange . The PSI-20 is Portugal 's most selective and widely known stock index .
The International Monetary Fund issued an update report on the economy of Portugal in late-June 2017 with a strong near-term outlook and an increase in investments and exports over previous years . Because of a surplus in 2016 , the country was no longer bound by the Excessive Deficit Procedure which had been implemented during an earlier financial crisis . The banking system was more stable , although there were still non-performing loans and corporate debt . The IMF recommended working on solving these problems for Portugal to be able to attract more private investment . `` Sustained strong growth , together with continued public debt reduction , would reduce vulnerabilities arising from high indebtedness , particularly when monetary accommodation is reduced . ''
The OECD economic reports since 2018 show recovery , albeit slow ; and Portugal 's growth prospects continue positive for 2020.
=== Primary sector ===
Agriculture in Portugal is based on small to medium-sized family-owned dispersed units . However , the sector also includes larger scale intensive farming export-oriented agrobusinesses backed by companies ( like Grupo RAR 's Vitacress , Sovena , Lactogal , Vale da Rosa , Companhia das Lezrias and Valouro ) . The country produces a wide variety of crops and livestock products , including : tomatoes , citrus , green vegetables , rice , wheat , barley , maize , olives , oilseeds , Nut ( fruit ) , Cherry , bilberry , table grapes , edible mushrooms , dairy products , poultry and beef . According to FAO , Portugal is the top producer of Cork ( material ) and carob in the world , accounting to about 50 % and 30 % of world production respectively .
Forestry has also played an important economic role among the rural communities and industry ( namely paper industry that includes Portucel Soporcel Group , engineered wood that includes Sonae Indstria , and furniture that includes several manufacturing plants in and around Paos de Ferreira , the core of Portugal 's major industrial operations of IKEA ) . In 2001 , the gross agricultural product accounted for 4 % of the national GDP .
Traditionally a sea power , Portugal has had a strong tradition in Fishing in Portugal and is one of the countries with the highest fish consumption per capita . The main landing sites in Portugal ( including Azores and Madeira ) , according to total landings in weight by year , are the harbours of Matosinhos , Peniche , Portugal , Olho , Sesimbra , Figueira da Foz , Sines , Portugal , Portimo and Madeira . Portuguese-processed fish products are exported through several companies , under a number of different brands and registered trademarks , such as Conservas Ramirez , the world 's oldest active canned fish producer .
Portugal is a significant European minerals producer and is ranked among Europe 's leading copper producers . The nation is also a notable producer of tin , tungsten and uranium . However , the country lacks the potential to conduct [ exploration ] and aluminium , a limitation that has hindered the development of Portugal 's Mining in Portugal and metallurgy sectors . Although the country has vast iron and coal reserves  mainly in the north  after the 1974 revolution and the consequent economic globalization , low competitiveness forced a decrease in the extraction activity for these minerals . The Panasqueira and Neves-Corvo mines are among the most recognized Portuguese mines that are still in operation .
Portugal is rich in its lithium subsoil , which is especially concentrated in the districts of Guarda District , Viseu , Vila Real and Viana do Castelo , while most of the country 's lithium comes from the Gonalo aplite-pegmatite field . The largest lithium mine in Europe is operated by Grupo Mota , Felmica , in the Guarda region , which is estimated to have reserves for 30 years of production . It has 5 more deposits in its possession . Savannah Resources in May 2018 announced a 52 % increase in the estimated lithium resources at the Mina do Barroso Lithium Project in northern Portugal , saying the country could become the first European supplier of spodumene , a lithium-bearing mineral . The company said the estimated mineral resources at the mine now stood at 14 million tonnes . Lithium prices have risen in expectation of growing demand for the mineral , which is used in batteries for electric vehicles and for storing electricity from the power grid . Europe consumes more than 20 per cent of the global supply of battery-grade lithium but currently has to import all its supplies of the mineral .
W Resources stated in 2018 that it had started a new drilling campaign at its So Martinho gold project in Portugal . The so-called reverse circulation drilling program included 15 holes with around 2,000 metres of total drilling . The objective is to extend resources by integrating the data from 2016 drilling results with the expansion expected with the ongoing campaign .
=== Secondary sector ===
Industry is diversified , ranging from Automotive industry ( Volkswagen Autoeuropa and Peugeot Citron ) and bycyclesaerospace industry aerospace ] ( [ [ Embraer and OGMA ) , electronics industry and textile industry , to food industry , chemical industry , cement and wood pulp . Volkswagen Group 's AutoEuropa motor vehicle assembly plant in Palmela is among the largest foreign direct investment projects in Portugal .
Modern non-traditional technology-based industries , such as aerospace , biotechnology and information technology , have been developed in several locations across the country . Alverca , Covilh , vora , and Ponte de Sor are the main centres of the Portuguese aerospace industry , which is led by Brazil-based company Embraer and the Portuguese company OGMA . Following the turn of the 21st century , many major biotechnology and information technology industries have been founded , and are concentrated in the metropolitan areas of Lisbon metropolitan area , Porto Metropolitan Area , Braga , Coimbra and Aveiro , Portugal .
=== Tertiary sector ===
The banking and insurance sectors performed well until the financial crisis of 20072008 , and this partly reflected a rapid deepening of the market in Portugal . While sensitive to various types of market and underwriting risks , it has been estimated that overall both the life and non-life sectors will be able to withstand a number of severe shocks , even though the impact on individual insurers varies widely .
Travel and Tourism in Portugal continue to be extremely important for Portugal . It has been necessary for the country to focus upon its niche attractions , such as health , nature and rural tourism , to stay ahead of its competitors .
Portugal is among the top 20 most-visited countries in the world , receiving an average of 20,000,000 foreign tourists each year . In 2014 , Portugal was elected The Best European Country by USA Today .
In 2017 , Portugal was elected both Europe 's Leading Destination and in 2018 and 2019 , World 's Leading Destination
Tourist hotspots in Portugal are : Lisbon , Cascais , Ftima , Portugal , Algarve , Madeira , Porto and Coimbra . Lisbon attracts the sixteenth-most tourists among European cities ( with seven million tourists occupying the city 's hotels in 2006 ) . Notable luxury destinations include the Portuguese Riviera and the Comporta .
Also , between 56 million religious pilgrims visit Ftima , Portugal each year , where apparitions of the Blessed Virgin Mary to three shepherd children reportedly took place in 1917 . The Sanctuary of Ftima is one of the largest Roman Catholic shrines in the world . The Portuguese government continues to promote and develop new tourist destinations , such as the Douro , the island of Porto Santo Island , and Alentejo .
The legend of the Rooster of Barcelos tells the story of a dead rooster 's miraculous intervention in proving the innocence of a man who had been falsely accused and sentenced to death . The story is associated with the 17th-century Calvary ( sculpture ) that is part of the collection of the Archaeological Museum located in Pao dos Condes , a gothic-style palace in Barcelos , Portugal , a city in northwest Portugal .
The Rooster of Barcelos is bought by thousands of tourists as a national souvenir .

On 7 December 2017 , the United Nations added the Bonecos de Estremoz  Toys of Estremoz tradition as an UNESCO Intangible Cultural Heritage Lists of Humankind .
===Quaternary sector===
Scientific and technological research activities in Portugal are mainly conducted within a network of R & D units belonging to list of universities in Portugal and state-managed autonomous research institutions like the Instituto Nacional de Engenharia , Tecnologia e Inovao INETI ;  Instituto Nacional de Engenharia , Tecnologia e Inovao and the Instituto Nacional dos Recursos Biolgicos INRB ;  Instituto Nacional dos Recursos Biolgicos . The funding and management of this research system is mainly conducted under the authority of the Ministry of Science , Technology and Higher Education ( MCTES ) and the MCTES 's Fundao para a Cincia e Tecnologia ( FCT ) .
The largest R & D units of the public universities by volume of research grants and peer-reviewed publications , include biosciences research institutions like the Instituto de Medicina Molecular , the Centre for Neuroscience and Cell Biology , the IPATIMUP , the Instituto de Biologia Molecular e Celular and the Abel Salazar Biomedical Sciences Institute .
Among the largest non-state-run research institutions in Portugal are the Instituto Gulbenkian de Cincia and the Champalimaud Foundation , a neuroscience and oncology research centre which awards every year one of the highest monetary prizes of any science prize in the world . A number of both national and multinational high-tech and industrial companies , are also responsible for research and development projects . One of the oldest learned societies of Portugal is the Sciences Academy of Lisbon , founded in 1779.
Iberian peninsula bilateral state-supported research efforts include the International Iberian Nanotechnology Laboratory and the Ibercivis distributed computing platform , which are joint research programmes of both Portugal and Spain . Portugal is a member of several pan-European scientific organizations . These include the European Space Agency ( ESA ) , the European Laboratory for Particle Physics ( CERN ) , ITER , and the European Southern Observatory ( ESO ) .
Portugal has the largest aquarium in Europe , the Lisbon Oceanarium , and the Portuguese have several other notable organizations focused on science-related exhibits and divulgation , like the state agency Cincia Viva , a programme of the Portuguese Ministry of Science and Technology to the promotion of a scientific and technological culture among the Portuguese population , the Science Museum of the University of Coimbra , the List of natural history museums # Portugal at the University of Lisbon , and the Visionarium ( Portugal ) .
With the emergence and growth of several science parks throughout the world that helped create many thousands of scientific , technological and knowledge-based businesses , Portugal started to develop several science parks across the country . These include the Taguspark ( in Oeiras Municipality , Portugal ) , the Coimbra iParque ( in Coimbra ) , the biocant ( in Cantanhede Municipality ) , the Madeira Tecnopolo ( in Funchal ) , Sines Tecnopolo ( in Sines , Portugal ) , Tecmaia ( in Maia Municipality ) and Parkurbis ( in Covilh ) . Companies locate in the Portuguese science parks to take advantage of a variety of services ranging from financial and legal advice through to marketing and technological support .
Egas Moniz , a Portuguese physician who developed the cerebral angiography and leucotomy , received in 1949 the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine ;  he is the first Portuguese recipient of a Nobel Prize and the only in the sciences .
The European Innovation Scoreboard 2011 , placed Portugal-based innovation in the 15th position , with an impressive increase in innovation expenditure and output .
=== Transport ===
By the early-1970s , Portugal 's Economic history of Portugal with increasing mass consumption and purchase of new automobiles set the priority for improvements in transportation . Again in the 1990s , after joining the European Economic Community , the country built many new motorways . Today , the country has a road network , of which almost are part of system of 44 motorways . Opened in 1944 , the first motorway ( which linked Lisbon to the National Stadium ) was an innovative project that made Portugal one of the first countries in the world to establish a motorway ( this roadway eventually became the Lisbon-Cascais highway , or A5 ) .
Although a few other tracts were created ( around 1960 and 1970 ) , it was only after the beginning of the 1980s that large-scale motorway construction was implemented . In 1972 , BRISA Auto-estradas de Portugal S.A. , the highway concessionaire , was founded to handle the management of many of the region 's motorways . On many highways , a toll needs to be paid ( see Via Verde ) . Vasco da Gama bridge is the longest bridge in Europe at 12.345 ; km .
Continental Portugal 's territory is serviced by four international airports located near the principal cities of Lisbon , Porto , Faro , Portugal and Beja ( Portugal ) . Lisbon 's geographical position makes it a stopover for many foreign airlines at several airports within the country . The primary flag-carrier is TAP Air Portugal , although many other domestic airlines provide services within and without the country . The government decided to build a new airport outside Lisbon , in Alcochete , to replace Lisbon Portela Airport , though this plan has been suspended due to austerity measures . Currently , the most important airports are in Portela Airport , Francisco S Carneiro Airport , Faro Airport , Madeira Airport ( Madeira ) , and Joo Paulo II Airport ( Azores ) , managed by the national airport authority group ANA ;  Aeroportos de Portugal . One other important airport is the Aeroporto Internacional das Lajes on the island of Terceira in the Azores . This airport serves as one of two international airports serving countries outside the European Union for all nine islands of the Azores . It also serves as a military air base for the United States Air Force . The base remains in use to the present day .
A national railway system that extends throughout the country and into Spain , is supported and administered by Comboios de Portugal ( CP ) . Rail transport of passengers and goods is derived using the of railway lines currently in service , of which are electrified and about allow train speeds greater than . The railway network is managed by Infraestruturas de Portugal while the transport of passengers and goods are the responsibility of CP , both public companies . In 2006 , the CP carried 133,000,000 passengers and of goods .
The major seaports are located in Sines , Portugal , Lisbon , Leixes , Setbal , Aveiro , Portugal , Figueira da Foz , and Faro , Portugal .
The two largest metropolitan areas have subway systems : Lisbon Metro and Metro Sul do Tejo in the Lisbon metropolitan area and Porto Metro in the Porto Metropolitan Area , each with more than of lines . In Portugal , Trams in Lisbon have been supplied by the Companhia de Carris de Ferro de Lisboa ( Carris ) , for over a century . In Porto , Trams in Porto , of which only a tourist line on the shores of the Douro remains , began construction on 12 September 1895 ( a first for the Iberian Peninsula ) . All major cities and towns have their own local urban transport network , as well as taxi services .
=== Energy ===
Portugal has considerable resources of wind and river power , the two most cost-effective renewable energy sources . Since the turn of the 21st century , there has been a trend towards the development of a renewable resource industry and reduction of both consumption and use of fossil fuels . In 2006 , the world 's largest solar energy plant at that date , the Moura Photovoltaic Power Station , began operating near Moura , Portugal , in the south , while the world 's first commercial wave power farm , the Aguadoura Wave Farm , opened in the Norte Region , Portugal ( 2008 ) . By the end of 2006 , 66 % of the country 's electrical production was from coal and fuel power plants , while 29 % were derived from [ dams , and 6 % by wind energy ] .
In 2008 , renewable energy resources were producing 43 % of the nation 's consumption of electricity , even as hydroelectric production decreased with severe droughts . As of June 2010 , electricity exports had outnumbered imports . In the period between January and May 2010 , 70 % of the national production of energy came from renewable sources .
Portugal 's national energy transmission company , [ [ Redes Energticas Nacionais ( REN ) , uses sophisticated modelling to predict weather , especially wind patterns , and computer programs to calculate energy from the various renewable-energy plants .
Before the solar/wind revolution , Portugal had generated electricity from hydropower plants on its rivers for decades . New programmes combine wind and water : wind-driven turbines pump water uphill at night , the most blustery period ; then the water flows downhill by day , generating electricity , when consumer demand is highest . Portugal 's distribution system is also now a two-way street . Instead of just delivering electricity , it draws electricity from even the smallest generators , like rooftop solar panels . The government aggressively encouraged such contributions by setting a premium price for those who buy rooftop-generated solar electricity .
== Demographics ==
The Statistics Portugal ( INE  Instituto Nacional de Estatstica ( Portugal ) ) estimates that , according to the 2011 census , the population was 10,562,178 ( of which 52 % was female , 48 % was male ) . In 2019 and according to more up-to-date figures , the population decreased to 10,295,909 , although it was an increase compared with 2018 . This population has been relatively homogeneous for most of its history : a single religion ( Roman Catholicism ) and a single language have contributed to this ethnic and national unity .
The most important demographic influence in the modern Portuguese seems to be the oldest one ; current interpretation of Y-chromosome and mtDNA data suggests that the Portuguese have their origin in Paleolithic peoples that began arriving to the European continent around 45,000 years ago . All subsequent migrations did leave an impact , genetically and culturally , but the main population source of the Portuguese is still Paleolithic . Genetic studies show Portuguese populations not to be significantly different from other European populations . Portuguese people have a preponderancy of genetics ( Iron Age Period ) which belong to R1b haplogroup family along with Brittonic languages , Alpine states and Goidelic languages genetical markers . Also expectable but not so common are South European ( Sardinian , Italian and Balkans ) , Broadly Northwestern ( West Germanic ) and to a lesser extent British/Irish ( Brythonic/Gaelic ) and French ( Alpine ) . With a low confidence range there are Scandinavian and East European genetical markers . Other sources would point out a small presence of Berbers and Jewish that would be also part of a low confidence region .
Native Portuguese are an Iberian Peninsula ethnic group and they form 95 % of the whole population , whose ancestry is very similar to Spaniards and have strong ties with fellow Atlantic Europe like Ireland , British Isles , France and Belgium due to maritime trade dated as far back as the Bronze Age . These maritime contacts and the prevalence of R1b haplogroup as the main genetical marker of these countries suggest a common ancestry and cultural proximity . Other maritime contacts with the Mediterranean especially with Greeks , Phoenicians , Romans and Moors add some particular phenotypes in Southern Portugal and particularly Southern Spain ( Tartessos culture ) making Portugal and Northwestern Spain a bridge between North Western Europe and the Mediterranean but maintaining the Atlantic character .
Despite the good economic development in the past three decades the Portuguese were the shortest in Europe since 1890 . This emerging height gap took place in the 1840s and has increased since . One of the driving factors was the modest real wage development , given the late industrialization and economic growth in Portugal compared to the European core . Another determinant was the delayed [ capital ] formation .
The total fertility rate ( TFR ) was estimated at 1.52 children born/woman , one of the lowest in the world , which is below the replacement rate of 2.1 , it remains considerably below the high of 5.02 children born per woman in 1911 . In 2016 , 52.8 % of births were to unmarried women .
Like most Western countries , Portugal has to deal with low fertility levels : the country has experienced a sub-replacement fertility rate since the 1980s . Portugal subsequently has the 17th oldest population in the world , with the average age of 43.7 years .
The structure of Portuguese society is characterized by a significant inequality which in 2016 placed the country in the lowest seventh of the Social Justice Index for the European Union .
Portugal 's parliament in 2018 approved a budget plan for 2019 that includes tax breaks for returning emigrants in a bid to lure back those who left during the financial crisis of 20072008 . The expansionary 2019 budget , backed by a left-wing majority in parliament , also aims to boost the purchasing power of households while cutting the already low deficit even further . Circular migration will be allowed to declare only half their taxable income for five years if they return , provided they lived abroad for at least three years . The `` Return Programme '' is to run for two years . Around 500,000 residents left Portugal between 2010 and 2015 after the Great Recession . Although some 350,000 have since returned , Lisbon wants to tempt the rest to come home  in a similar scheme to the Irish one . Portugal has approved a credit line for Portuguese emigrants aiming to invest in the country on their return . Furthermore , Emigrants returning in 2019 and 2020 will see their taxes halved as part of the stimulus to bring native Portuguese back and revitalize the population and promote continued economic growth  as Portugal struggles with a low birth rate and an ageing population . According to projections by the national statistics office , Portugal 's population will fall to 7.7 million by 2080 from 10.3 million now and the population will continue to age .

=== Immigration ===
In 2007 , Portugal had 10,617,575 inhabitants of whom about 332,137 were legal Immigration to Portugal . In 2015 , Portugal had 10,341,330 inhabitants of whom about 383,759 were legal migrants , making up 3.7 % of the population .

In 2019 , 21,099 residents of foreign origin acquired the Portuguese nationality , of which 11,179 were female and 9,920 were male.PORDATA - Foreign population that acquired portuguese nationality : total and by sex
Portugal 's Portuguese Empire has long since been a cornerstone of its national identity , as has its geographic position at the south-western corner of Europe , looking out into the Atlantic Ocean . It was one of the last western colonial European powers to give up its overseas territories ( among them Portuguese West Africa and Portuguese East Africa in 1975 ) , turning over the administration of Macau to the People 's Republic of China at the end of 1999 . Consequently , it has both influenced and been influenced by cultures from former colonies or dependencies , resulting in immigration from these former territories for both economic and personal reasons . Portugal , long a country of emigration ( the vast majority of Portuguese Brazilian have Portuguese ancestry ) , has now become a country of net immigration , and not just from the last Portuguese India ( Portuguese until 1961 ) , Portuguese-speaking African countries ( Portuguese until 1975 ) , and Macau ( Portuguese until 1999 ) overseas territories . An estimated 800,000 Portuguese returned to Portugal as the country 's African possessions gained independence in 1975.
Since the 1990s , along with a boom in construction , several new waves of Ukrainians , Brazilians , Portuguese-speaking African countries and other Africans have settled in the country . Romanian people , Moldovans , Kosovo Albanians , Russian people and Chinese people have also migrated to the country . Portugal 's Romani people population is estimated to be at about 40,000.
Numbers of Venezuelan people , Pakistani people and Indian people migrants are also significant . It is estimated that over 30,000 seasonal , often illegal immigrants work in agriculture , mainly in the south where they are often exploited by organised seasonal-worker 's networks . The workers sometimes get paid less than half the minimum pay established by law . These migrants who often arrive without due documentation or work-contracts , make make over 90 % of agricultural workers in the south of Portugal .
Most are Indo-Asians , from India , Bangladesh , Nepal , Pakistan and Thailand . In the interior of the Alentejo there are many African workers . Significant numbers also come from Eastern Europe , Moldova , Ukraine , Romania and Brazil .
In addition , a number of EU citizens , mostly from the United Kingdom or other northern European countries , have become permanent residents in the country ( with the British community being mostly composed of retired pensioners who live in the Algarve and Madeira ) .
=== Religion ===
According to the 2011 Census , 81.0 % of the Portuguese population was Catholic Church . The country has small Protestant , The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints Latter-day Saint , Islam in Portugal , Hinduism in Portugal , Sikh , Eastern Orthodox Church , Jehovah 's Witnesses , Bah Faith , Buddhism , Judaism and Spiritism communities . Influences from African Traditional Religion and Chinese Traditional Religion are also felt among many people , particularly in fields related with Traditional Chinese Medicine and Traditional African Herbal Medicine . Some 6.8 % of the population declared themselves to be non-religious , and 8.3 % did not give any answer about their religion .
Many Portuguese holidays , festivals and traditions have a Christian origin or connotation . Although relations between the Portuguese state and the Roman Catholic Church were generally amiable and stable since the earliest years of the Portuguese nation , their relative power fluctuated . In the History of Portugal ( 1279-1415 ) , the church enjoyed both riches and power stemming from its role in the Reconquista , its close identification with early Portuguese nationalism and the foundation of the Portuguese educational system , including its University of Coimbra .
The growth of the Portuguese Empire made its Mission ( Christian ) important agents of colonization , with important roles in the Teaching and evangelization of people from all the inhabited continents . The growth of Liberal Revolution of 1820 and nascent Republicanism movements during the eras leading to the formation of the First Portuguese Republic ( 191026 ) changed the role and importance of organized religion .
Portugal is a secular state : Separation of church and state during the First Portuguese Republic , and this was reiterated in the 1976 Portuguese Constitution . Other than the Constitution , the two most important documents relating to religious freedom in Portugal are the 1940 Concordata ( later amended in 1971 ) between Portugal and the Holy See and the 2001 Religious Freedom Act .
=== Languages ===
Portuguese is the official language of Portugal . It is a Romance language that is derived from Galician-Portuguese , which was spoken in what is now Galicia ( Spain ) and Northern Portugal . There are still many similarities between the Galicians and Portuguese people cultures . Galicia is a consultative observer of the Community of Portuguese Language Countries .
The Portuguese language is derived from the Latin language spoken by the Romanization ( cultural ) pre-Roman peoples of the Iberian Peninsula around 2000 years ago  particularly the Celts , Conii , Lusitanians and Turduli .
In the 15th and 16th centuries , the language spread worldwide as Portugal established a colonial and commercial empire between 1415 and 1999.
Portuguese is spoken as a native language in five different continents , with Brazil accounting for the largest number of native Portuguese speakers of any country .
In 2013 the Portuguese language is the official language spoken in Brazil , Angola , Mozambique , Cape Verde , So Tom and Prncipe , Guinea-Bissau , Equatorial Guinea , and East Timor . These countries , plus Macau Special Administrative Region ( People 's Republic of China ) where Portuguese is co-official with Cantonese , make up the Lusosphere , a term derived from the ancient Roman province of `` Lusitania '' , which currently matches the Portuguese territory south of the Douro river .

=== Education ===
The educational system is divided into preschool ( for those under age 6 ) , basic education ( 9 years , in three stages , compulsory ) , secondary education ( 3 years , compulsory since 2010 ) , and higher education ( subdivided in university and polytechnic ( Portugal ) education ) . Universities are usually organized into faculty ( division ) . Institutes and schools are also common designations for autonomous subdivisions of list of colleges and universities in Portugal .
The total adult literacy rate is 99.4 per cent . Portuguese primary school enrolments are 100 per cent .
According to the Programme for International Student Assessment ( PISA ) 2015 , the average Portuguese 15-year-old student , when rated in terms of reading literacy , mathematics and science knowledge , is placed significantly above the OECD 's average , at a similar level as those students from Norway , Denmark and Belgium , with 501 points ( 493 is the average ) . The PISA results of the Portuguese students have been continuously improving , overcoming a number of other highly developed western countries like the US , Austria , France and Sweden .
About 46,9 % of college-age citizens ( 20 years old ) attend one of Portugal 's higher education institutions ( compared with 50 % in the United States and 35 % in the OECD countries ) . In addition to being a destination for international students , Portugal is also among the top places of origin for international students . All higher education students , both domestic and international , totalled 380,937 in 2005.
Portuguese universities have existed since 1290 . The University of Coimbra was first established in Lisbon before moving to Coimbra . Historically , within the scope of the Portuguese Empire , the Portuguese founded the oldest engineering school of the Americas ( the Real Academia de Artilharia , Fortificao e Desenho of Rio de Janeiro ) in 1792 , as well as the oldest medical college in Asia ( the Escola Mdico-Cirrgica de Goa Escola Mdico-Cirrgica of Goa ) in 1842 . Presently , the largest university in Portugal is the University of Lisbon .
The Bologna process has been adopted by Portuguese universities and poly-technical institutes in 2006 . Higher education in state-run educational establishments is provided on a competitive basis , a system of numerus clausus is enforced through a national database on student admissions . However , every higher education institution offers also a number of additional vacant places through other extraordinary admission processes for sportsmen , mature applicants ( over 23 years old ) , international students , foreign students from the Lusosphere , degree owners from other institutions , students from other institutions ( Transfer admissions in the United States ) , former students ( readmission ) , and course change , which are subject to specific standards and regulations set by each institution or course department .
Most student costs are supported with public money . However , with the increasing tuition fees a student has to pay to attend a Portuguese state-run higher education institution and the attraction of new types of students ( many as part-time students or in evening classes ) like employees , businessmen , parents , and pensioners , many departments make a substantial profit from every additional student enrolled in courses , with benefits for the college or university 's gross tuition revenue and without loss of educational quality ( teacher per student , computer per student , classroom size per student , etc. ) .
Portugal has entered into Higher education in Portugal # International partnership agreements to further develop and increase the effectiveness of Portuguese higher education and research .
=== Health ===
According to the Human Development Report , the average life expectancy in Portugal had reached 82 years in 2017 , in 2020 it is estimated at 82.11 years . As projected by the United Nations , the life expectancy of the Portuguese population will be over 90 years when we reach 2100 . The trajectory of the Portuguese life expectancy is visualized with historical data from 1950 and future projections up to 2100 , as can be seen in the graph on the left .
Portugal ranks 12th in the best public health systems in the world , ahead of other countries like the United Kingdom , Germany or Sweden .
The Portuguese health system is characterized by three coexisting systems : the National Health Service ( Servio Nacional de Sade , SNS ) , special social health insurance schemes for certain professions ( health subsystems ) and voluntary private health insurance . The SNS provides universal coverage . In addition , about 25 % of the population is covered by the health subsystems , 10 % by private insurance schemes and another 7 % by mutual funds .
The Ministry of Health is responsible for developing health policy as well as managing the SNS . Five regional health administrations are in charge of implementing the national health policy objectives , developing guidelines and protocols and supervising health care delivery . Decentralization efforts have aimed at shifting financial and management responsibility to the regional level . In practice , however , the autonomy of regional health administrations over budget setting and spending has been limited to primary care .
The SNS is predominantly funded through general taxation . Employer ( including the state ) and employee contributions represent the main funding sources of the health subsystems . In addition , direct payments by the patient and voluntary health insurance premiums account for a large proportion of funding .
Similar to the other Eur-A countries , most Portuguese die from noncommunicable diseases . Mortality from cardiovascular diseases ( CVD ) is higher than in the eurozone , but its two main components , ischaemic heart disease and cerebrovascular disease , display inverse trends compared with the Eur-A , with cerebrovascular disease being the single biggest killer in Portugal ( 17 % ) . Portuguese people die 12 % less often from cancer than in the Eur-A , but mortality is not declining as rapidly as in the Eur-A . Cancer is more frequent among children as well as among women younger than 44 years . Although lung cancer ( slowly increasing among women ) and breast cancer ( decreasing rapidly ) are scarcer , cervical cancer and prostate cancer are more frequent .
Portugal has the highest mortality rate for diabetes in the Eur-A , with a sharp increase since the 1980s .
Portugal 's infant mortality rate is around 2 deaths per 1000 newborns , with 2.4 deaths per 1000 live births .
People are usually well informed about their health status , the positive and negative effects of their behaviour on their health , and their use of health care services . Yet their perceptions of their health , can differ from what administrative and examination-based data show about levels of illness within populations . Thus , survey results based on self-reporting at household level , complement other data on health status and the use of services .
Only one third of adults rated their health as good or very good in Portugal ( Kasmel et al. , 2004 ) . This is the lowest of the Eur-A countries reporting and reflects the relatively adverse situation of the country in terms of mortality and selected morbidity.Hospital de Santa Maria is the largest university hospital in Portugal .

Nauru ( or ; Naoero ) , officially the Republic of Nauru ( Repubrikin Naoero ) and formerly known as Pleasant Island , is an island country and microstate in Oceania , in the Pacific Ocean . Its nearest neighbour is Banaba Island in Kiribati , to the east . It further lies northwest of Tuvalu , northeast of the Solomon Islands , east-northeast of Papua New Guinea , southeast of the Federated States of Micronesia and south of the Marshall Islands . With only a area , Nauru is the list of countries and dependencies by area third-smallest country in the world behind Vatican City and Monaco , making it the smallest republic . Additionally , its population of is list of countries and dependencies by population the world 's second smallest , after Vatican City .
Settled by people from Micronesia and Polynesia , Nauru was annexation and claimed as a colony by the German Empire in the late 19th century . After World War ; I , Nauru became a League of Nations mandate administered by Australia , New Zealand , and the United Kingdom . During World War ; II , Nauru was occupied by Empire of Japan troops , and was leapfrogging ( strategy ) by the Allied advance across the Pacific . After the war ended , the country entered into United Nations trust territories . Nauru gained its independence in 1968 , and became a member of the Pacific Community ( SPC ) in 1969.
Nauru is a Phosphorite phosphate-rock island with rich deposits near the surface , which allowed easy Surface mining operations . Its remaining phosphate resources are not economically viable for extraction . When the phosphate reserves were exhausted , and the island 's environment had been seriously harmed by mining , the trust that had been established to manage the island 's wealth diminished in value . To earn income , Nauru briefly became a tax haven and illegal money laundering centre . From 2001 to 2008 , and again from 2012 , it accepted aid from the Government of Australia in exchange for hosting the Nauru Regional Processing Centre , a controversial Australian immigration detention facilities . As a result of heavy dependence on Australia , some sources have identified Nauru as a client state of Australia . The sovereign state is a member of the United Nations , Commonwealth of Nations and the African , Caribbean , and Pacific Group of States .
== History ==
Nauru was first inhabited by Micronesians and Polynesians at least 3,000 years ago . There were traditionally 12 clans or tribes on Nauru , which are represented in the twelve-pointed star on the flag of Nauru country 's flag . Traditionally , Nauruans traced their descent Matrilineality . Inhabitants practised aquaculture : they caught juvenile Milkfish , acclimatization them to freshwater , and raised them in the Buada Lagoon , providing a reliable food source . The other locally grown components of their diet included coconuts and pandanus tectorius . The name `` Nauru '' may derive from the Nauruan language word Anoero , which means ' I go to the beach . '
In 1798 , the British sea captain John Fearn ( whaler ) , on his trading ship Hunter ( 300 tons ) , became the first Westerner to report sighting Nauru , calling it `` Pleasant Island '' , because of its attractive appearance . From at least 1826 , Nauruans had regular contact with Europeans on whaling and trading ships who called for provisions and fresh drinking water . The last whaler to call during the age of sail visited in 1904.
Around this time , deserters from European ships began to live on the island . The islanders traded food for alcoholic palm wine and firearms . The firearms were used during the 10-year Nauruan Civil War that began in 1878.
After an Anglo-German Declarations about the Western Pacific Ocean , Nauru was annexed by Germany in 1888 and incorporated into Germany 's Marshall Islands Protectorate for administrative purposes . The arrival of the Germans ended the civil war , and kings were established as rulers of the island . The most widely known of these was King Aweida . Christian missionaries from the Gilbert Islands arrived in 1888 . The German settlers called the island `` Nawodo '' or `` Onawero '' . The Germans ruled Nauru for almost three decades . Robert Rasch , a German trader who married a Nauruan woman , was the first administrator , appointed in 1890.
Phosphate was discovered on Nauru in 1900 by the prospector Albert Fuller Ellis . The Pacific Phosphate Company began to exploit the reserves in 1906 by agreement with Germany , exporting its first shipment in 1907 . In 1914 , following the outbreak of World War I , Nauru was captured by Australian troops . In 1919 it was agreed by the Allies of World War I that George V should be the administering authority under a League of Nations mandate . The Nauru Island Agreement forged in 1919 between the governments of the United Kingdom , Australia , and New Zealand provided for the administration of the island and extraction of the phosphate deposits by an intergovernmental British Phosphate Commission ( BPC ) . The terms of the League of Nations mandate were drawn up in 1920.
The island experienced an influenza epidemic in 1920 , with a mortality rate of 18 per cent among native Nauruans .
In 1923 , the League of Nations gave Australia a trustee mandate over Nauru , with the United Kingdom and New Zealand as co-trustees . On 6 ; and 7 December 1940 , the German auxiliary cruisers German auxiliary cruiser Komet and German auxiliary cruiser Orion German attacks on Nauru in the vicinity of Nauru . Komet then shelled Nauru 's phosphate mining areas , oil storage depots , and the shiploading cantilever .
Empire of Japan troops Japanese occupation of Nauru on 25 August 1942 . The Japanese built an airfield which was bombed for the first time on 25 March 1943 , preventing food supplies from being flown to Nauru . The Japanese deported 1,200 Nauruans to work as labourers in the Chuuk Islands , which was also occupied by Japan . As part of the Allied strategy of Leapfrogging ( strategy ) from the Pacific islands towards the main islands of Japan , Nauru was bypassed and left to `` wither on the vine '' . Nauru was finally liberated on 13 September 1945 , when commander Hisayaki Soeda surrendered the island to the Australian Army and the Royal Australian Navy . The surrender was accepted by Brigadier John Rowlstone Stevenson J. R. Stevenson , who represented Lieutenant general ( Australia ) Vernon Sturdee , the commander of the First Australian Army , aboard the warship HMAS Diamantina ( K377 ) . Arrangements were made to repatriate from Chuuk the 737 ; Nauruans who survived Japanese captivity there . They were returned to Nauru by the BPC ship Trienza in January 1946.
In 1947 , a United Nations trust territory was established by the United Nations , with Australia , New Zealand , and the United Kingdom as trustees . Under those arrangements , the UK , Australia , and New Zealand were a joint administering authority . The Nauru Island Agreement provided for the first administrator to be appointed by Australia for five years , leaving subsequent appointments to be decided by the three governments . However , in practice , administrative power was exercised by Australia alone .
In 1948 , Chinese guano mining workers went on strike over pay and conditions . The Australian administration imposed a state of emergency with Native Police and armed volunteers of locals and Australian officials being mobilised . This force , using sub-machine guns and other firearms , opened fire on the Chinese workers killing two and wounding sixteen . Around 50 of the workers were arrested and two of these were bayoneted to death while in custody . The trooper who bayoneted the prisoners was charged but later acquitted on grounds that the wounds were `` accidentally received . '' The governments of the Soviet Union and China made official complaints against Australia at the United Nations over this incident .
In 1964 , it was proposed to relocate the population of Nauru to Curtis Island ( Queensland ) off the coast of Queensland , Australia . By that time , Nauru had been extensively mined for phosphate by companies from Australia , Britain and New Zealand damaging the landscape so much that it was thought the island would be uninhabitable by the 1990s . Rehabilitating the island was seen as financially impossible . In 1962 , Prime Minister of Australia , Robert Menzies , said that the three countries involved in the mining had an obligation to provide a solution for the Nauruan people , and proposed finding a new island for them . In 1963 , the Australian Government proposed to acquire all the land on Curtis Island ( which was considerably larger than Nauru ) and then offer the Nauruans freehold title over the island and that the Nauruans would become Australian citizens . The cost of resettling the Nauruans on Curtis Island was estimated to be , which included housing and infrastructure and the establishment of pastoral , agricultural , and fishing industries . However , the Nauruan people did not wish to become Australian citizens and wanted to be given sovereignty over Curtis Island to establish themselves as an independent nation , which Australia would not agree to . Nauru rejected the proposal to move to Curtis Island , instead choosing to become an independent nation operating their mines in Nauru .
Nauru became self-governing in January 1966 , and following a two-year constitutional convention , it became independent on 31 January 1968 under founding president Hammer DeRoburt . In 1967 , the people of Nauru purchased the assets of the British Phosphate Commissioners , and in June 1970 control passed to the locally owned Nauru Phosphate Corporation ( NPC ) . Income from the mines made Nauruans among the richest people in the world . In 1989 , Nauru took legal action against Australia in the International Court of Justice over Australia 's administration of the island , in particular , Australia 's failure to remedy the environmental damage caused by phosphate mining . Certain Phosphate Lands : Nauru v. ; Australia led to an out-of-court settlement to rehabilitate the mined-out areas of Nauru .
== Geography ==
Nauru is a , oval-shaped island in the southwestern Pacific Ocean , south of the equator . The island is surrounded by a coral reef , which is exposed at low tide and dotted with pinnacles . The presence of the reef has prevented the establishment of a port , although canals in Nauru in the reef allow small boats access to the island . A fertile coastal strip wide lies inland from the beach .
Coral cliffs surround Nauru 's central plateau . The highest point of the plateau , called the Command Ridge , is above sea level .
The only fertile areas on Nauru are on the narrow coastal belt where coconut palms flourish . The land around Buada Lagoon supports bananas , pineapples , vegetables , pandanus tectorius , and indigenous hardwoods , such as the calophyllum inophyllum .
Nauru was one of three great Phosphorite islands in the Pacific Ocean , along with Banaba Island ( Ocean Island ) , in Kiribati , and Makatea , in French Polynesia . The phosphate reserves on Nauru are now almost entirely depleted . Phosphate mining in the central plateau has left a barren terrain of jagged limestone pinnacles up to high . Mining has stripped and devastated about 80 per cent of Nauru 's land area , leaving it uninhabitable , and has also affected the surrounding exclusive economic zone ; 40 per cent of marine life is estimated to have been killed by silt and phosphate runoff .
There are limited natural sources of freshwater on Nauru . Rooftop Rainwater tank collect rainwater . The islanders are mostly dependent on three desalination plants housed at Nauru 's Utilities Agency .
=== Climate ===
Nauru 's climate is hot and very humid year-round because of its proximity to the equator and the ocean . Nauru is hit by monsoon rains between November and February , but rarely has cyclones . Annual rainfall is highly variable and is influenced by the El NioSouthern Oscillation , with several significant recorded droughts . The temperature on Nauru ranges between during the day and is quite stable at around at night .
Streams and rivers do not exist in Nauru . Water is gathered from roof catchment systems . Water is brought to Nauru as ballast on ships returning for loads of phosphate .
=== Ecology ===
Fauna is sparse on the island because of a lack of vegetation and the consequences of phosphates mining . Many indigenous birds have disappeared or become rare owing to the destruction of their habitat . There are about 60 ; recorded vascular plant ] species native to the island , none of which are [ [ Endemism . Coconut farming , mining , and introduced species have seriously disturbed the native vegetation .
There are no native land mammals , but there are native insects , land crabs , and birds , including the endemic Nauru reed warbler . The Polynesian rat , cats , dogs , pigs , and chickens have been introduced to Nauru from ships . The diversity of the reef marine life makes fishing a popular activity for tourists on the island ; also popular are scuba diving and Snorkeling .
== Politics ==
The president of Nauru is Lionel Aingimea , who heads a 19-member unicameralism parliament . The country is a member of the United Nations , the Commonwealth of Nations , and the Asian Development Bank . Nauru also participates in the Commonwealth Games and Olympic Games . Recently Nauru became a member country of the International Renewable Energy Agency ( IRENA ) . The Republic of Nauru became the 189th member of the International Monetary Fund in April 2016.
Nauru is a republic with a parliamentary system of government . The president is both [ of state ] and [ of government ] and is dependent on parliamentary confidence to remain president . A 19-member unicameral parliament is elected every three years . The parliament elects the president from its members , and the president appoints a cabinet of five to six members .
Nauru does not have any formal structure for political parties , and candidates typically stand for office as independents ; fifteen of the 19 ; members of the current Parliament are independents . Four parties that have been active in Nauruan politics are the Nauru Party , the Democratic Party of Nauru , Nauru First and the Centre Party ( Nauru ) . However , alliances within the government are often formed based on extended family ties rather than party affiliation .
From 1992 to 1999 , Nauru had a local government system known as the Nauru Island Council ( NIC ) . This nine-member council was designed to provide municipal services . The NIC was dissolved in 1999 and all assets and liabilities became vested in the national government . Land tenure on Nauru is unusual : all Nauruans have certain rights to all land on the island , which is owned by individuals and family groups . Government and corporate entities do not own any land , and they must enter into a lease arrangement with landowners to use land . Non-Nauruans can not own land on the island .
Nauru had 17 ; changes of administration between 1989 and 2003 . Bernard Dowiyogo died in office in March 2003 and Ludwig Scotty was elected as the president , later being re-elected to serve a full term in October 2004 .

Its Supreme Court of Nauru , headed by the Chief Justice , is paramount on constitution of Nauru . Other cases can be appealed to the two-judge Appellate Court . Parliament can not overturn court decisions . Historically , Appellate Court rulings could be appealed to the High Court of Australia , though this happened only rarely and the Australian court 's appellate jurisdiction ended entirely on 12 March 2018 after the Government of Nauru unilaterally ended the arrangement . Lower courts consist of the District Court and the Family Court , both of which are headed by a Resident Magistrate , who also is the Registrar of the Supreme Court . There are two other quasi-courts : the Public Service Appeal Board and the Police Appeal Board , both of which are presided over by the Chief Justice .
=== Foreign relations ===
Following independence in 1968 , Nauru joined the Commonwealth of Nations as a Special Member ; it became a full member in 1999 . The country was admitted to the Asian Development Bank in 1991 and the United Nations in 1999 . Nauru is a member of the South Pacific Regional Environment Programme , the South Pacific Commission , and the South Pacific Applied Geoscience Commission . In February 2021 , Nauru announced it would be formally withdrawing from the Pacific Islands Forum in a joint statement with Marshall Islands , Kiribati , and the Federated States of Micronesia after a dispute regarding Henry Puna 's election as the Forum 's secretary-general .
Nauru List of countries without armed forces , though there is a small police force under civilian control . Australia is responsible for Nauru 's defence under an informal agreement between the two countries . The September 2005 memorandum of understanding between Australia and Nauru provides the latter with financial aid and technical assistance , including a Secretary of Finance to prepare the budget , and advisers on health and education . This aid is in return for Nauru 's housing of asylum seekers while their applications for entry into Australia are processed . Nauru uses the Australian dollar as its official currency .
Nauru has used its position as a member of the United Nations to gain financial support from both Taiwan ( officially the Republic of China or ROC ) and mainland China ( officially the People 's Republic of China or PRC ) by changing its recognition from one to the other under the One-China policy . On 21 July 2002 , Nauru signed an agreement to establish diplomatic relations with the PRC , accepting US $ 130 ; million from the PRC for this action . In response , the ROC severed diplomatic relations with Nauru two days later . Nauru later re-established links with the ROC on 14 May 2005 , and diplomatic ties with the PRC were officially severed on 31 May 2005 . However , the PRC continues to maintain a representative office on Nauru .
In 2008 , Nauru recognised Kosovo as an independent country , and in 2009 Nauru became the fourth country , after Russia , Nicaragua , and Venezuela , to recognise Abkhazia , a breakaway region of Georgia ( country ) . Russia was reported to be giving Nauru US $ 50 ; million in humanitarian aid as a result of this recognition . On 15 July 2008 , the Nauruan government announced a port refurbishment programme , financed with US $ 9 ; million of development aid received from Russia . The Nauru government claims this aid is not related to its recognising Abkhazia and South Ossetia .
A significant portion of Nauru 's income has been in the form of aid from Australia . In 2001 , the MV Tampa , a Norwegian ship that had rescued 438 ; refugees from a stranded 20-metre-long boat , was seeking to dock in Australia . In what became known as Tampa affair , the ship was refused entry and boarded by Australian troops . The refugees were eventually loaded onto Royal Australian Navy vessel HMAS Manoora and taken to Nauru to be held in detention facilities which later became part of the Howard government 's Pacific Solution . Nauru operated two Nauru Regional Processing Centre for these refugees in exchange for Australian aid . By November 2005 , only two refugees , Mohammed Sagar and Muhammad Faisal remained on Nauru from those first sent there in 2001 , with Sagar finally resettling in early 2007 . The Australian government sent further groups of asylum-seekers to Nauru in late 2006 and early 2007 . The refugee centre was closed in 2008 , but , following the Australian government 's re-adoption of the Pacific Solution in August 2012 , it has re-opened it . The US Atmospheric Radiation Measurement Climate Research Facility program operates a climate-monitoring facility on the island .
In March 2017 , at the 34th regular session of the UN Human Rights Council , Vanuatu made a joint statement on behalf of Nauru and some other Pacific nations raising human rights violations in Western New Guinea , which has been occupied by Indonesia since 1963 , and requested that the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights produce a report . Indonesia rejected the allegations . More than 100,000 Papuans have died during a 50-year Papua conflict .
Amnesty International has since described the conditions of the refugees of war living in Nauru as a `` horror '' , with reports of children as young as eight attempting suicide and engaging in acts of self-harm . In 2018 , the situation gained attention as a `` mental health crisis '' , with an estimated thirty children suffering from traumatic withdrawal syndrome , also known as resignation syndrome . The condition is a deteriorating psychiatric condition wherein the sufferer can eventually become unresponsive and their body can begin to shut down . This condition has also been observed in other groups of asylum seekers .
=== Administrative divisions ===
Nauru is divided into fourteen administrative districts , which are grouped into constituencies of Nauru and are further divided into villages . The most populous district is Denigomodu , with 1,804 residents , of which 1,497 reside in an Nauru Phosphate Corporation settlement called `` Location '' . The following table shows population by district according to the 2011 census .

== Economy ==
The Nauruan economy peaked in the mid-1970s , when its GDP per capita was estimated to be US $ 50,000 , second only to Saudi Arabia . Most of this came from phosphate mining , which declined from the early 1980s . There are few other resources , and most necessities are imported . Small-scale mining is still conducted by RONPhos , formerly known as the Nauru Phosphate Corporation . The government places a percentage of RONPhos 's earnings into the Nauru Phosphate Royalties Trust . The trust manages long-term investments , which were intended to support the citizens after the phosphate reserves were exhausted .
Because of mismanagement , the trust 's fixed and current assets were reduced considerably and may never fully recover . The failed investments included financing Leonardo the Musical : A Portrait of Love in 1993 . The Mercure Hotel in Sydney and Nauru House in Melbourne were sold in 2004 to finance debts and Air Nauru 's only Boeing ; 737 was repossessed in December 2005 . Normal air service resumed after the aircraft was replaced with a Boeing 737-300 airliner in June 2006 . In 2005 , the corporation sold its remaining real estate in Melbourne , the vacant Savoy Tavern site , for $ 7.5 ; million .
The value of the trust is estimated to have shrunk from Australian dollar A $ 1.3 ; billion in 1991 to A $ 138 ; million in 2002 . Nauru currently lacks money to perform many of the basic functions of government ; for example , the National Bank of Nauru is insolvent . The CIA World Factbook estimated a List of countries by GDP ( PPP ) per capita of US $ 5,000 in 2005 . The Asian Development Bank 2007 economic report on Nauru estimated GDP per capita at US $ 2,400 to US $ 2,715 .
There are no personal taxes in Nauru . The unemployment rate is estimated to be 23 percent , and of those who have jobs , the government employs 95 per cent . The Asian Development Bank notes that , although the administration has a strong public mandate to implement economic reforms , in the absence of an alternative to phosphate mining , the medium-term outlook is for continued dependence on external assistance . Tourism in Nauru is not a major contributor to the economy .
In the 1990s , Nauru became a tax haven and offered passports to foreign nationals for a fee . The inter-governmental Financial Action Task Force on Money Laundering ( FATF ) identified Nauru as one of 15 `` FATF Blacklist non-cooperative '' countries in its fight against money laundering . During the 1990s , it was possible to establish a licensed bank in Nauru for only US $ 25,000 with no other requirements . Under pressure from FATF , Nauru introduced anti-avoidance legislation in 2003 , after which foreign [ money ] left the country . In October 2005 , after satisfactory results from the legislation and its enforcement , FATF lifted the non-cooperative designation .
From 2001 to 2007 , the Nauru detention centre provided a significant source of income for the country . The Nauruan authorities reacted with concern to its closure by Australia . In February 2008 , the Foreign Affairs minister , Dr Kieren Keke , stated that the closure would result in 100 ; Nauruans losing their jobs , and would affect 10 ; per cent of the island 's population directly or indirectly : `` We have got a huge number of families that are suddenly going to be without any income . We are looking at ways we can try and provide some welfare assistance but our capacity to do that is very limited . Literally we have got a major unemployment crisis in front of us . '' The detention centre was re-opened in August 2012.
In July 2017 the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development ( OECD ) upgraded its rating of Nauru 's standards of tax transparency . Previously Nauru had been listed alongside fourteen other countries that had failed to show that they could comply with international tax transparency standards and regulations . The OECD subsequently put Nauru through a fast-tracked compliance process and the country was given a `` largely compliant '' rating .
The Nauru 20172018 budget , delivered by Minister for Finance David Adeang , forecasted A $ 128.7 ; million in revenues and A $ 128.6 ; million in expenditures and projected modest economic growth for the nation over the next two years .

== Culture ==
Angam Day , held on 26 October , celebrates the recovery of the Nauruan population after the two World Wars and the 1920 influenza epidemic .

About half of Egypt 's residents live in urban areas , with most spread across the densely populated centres of greater Cairo , Alexandria and other major cities in the Nile Delta .
Egypt is considered to be a regional power in North Africa , the Middle East and the Muslim world , and a middle power worldwide .

== History ==
=== Prehistory and Ancient Egypt ===
There is evidence of rock carvings along the Nile terraces and in desert oases . In the 10th millennium BCE , a culture of [ and fishing fishers ] was replaced by a [ [ cereal-grinding culture . Climate changes or overgrazing around 8000 BCE began to desiccate the pastoral lands of Egypt , forming the Sahara . Early tribal peoples migrated to the Nile River where they developed a settled agricultural Economic system and more centralised society .
By about 6000 BCE , a Neolithic culture rooted in the Nile Valley . During the Neolithic era , several predynastic cultures developed independently in Upper and Lower Egypt . The Badarian culture and the successor Naqada series are generally regarded as precursors to Ancient Egypt . The earliest known Lower Egyptian site , Merimda , predates the Badarian by about seven hundred years . Contemporaneous Lower Egyptian communities coexisted with their southern counterparts for more than two thousand years , remaining culturally distinct , but maintaining frequent contact through trade . The earliest known evidence of Egyptian hieroglyphs inscriptions appeared during the predynastic period on Naqada III pottery vessels , dated to about 3200 BCE .
A unified kingdom was founded c. 3150 BCE by King Menes , leading to a List of Egyptian dynasties that ruled Egypt for the next three millennia . Culture of Egypt flourished during this long period and remained distinctively Egyptian in its Ancient Egyptian religion , Art of Ancient Egypt , Egyptian language and customs . The Protodynastic Period of Egypt of a unified Egypt set the stage for the Old Kingdom period , c. 27002200 BCE , which constructed many Egyptian pyramids , most notably the Third dynasty of Egypt pyramid of Djoser and the Fourth dynasty of Egypt Giza Necropolis .
The First Intermediate Period of Egypt ushered in a time of political upheaval for about 150 years . Stronger Nile floods and stabilisation of government , however , brought back renewed prosperity for the country in the Middle Kingdom of Egypt c. 2040 BCE , reaching a peak during the reign of Pharaoh Amenemhat III . A Second Intermediate Period of Egypt heralded the arrival of the first foreign ruling dynasty in Egypt , that of the Semitic Hyksos . The Hyksos invaders took over much of Lower Egypt around 1650 BCE and founded a new capital at Avaris . They were driven out by an Upper Egyptian force led by Ahmose I , who founded the Eighteenth dynasty of Egypt and relocated the capital from Memphis , Egypt to Thebes , Egypt .
The New Kingdom c. 15501070 BCE began with the Eighteenth Dynasty , marking the rise of Egypt as an Power in international relations that expanded during its greatest extension to an empire as far south as Tombos ( Nubia ) in Nubia , and included parts of the Levant in the east . This period is noted for some of the most well known Pharaohs , including Hatshepsut , Thutmose III , Akhenaten and his wife Nefertiti , Tutankhamun and Ramesses II . The first historically attested expression of monotheism came during this period as Atenism . Frequent contacts with other nations brought new ideas to the New Kingdom . The country was later invaded and conquered by Ancient Libya , Kingdom of Kush and Assyrians , but native Egyptians eventually drove them out and regained control of their country .
==== Achaemenid Egypt ====
In 525 ; BCE , the powerful Achaemenid Empire , led by Cambyses II of Persia , began their conquest of Egypt , eventually capturing the pharaoh Psamtik III at the battle of Pelusium . Cambyses II then assumed the formal title of pharaoh , but ruled Egypt from his home of Susa in Persia ( modern Iran ) , leaving Egypt under the control of a satrapy . The entire Twenty-seventh Dynasty of Egypt , from 525 to 402 BCE , save for Petubastis III , was an entirely Persian ruled period , with the Achaemenid Emperors all being granted the title of pharaoh . A few temporarily successful revolts against the Persians marked the fifth century BCE , but Egypt was never able to permanently overthrow the Persians .
The Thirtieth dynasty of Egypt was the last native ruling dynasty during the Pharaonic epoch . It History of Achaemenid Egypt in 343 BCE after the last native Pharaoh , King Nectanebo II , was defeated in battle . This Thirty-first Dynasty of Egypt , however , did not last long , for the Persians were toppled several decades later by Alexander the Great . The Macedonian Greek general of Alexander , Ptolemy I Soter , founded the Ptolemaic dynasty .
=== Ptolemaic and Roman Egypt ===
The Ptolemaic Kingdom was a powerful Hellenistic civilization state , extending from southern Syria in the east , to Cyrene , Libya to the west , and south to the frontier with Nubia . Alexandria became the capital city and a centre of Hellenistic Greece culture and trade . To gain recognition by the native Egyptian populace , they named themselves as the successors to the Pharaohs . The later Ptolemies took on Egyptian traditions , had themselves portrayed on public monuments in Egyptian style and dress , and participated in Egyptian religious life .
The last ruler from the Ptolemaic dynasty line was Cleopatra VII , who committed suicide following the burial of her lover Mark Antony who had died in her arms ( from a self-inflicted stab wound ) , after Octavian had captured Alexandria and her mercenary forces had fled .
The Ptolemies faced rebellions of native Egyptians often caused by an unwanted regime and were involved in foreign and civil wars that led to the decline of the kingdom and its annexation by Rome . Nevertheless , Hellenistic culture continued to thrive in Egypt well after the Muslim conquest of Egypt .
Christianity was brought to Egypt by Saint Mark the Evangelist in the 1st century . Diocletian 's reign ( 284305 CE ) marked the transition from the Roman Empire to the Byzantine Empire era in Egypt , when a great number of Egyptian Christians were persecuted . The New Testament had by then been translated into Egyptian . After the Council of Chalcedon in CE 451 , a distinct Coptic Orthodox Church of Alexandria was firmly established .
=== Middle Ages ( 7th century  1517 ) ===
The Byzantines were able to regain control of the country after a brief Aegyptus ( Roman province ) # Persian and Arab conquests invasion early in the 7th century amidst the ByzantineSasanian War of 602628 during which they established a new short-lived province for ten years known as Sasanian Egypt , until 63942 , when Egypt was invaded and
Muslim conquest of Egypt by the Muslim Arabs . When they defeated the Byzantine armies in Egypt , the Arabs brought Sunni Islam to the country . Early in this period , Egyptians began to blend their new faith with indigenous beliefs and practices , leading to various Sufism orders that have flourished to this day . These earlier rites had survived the period of Coptic Orthodox Church of Alexandria .
In 639 an army of some 4,000 men were sent against Egypt by the second caliph , Umar , under the command of Amr ibn al-As . This army was joined by another 5,000 men in 640 and defeated a Byzantine army at the battle of Heliopolis . Amr next proceeded in the direction of Alexandria , which was surrendered to him by a treaty signed on 8 November 641 . Alexandria was regained for the Byzantine Empire in 645 but was retaken by Amr in 646 . In 654 an invasion fleet sent by Constans II was repulsed . From that time no serious effort was made by the Byzantines to regain possession of the country .
The Arabs founded the capital of Egypt called Fustat , which was later burned down during the Crusades . Cairo was later built in the year 986 to grow to become the largest and richest city in the Arab Empire , and one of the biggest and richest in the world .
==== Abbasid period ====
The Abbasid period was marked by new taxations , and the Copts revolted again in the fourth year of Abbasid rule . At the beginning of the 9th century the practice of ruling Egypt through a governor was resumed under Abdallah ibn Tahir , who decided to reside at Baghdad , sending a deputy to Egypt to govern for him . In 828 another Egyptian revolt broke out , and in 831 the Copts joined with native Muslims against the government . Eventually the power loss of the Abbasids in Baghdad has led for general upon general to take over rule of Egypt , yet being under Abbasid allegiance , the Tulunid dynasty ( 868905 ) and Ikhshidid dynasty ( 935969 ) were among the most successful to defy the Abbasid Caliph .
==== The Fatimid Caliphate and the Mamluks ====
Muslim rulers nominated by the Caliphate remained in History of Arab Egypt for the next six centuries , with Cairo as the seat of the Fatimid Caliphate . With the end of the Kurdish people Ayyubid dynasty , the Mamluks , a Turkic people-Circassians military caste , took control about 1250 . By the late 13th century , Egypt linked the Red Sea , India , Malaya , and East Indies . The mid-14th-century Black Death killed about 40 % of the country 's population .
=== Early modern : Ottoman Egypt ( 15171867 ) ===
Egypt was conquered by the Ottoman Turks in 1517 , after which it became a province of the Ottoman Empire . The defensive militarisation damaged its civil society and economic institutions . The weakening of the economic system combined with the effects of plague left Egypt vulnerable to foreign invasion . Portuguese traders took over their trade . Between 1687 and 1731 , Egypt experienced six famines . The 1784 famine cost it roughly one-sixth of its population .
Egypt was always a difficult province for the Ottoman Sultans to control , due in part to the continuing power and influence of the Mamluks , the Egyptian military caste who had ruled the country for centuries .
Egypt remained semi-autonomous under the Mamluks until it was invaded by the First French Republic forces of Napoleon Bonaparte in 1798 ( see French campaign in Egypt and Syria ) . After the French were defeated by the British , a power vacuum was created in Egypt , and a three-way power struggle ensued between the Ottoman Turks , Egyptian Mamluks who had ruled Egypt for centuries , and Arnauts in the service of the Ottomans .
==== The Muhammad Ali dynasty ====
After the French were expelled , power was seized in 1805 by Muhammad Ali of Egypt , an Albanians in Egypt military commander of the Ottoman army in Egypt . While he carried the title of viceroy of Egypt , his subordination to the Ottoman porte was merely nominal . Muhammad Ali Muhammad Ali 's seizure of power the Mamluks and established a Muhammad Ali dynasty that was to rule Egypt until the revolution of 1952.
The introduction in 1820 of long-staple cotton transformed its agriculture into a cash-crop monoculture before the end of the century , concentrating land ownership and shifting production towards international markets .
Muhammad Ali annexed Northern Sudan ( 18201824 ) , Syria ( 1833 ) , and parts of Arabian Peninsula and Anatolia ; but in 1841 the European powers , fearful lest he topple the Ottoman Empire itself , forced him to return most of his conquests to the Ottomans . His military ambition required him to modernise the country : he built industries , a system of canals for irrigation and transport , and reformed the civil service .
He constructed a military state with around four percent of the populace serving the army to raise Egypt to a powerful positioning in the Ottoman Empire in a way showing various similarities to the Soviet strategies ( without communism ) conducted in the 20th century .
Muhammad Ali Pasha evolved the military from one that convened under the tradition of the corve to a great modernised army . He introduced conscription of the male peasantry in 19th century Egypt , and took a novel approach to create his great army , strengthening it with numbers and in skill . Education and training of the new soldiers became mandatory ; the new concepts were furthermore enforced by isolation . The men were held in barracks to avoid distraction of their growth as a military unit to be reckoned with . The resentment for the military way of life eventually faded from the men and a new ideology took hold , one of nationalism and pride . It was with the help of this newly reborn martial unit that Muhammad Ali imposed his rule over Egypt .
The policy that Mohammad Ali Pasha followed during his reign explains partly why the numeracy in Egypt compared to other North-African and Middle-Eastern countries increased only at a remarkably small rate , as investment in further education only took place in the military and industrial sector .
Muhammad Ali was succeeded briefly by his son Ibrahim Pasha of Egypt ( in September 1848 ) , then by a grandson Abbas I of Egypt ( in November 1848 ) , then by Sa'id of Egypt ( in 1854 ) , and Isma'il Pasha Isma'il ( in 1863 ) who encouraged science and agriculture and banned slavery in Egypt .
=== Khedivate of Egypt ( 18671914 ) ===
History of Egypt under the Muhammad Ali dynasty remained nominally an Ottoman province . It was granted the status of an Vassal and tributary states of the Ottoman Empire or Khedivate of Egypt in 1867 , a legal status which was to remain in place until 1914 although the Ottomans had no power or presence .
The Suez Canal , built in partnership with the French , was completed in 1869 . Its construction was financed by European banks . Large sums also went to patronage and corruption . New taxes caused popular discontent . In 1875 Isma'il avoided bankruptcy by selling all Egypt 's shares in the canal to the British government . Within three years this led to the imposition of British and French Dual control ( politics ) who sat in the Egyptian cabinet , and , `` with the financial power of the bondholders behind them , were the real power in the Government . ''
Other circumstances like epidemic diseases ( cattle disease in the 1880s ) , floods and wars drove the economic downturn and increased Egypt 's dependency on foreign debt even further .
Local dissatisfaction with the Khedive and with European intrusion led to the formation of the first nationalist groupings in 1879 , with Ahmed Urabi a prominent figure . After increasing tensions and nationalist revolts , the United Kingdom invaded Egypt in 1882 , crushing the Egyptian army at the Battle of Tell El Kebir and militarily occupying the country . Following this , the Khedivate became a de facto British protectorate under nominal Ottoman sovereignty .
In 1899 the Anglo-Egyptian Condominium Agreement was signed : the Agreement stated that Sudan would be jointly governed by the Khedivate of Egypt and the United Kingdom . However , actual control of Sudan was in British hands only .
In 1906 , the Denshawai incident prompted many neutral Egyptians to join the nationalist movement .
=== Sultanate of Egypt ( 19141922 ) ===
In 1914 the Ottoman Empire entered World War I in alliance with the Central Empires ; Khedive Abbas II of Egypt ( who had grown increasingly hostile to the British in preceding years ) decided to support the motherland in war . Following such decision , the British forcibly removed him from power and replaced him with his brother Hussein Kamel of Egypt .
Hussein Kamel declared Egypt 's independence from the Ottoman Empire , assuming the title of Sultanate of Egypt . Shortly following independence , Egypt was declared a protectorate of the United Kingdom .
After World War I , Saad Zaghlul and the Wafd Party led the Egyptian nationalist movement to a majority at the local Legislative Assembly . When the British exiled Zaghlul and his associates to Malta on 8 March 1919 , the country arose in its Egyptian revolution of 1919 . The revolt led the United Kingdom coalition government ( 19161922 ) to issue a Unilateral Declaration of Egyptian Independence unilateral declaration of Egypt 's independence on 22 February 1922.
=== Kingdom of Egypt ( 19221953 ) ===
Following independence from the United Kingdom , Sultan Fuad I of Egypt assumed the title of Kingdom of Egypt ; despite being nominally independent , the Kingdom was still under British military occupation and the UK still had great influence over the state .
The Kingdom of Egypt drafted and implemented a 1923 Constitution of Egypt in 1923 based on a Parliamentary system system . The nationalist Wafd Party won a landslide victory in the 192324 Egyptian parliamentary election 19231924 election and Saad Zaghloul was appointed as the new Prime Minister .
In 1936 , the Anglo-Egyptian Treaty of 1936 Anglo-Egyptian Treaty was concluded and British troops withdrew from Egypt , except for the Suez Canal . The treaty did not resolve the question of Anglo-Egyptian Sudan , which , under the terms of the existing Anglo-Egyptian Condominium Agreement of 1899 , stated that Sudan should be jointly governed by Egypt and Britain , but with real power remaining in British hands .
Britain used Egypt as a base for Allied operations throughout the region , especially the battles in North Africa against Italy and Germany . Its highest priorities were control of the Eastern Mediterranean , and especially keeping the Suez Canal open for merchant ships and for military connections with India and Australia . The government of Egypt , and the Egyptian population , played a minor role in the Second World War . When the war began in September 1939 , Egypt declared martial law and broke off diplomatic relations with Germany . It did not declare war on Germany , but the Prime Minister associated Egypt with the British war effort . It broke diplomatic relations with Italy in 1940 , but never declared war , even when the Italian army invaded Egypt . King Farouk took practically a neutral position , which accorded with elite opinion among the Egyptians . The Egyptian army did no fighting . It was apathetic about the war , with the leading officers looking on the British as occupiers and sometimes holding some private sympathy with the Axis . In June 1940 the King dismissed Prime Minister Aly Maher , who got on poorly with the British . A new coalition Government was formed with the Independent Hassan Pasha Sabri as Prime Minister .
Following a ministerial crisis in February 1942 , the ambassador Sir Miles Lampson , 1st Baron Killearn , pressed Farouk to have a Wafd Party or Wafd-coalition government replace Hussein Sirri Pasha 's government . On the night of 4 February 1942 , Abdeen Palace Incident of 1942 . Farouk capitulated , and Nahhas formed a government shortly thereafter . However , the humiliation meted out to Farouk , and the actions of the Wafd in cooperating with the British and taking power , lost support for both the British and the Wafd among both civilians and , more importantly , the Military of Egypt .
Most British troops were withdrawn to the Suez Canal area in 1947 ( although the British army maintained a military base in the area ) , but nationalist , anti-British feelings continued to grow after the War . Anti-monarchy sentiments further increased following the disastrous performance of the Kingdom in the First Arab-Israeli War . The 1950 election saw a landslide victory of the nationalist Wafd Party and the King was forced to appoint Mostafa El-Nahas as new Prime Minister . In 1951 Egypt unilaterally withdrew from the Anglo-Egyptian treaty of 1936 Anglo-Egyptian Treaty of 1936 and ordered all remaining British troops to leave the Suez Canal .
As the British refused to leave their base around the Suez Canal , the Egyptian government cut off the water and refused to allow food into the Suez Canal base , announced a boycott of British goods , forbade Egyptian workers from entering the base and sponsored guerrilla attacks , turning the area around the Suez Canal into a low level war zone . On 24 January 1952 , Egyptian guerrillas staged a fierce attack on the British forces around the Suez Canal , during which the Egyptian Auxiliary Police were observed helping the guerrillas . In response , on 25 January , General George Erskine sent out British tanks and infantry to surround the auxiliary police station in Ismailia and gave the policemen an hour to surrender their arms on the grounds the police were arming the guerrillas . The police commander called the Interior Minister , Fouad Serageddin , Nahas 's right-hand man , who was smoking cigars in his bath at the time , to ask if he should surrender or fight . Serageddin ordered the police to fight `` to the last man and the last bullet '' . The resulting battle saw the police station levelled and 43 Egyptian policemen killed together with 3 British soldiers . The Ismailia incident outraged Egypt . The next day , 26 January 1952 was Cairo fire `` Black Saturday '' , as the anti-British riot was known , that saw much of downtown Cairo which the Khedive Ismail the Magnificent had rebuilt in the style of Paris , burned down . Farouk blamed the Wafd for the Black Saturday riot , and dismissed Nahas as prime minister the next day . He was replaced by Aly Maher Pasha .
On July 2223 , 1952 , the Free Officers Movement ( Egypt ) , led by Muhammad Naguib and Gamal Abdel Nasser , launched a coup d'tat ( Egyptian Revolution of 1952 ) against the king . Farouk I abdicated the throne to his son Fuad II of Egypt , who was , at the time , a seven month old baby . The Royal Family left Egypt some days later and the Council of Regency , led by Prince Muhammad Abdel Moneim was formed , The council , however , held only nominal authority and the real power was actually in the hands of the Egyptian Revolutionary Command Council , led by Naguib and Nasser .
Popular expectations for immediate reforms led to the workers ' riots in Kafr Dawar on 12 August 1952 , which resulted in two death sentences . Following a brief experiment with civilian rule , the Free Officers abrogated the monarchy and the 1923 constitution and declared Egypt a republic on 18 June 1953 . Naguib was proclaimed as president , while Nasser was appointed as the new Prime Minister .
=== Republic of Egypt ( 19531958 ) ===
Following the Egyptian Revolution of 1952 by the Free Officers Movement ( Egypt ) , the rule of Egypt passed to military hands and all political parties were banned . On 18 June 1953 , the Egyptian Republic was declared , with General Muhammad Naguib as the first President of the Republic , serving in that capacity for a little under one and a half years .
==== President Nasser ( 19561970 ) ====
Naguib was forced to resign in 1954 by Gamal Abdel Nassera Pan-Arabist and the real architect of the 1952 movementand was later put under [ arrest ] . After Naguib 's resignation , the position of President was vacant until the election of Gamal Abdel Nasser in 1956.
In October 1954 Egypt and the United Kingdom agreed to abolish the Anglo-Egyptian Sudan Anglo-Egyptian Condominium Agreement of 1899 and grant Sudan independence ; the agreement came into force on 1 January 1956.
Nasser assumed Political power as president in June 1956 . British forces completed their withdrawal from the occupied Suez Canal Zone on 13 June 1956 . He nationalised the Suez Canal on 26 July 1956 ; his hostile approach towards Israel and economic nationalism prompted the beginning of the Second Arab-Israeli War ( Suez Crisis ) , in which Israel ( with support from France and the United Kingdom ) occupied the Sinai peninsula and the Canal . The war came to an end because of US and USSR diplomatic intervention and the status quo was restored .
=== United Arab Republic ( 19581971 ) ===
In 1958 , Egypt and Syria formed a sovereign union known as the United Arab Republic . The union was short-lived , ending in 1961 when Syria seceded , thus ending the union . During most of its existence , the United Arab Republic was also in a loose confederation with Mutawakkilite Kingdom of Yemen ( or the Mutawakkilite Kingdom of Yemen ) , known as the United Arab States . In 1959 , the All-Palestine Government of the Gaza Strip , an Egyptian client state , was absorbed into the United Arab Republic under the pretext of Arab union , and was never restored . The Arab Socialist Union ( Egypt ) , a new nasserist state-party was founded in 1962.
In the early 1960s , Egypt became fully involved in the North Yemen Civil War . The Egyptian President , Gamal Abdel Nasser , supported the Yemeni republicans with as many as 70,000 Egyptian troops and chemical weapons . Despite several military moves and peace conferences , the war sank into a stalemate . Egyptian commitment in Yemen was greatly undermined later .
In mid May 1967 , the Soviet Union issued warnings to Gamal Abdel Nasser of an impending Israeli attack on Syria . Although the chief of staff Mohamed Fawzi ( general ) verified them as `` baseless '' , Nasser took three successive steps that made the war virtually inevitable : on 14 May he deployed his troops in Sinai near the border with Israel , on 19 May he expelled the UN peacekeepers stationed in the Sinai Peninsula border with Israel , and on 23 May he closed the Straits of Tiran to Israeli shipping . On 26 May Gamal Abdel Nasser declared , `` The battle will be a general one and our basic objective will be to destroy Israel '' .
Israel re-iterated that the Straits of Tiran closure was a Casus belli . This prompted the beginning of the Third Arab-Israeli War ( Six-Day War ) in which Israel attacked Egypt , and occupied Sinai Peninsula and the Gaza Strip , which Egypt had Occupation of the Gaza Strip by Egypt since the 1948 ArabIsraeli War . During the 1967 war , an Emergency law in Egypt was enacted , and remained in effect until 2012 , with the exception of an 18-month break in 1980/81 . Under this law , police powers were extended , constitutional rights suspended and censorship legalised .
At the time of the fall of the Egyptian monarchy in the early 1950s , less than half a million Egyptians were considered upper class and rich , four million middle class and 17 million lower class and poor . Fewer than half of all primary-school-age children attended school , most of them being boys . Nasser 's policies changed this . Land reform and distribution , the dramatic growth in university education , and government support to national industries greatly improved social mobility and flattened the social curve . From academic year 195354 through 196566 , overall public school enrolments more than doubled . Millions of previously poor Egyptians , through education and jobs in the public sector , joined the middle class . Doctors , engineers , teachers , lawyers , journalists , constituted the bulk of the swelling middle class in Egypt under Nasser . During the 1960s , the Egyptian economy went from sluggish to the verge of collapse , the society became less free , and Nasser 's appeal waned considerably .
=== Arab Republic of Egypt ( 1971present ) ===
==== President Sadat ( 19701981 ) ====
In 1970 , President Nasser died of a heart attack and was succeeded by Anwar Sadat . Sadat switched Egypt 's Cold War allegiance from the Soviet Union to the United States , expelling Soviet advisors in 1972 . He launched the Infitah economic reform policy , while clamping down on religious and secular opposition . In 1973 , Egypt , along with Syria , launched the Fourth Arab-Israeli War ( Yom Kippur War ) , a surprise attack to regain part of the Sinai territory Israel had captured 6 years earlier . It presented Sadat with a victory that allowed him to regain the Sinai later in return for peace with Israel .
In 1975 , Sadat shifted Nasser 's economic policies and sought to use his popularity to reduce government regulations and encourage foreign investment through his program of Infitah . Through this policy , incentives such as reduced taxes and import tariffs attracted some investors , but investments were mainly directed at low risk and profitable ventures like tourism and construction , abandoning Egypt 's infant industries . Even though Sadat 's policy was intended to modernise Egypt and assist the middle class , it mainly benefited the higher class , and , because of the elimination of subsidies on basic foodstuffs , led to the 1977 Egyptian Bread Riots .
In 1977 , Sadat dissolved the Arab Socialist Union and replaced it with the National Democratic Party ( Egypt ) .
Sadat made a historic visit to Israel in 1977 , which led to the 1979 EgyptIsrael Peace Treaty in exchange for Israeli withdrawal from Sinai . Sadat 's initiative sparked enormous controversy in the Arab world and led to Egypt 's expulsion from the Arab League , but it was supported by most Egyptians . Assassination of Anwar Sadat by an Islamic extremist in October 1981.
==== President Mubarak ( 19812011 ) ====
Hosni Mubarak came to power after the assassination of Sadat in a referendum in which he was the only candidate .
Hosni Mubarak reaffirmed Egypt 's relationship with Israel yet eased the tensions with Egypt 's Arab neighbours . Domestically , Mubarak faced serious problems . Even though farm and industry output expanded , the economy could not keep pace with the population boom . Mass poverty and unemployment led rural families to stream into cities like Cairo where they ended up in crowded slums , barely managing to survive .
On 1986 Egyptian conscripts riot Security Police started rioting , protesting against reports that their term of duty was to be extended from 3 to 4 years . Hotels , nightclubs , restaurants and casinos were attacked in Cairo and there were riots in other cities . A day time curfew was imposed . It took the army 3 days to restore order . 107 people were killed .
In the 1980s , 1990s , and 2000s , terrorist attacks in Egypt became numerous and severe , and began to target Christian Copts , foreign tourists and government officials . In the 1990s an Islamist group , Al-Gama ' a al-Islamiyya , engaged in an extended campaign of violence , from the murders and attempted murders of prominent writers and intellectuals , to the repeated targeting of tourists and foreigners . Serious damage was done to the largest sector of Egypt 's economytourismand in turn to the government , but it also devastated the livelihoods of many of the people on whom the group depended for support .
During Mubarak 's reign , the political scene was dominated by the National Democratic Party ( Egypt ) , which was created by Sadat in 1978 . It passed the 1993 Syndicates Law , 1995 Press Law , and 1999 Nongovernmental Associations Law which hampered freedoms of association and expression by imposing new regulations and draconian penalties on violations . As a result , by the late 1990s parliamentary politics had become virtually irrelevant and alternative avenues for political expression were curtailed as well .
On 17 November 1997 , Luxor massacre 62 people , mostly tourists , were massacred near Luxor .
In late February 2005 , Mubarak announced a reform of the presidential election law , paving the way for multi-candidate polls for the first time since the Free Officers Movement ( Egypt ) . However , the new law placed restrictions on the candidates , and led to Mubarak 's easy re-election victory . Voter turnout was less than 25 % . Election observers also alleged government interference in the election process . After the election , Mubarak imprisoned Ayman Nour , the runner-up .
Human Rights Watch 's 2006 report on Egypt detailed serious human rights violations , including routine torture , arbitrary detentions and trials before military and state security courts . In 2007 , Amnesty International released a report alleging that Egypt had become an international centre for torture , where other nations send suspects for interrogation , often as part of the War on Terror . Egypt 's foreign ministry quickly issued a rebuttal to this report .
Constitutional changes voted on 19 March 2007 prohibited parties from using religion as a basis for political activity , allowed the drafting of a new anti-terrorism law , authorised broad police powers of arrest and surveillance , and gave the president power to dissolve parliament and end judicial election monitoring . In 2009 , Dr. Ali El Deen Hilal Dessouki , Media Secretary of the National Democratic Party ( National Democratic Party ( Egypt ) ) , described Egypt as a `` pharaonic '' political system , and democracy as a `` long-term goal '' . Dessouki also stated that `` the real center of power in Egypt is the military '' .
==== Revolution ( 2011 ) ====
On 25 January 2011 , Egyptian revolution of 2011 began against Mubarak 's government . On 11 February 2011 , Mubarak resigned and fled Cairo . Jubilant celebrations broke out in Cairo 's Tahrir Square at the news . The Egyptian military then assumed the power to govern . Mohamed Hussein Tantawi , chairman of the Supreme Council of the Armed Forces , became the de facto interim [ of state ] . On 13 February 2011 , the military dissolved the parliament and suspended the constitution .
A Egyptian constitutional referendum , 2011 was held on 19 March 2011 . On 28 November 2011 , Egypt held its 201112 Egyptian parliamentary election since the previous regime had been in power . Turnout was high and there were no reports of major irregularities or violence .
==== President Morsi ( 20122013 ) ====
Mohamed Morsi was Egyptian presidential election , 2012 on 24 June 2012 . On 2 August 2012 , Egypt 's Prime Minister Hisham Qandil announced his 35-member cabinet comprising 28 newcomers , including four from the Muslim Brotherhood .
Liberal and secular groups walked out of the Constituent Assembly of Egypt because they believed that it would impose strict Islamic practices , while Muslim Brotherhood backers threw their support behind Morsi . On 22 November 2012 , President Morsi issued a temporary declaration immunising his decrees from challenge and seeking to protect the work of the constituent assembly .
The move led to massive protests and violent action throughout Egypt . On 5 December 2012 , tens of thousands of supporters and opponents of President Morsi clashed , in what was described as the largest violent battle between Islamists and their foes since the country 's revolution . Mohamed Morsi offered a `` national dialogue '' with opposition leaders but refused to cancel the Egyptian constitutional referendum , 2012.
==== Political crisis ( 2013 ) ====
On 3 July 2013 , June 2013 Egyptian protests with autocratic excesses of Morsi 's Muslim Brotherhood government , the military 2013 Egyptian coup d'tat Morsi from office , dissolved the Shura Council and installed a temporary interim government .
On 4 July 2013 , 68-year-old Chief Justice of the Supreme Constitutional Court of Egypt Adly Mansour was sworn in as acting president over the new government following the removal of Morsi . The new Egyptian authorities cracked down on the Muslim Brotherhood and its supporters , jailing thousands and forcefully dispersing pro-Morsi and/or pro-Brotherhood protests . Many of the Muslim Brotherhood leaders and activists have either been sentenced to death or life imprisonment in a series of mass trials .
On 18 January 2014 , the interim government instituted a Egyptian Constitution of 2014 following a referendum approved by an overwhelming majority of voters ( 98.1 % ) . 38.6 % of registered voters participated in the referendum a higher number than the 33 % who voted in a referendum during Morsi 's tenure .
==== President el-Sisi ( 2014present ) ====
On 26 March 2014 , Field Marshal Abdel Fattah el-Sisi , Egyptian Defence Minister and Commander-in-Chief Egyptian Armed Forces , retired from the military , announcing he would stand as a candidate in the Egyptian presidential election , 2014 . The poll , held between 26 and 28 May 2014 , resulted in a landslide victory for el-Sisi . Sisi was sworn into office as President of Egypt on 8 June 2014 . The Muslim Brotherhood and some liberal and secular activist groups boycotted the vote . Even though the interim authorities extended voting to a third day , the 46 % turnout was lower than the 52 % turnout in the 2012 election .
A new parliamentary election was held in December 2015 , resulting in a landslide victory for pro-Sisi parties , which secured a strong majority in the newly formed House of Representatives ( Egypt ) .
In 2016 , Egypt entered in a diplomatic crisis with Italy following the Murder of Giulio Regeni : in April 2016 , Prime Minister Matteo Renzi recalled the Italian ambassador from Cairo because of lack of co-operation from the Egyptian Government in the investigation . The ambassador was sent back to Egypt in 2017 by the new Prime Minister Paolo Gentiloni .
El-Sisi was 2018 Egyptian presidential election re-elected in 2018 , facing no serious opposition . In 2019 , a series of constitutional amendments were approved by the parliament , further increasing the President 's and the military 's power , increasing presidential terms from 4 years to 6 years and allowing El-Sisi to run for other two mandates . The proposals 2019 Egyptian constitutional referendum .
The dispute between Egypt and Ethiopia over the Grand Ethiopian Renaissance Dam escalated in 2020 . Egypt sees the dam as an existential threat , fearing that the dam will reduce the amount of water it receives from the Nile .
== Geography ==
Egypt lies primarily between latitudes 22nd parallel north 22 and 32nd parallel north 32N , and longitudes 25th meridian east 25 and 35th meridian east 35E . At , it is the world 's 30th-largest country . Due to the extreme aridity of Egypt 's climate , population centres are concentrated along the narrow Nile Valley and Delta , meaning that about 99 % of the population uses about 5.5 % of the total land area . 98 % of Egyptians live on 3 % of the territory .
Egypt is bordered by Libya to the west , the Sudan to the south , and the Gaza Strip and Israel to the east . Egypt 's important role in geopolitics stems from its strategic position : a transcontinental nation , it possesses a land bridge ( the Isthmus of Suez ) between Africa and Asia , traversed by a navigable waterway ( the Suez Canal ) that connects the Mediterranean Sea with the Indian Ocean by way of the Red Sea .
Apart from the Nile Valley , the majority of Egypt 's landscape is desert , with a few oasis scattered about . Winds create prolific Dune that peak at more than high . Egypt includes parts of the Sahara desert and of the Libyan Desert . These deserts protected the Kingdom of the Pharaohs from western threats and were referred to as the `` red land '' in ancient Egypt .
Towns and cities include Alexandria , the second largest city ; Aswan ; Asyut ; Cairo , the modern Egyptian capital and largest city ; El Mahalla El Kubra ; Giza , the site of the Pyramid of Khufu ; Hurghada ; Luxor ; Kom Ombo ; Port Safaga ; Port Said ; Sharm El Sheikh ; Suez , where the south end of the Suez Canal is located ; Zagazig ; and Minya , Egypt . Oasis include Bahariya Oasis , Dakhla Oasis , Farafra , Egypt , Kharga Oasis and Siwa Oasis . Protectorates include Ras Mohamed National Park , Zaranik Protectorate and Siwa .
On 13 March 2015 , plans for a proposed new capital of Egypt were announced .
=== Climate ===
Most of Egypt 's rain falls in the winter months . South of Cairo , rainfall averages only around per year and at intervals of many years . On a very thin strip of the northern coast the rainfall can be as high as , mostly between October and March . Snow falls on Sinai 's mountains and some of the north coastal cities such as Damietta , Baltim and Sidi Barrani , and rarely in Alexandria . A very small amount of snow fell on Cairo on 13 December 2013 , the first time in many decades . Frost is also known in mid-Sinai and mid-Egypt . Egypt is the driest and the sunniest country in the world , and most of its land surface is desert .
Egypt has an unusually hot , sunny and dry climate . Average high temperatures are high in the north but very to extremely high in the rest of the country during summer . The cooler Mediterranean winds consistently blow over the northern sea coast , which helps to get more moderated temperatures , especially at the height of the summertime . The Khamaseen is a hot , dry wind that originates from the vast deserts in the south and blows in the spring or in the early summer . It brings scorching sand and dust particles , and usually brings daytime temperatures over and sometimes over in the interior , while the relative humidity can drop to 5 % or even less . The absolute highest temperatures in Egypt occur when the Khamaseen blows . The weather is always sunny and clear in Egypt , especially in cities such as Aswan , Luxor and Asyut . It is one of the least cloudy and least rainy regions on Earth .
Prior to the construction of the Aswan Dam , the Nile flooded annually ( colloquially The Gift of the Nile ) replenishing Egypt 's soil . This gave Egypt a consistent harvest throughout the years .
The potential rise in sea levels due to global warming could threaten Egypt 's densely populated coastal strip and have grave consequences for the country 's economy , agriculture and industry . Combined with growing demographic pressures , a significant rise in sea levels could turn millions of Egyptians into environmental refugees by the end of the 21st century , according to some climate experts .
=== Biodiversity ===
Egypt signed the Rio Convention on Biological Diversity on 9 June 1992 , and became a party to the convention on 2 June 1994 . It has subsequently produced a Biodiversity Action Plan , which was received by the convention on 31 July 1998 . Where many Center for Biological Diversity Biodiversity Action Plan neglect biological kingdoms apart from animals and plants , Egypt 's plan was unusual in providing balanced information about all forms of life .
The plan stated that the following numbers of species of different groups had been recorded from Egypt : algae ( 1483 species ) , animals ( about 15,000 species of which more than 10,000 were insects ) , fungi ( more than 627 species ) , monera ( 319 species ) , plants ( 2426 species ) , protozoans ( 371 species ) . For some major groups , for example lichen-forming fungi and nematode worms , the number was not known . Apart from small and well-studied groups like amphibians , birds , fish , mammals and reptiles , the many of those numbers are likely to increase as further species are recorded from Egypt . For the fungi , including lichen-forming species , for example , subsequent work has shown that over 2200 species have been recorded from Egypt , and the final figure of all fungi actually occurring in the country is expected to be much higher . For the grasses , 284 native and naturalised species have been identified and recorded in Egypt .
== Government ==
The House of Representatives ( Egypt ) , whose members are elected to serve five-year terms , specialises in legislation . Elections in Egypt were last held between 201112 Egyptian parliamentary election which was later dissolved . Egyptian parliamentary election , 2015 was announced to be held within 6 months of the constitution 's ratification on 18 January 2014 , and were held in two phases , from 17 October to 2 December 2015 . Originally , the parliament was to be formed before the president was elected , but interim president Adly Mansour pushed the date . The Egyptian presidential election , 2014 , took place on 2628 May 2014 . Official figures showed a turnout of 25,578,233 or 47.5 % , with Abdel Fattah el-Sisi winning with 23.78 million votes , or 96.9 % compared to 757,511 ( 3.1 % ) for Hamdeen Sabahi .
After a wave of public discontent with autocratic excesses of the Muslim Brotherhood government of President Mohamed Morsi , on 3 July 2013 then-Egyptian Army ranks Abdel Fattah el-Sisi announced the removal of Morsi from office and the suspension of the Egyptian Constitution of 2012 . A 50-member constitution committee was formed for modifying Egyptian Constitution of 2014 which was later published for Egyptian constitutional referendum , 2014 and was adopted on 18 January 2014.
In 2013 , Freedom House rated political rights in Egypt at 5 ( with 1 representing the most free and 7 the least ) , and civil liberties at 5 , which gave it the freedom rating of `` Partly Free '' .
Egyptian nationalism predates its Arab counterpart by many decades , having roots in the 19th century and becoming the dominant mode of expression of Egyptian anti-colonial activists and intellectuals until the early 20th century . The ideology espoused by Islamism such as the Muslim Brotherhood is mostly supported by the lower-middle strata of Egyptian society .
Egypt has the oldest continuous parliamentary tradition in the Arab world . The first popular assembly was established in 1866 . It was disbanded as a result of the British occupation of 1882 , and the British allowed only a consultative body to sit . In 1923 , however , after the country 's independence was declared , a new constitution provided for a parliamentary monarchy .
=== Military and foreign relations ===
The military is influential in the political and economic life of Egypt and exempts itself from laws that apply to other sectors . It enjoys considerable power , prestige and independence within the state and has been widely considered part of the Egyptian `` State within a state '' .
According to the former chair of Israel 's Knesset Foreign Affairs and Defense Committee , Yuval Steinitz , the Egyptian Air Force has roughly the same number of modern warplanes as the Israeli Air Force and far more Western tanks , artillery , anti-aircraft batteries and warships than the Israel Defense Forces . Egypt is speculated by Israel to be the second country in the region with a spy satellite , EgyptSat 1 in addition to EgyptSat 2 launched on 16 April 2014.
The EgyptUnited States relations provides Egypt with annual United States Foreign Military Financing , which in 2015 amounted to US $ 1.3 billion . In 1989 , Egypt was designated as a major non-NATO ally of the United States . Nevertheless , ties between the two countries have partially soured since the 2013 Egyptian coup d'tat of Islamist president Mohamed Morsi , with the Obama administration denouncing Egypt over its crackdown on the Muslim Brotherhood , and cancelling future military exercises involving the two countries . There have been recent attempts , however , to normalise relations between the two , with both governments frequently calling for mutual support in the War on Terror . However , following 2016 United States presidential election of Republican Party ( United States ) Donald Trump as the President of the United States , the two countries were looking to improve the Egypt-United States relations Egyptian-American relations . al-Sisi and Trump had met during the opening of the seventy-first session of the United Nations General Assembly in September 2016 . The absence of Egypt in President Trump 's Executive Order 13769 towards seven Muslim countries was noted in Washington although the Congress has voiced human rights concerns over the handling of dissidents . On 3 April 2017 al-Sisi met with Trump at the White House , marking the first visit of an Egyptian president to Washington in 8 years . Trump praised al-Sisi in what was reported as a public relations victory for the Egyptian president , and signaled it was time for a normalization of the relations between Egypt and the US .
The Egyptian military has dozens of factories manufacturing weapons as well as consumer goods . The Armed Forces ' inventory includes equipment from different countries around the world . Equipment from the former Soviet Union is being progressively replaced by more modern US , French , and British equipment , a significant portion of which is built under license in Egypt , such as the M1 Abrams tank . Relations with EgyptRussia relations have improved significantly following Mohamed Morsi 's removal and both countries have worked since then to strengthen military and trade ties among other aspects of bilateral co-operation . ChinaEgypt relations have also improved considerably . In 2014 , Egypt and China established a bilateral `` comprehensive strategic partnership '' . In July 2019 , UN ambassadors of 37 countries , including Egypt , have signed a joint letter to the UNHRC defending China 's Xinjiang re-education camps in the Xinjiang region .
The permanent [ of the Arab League headquarters ] of the Arab League are located in Cairo and the body 's secretary general has traditionally been Egyptian . This position is currently held by former foreign minister Ahmed Aboul Gheit . The Arab League briefly moved from Egypt to Tunis in 1978 to protest the EgyptIsrael Peace Treaty , but it later returned to Cairo in 1989 . Gulf monarchies , including the EgyptUnited Arab Emirates relations and EgyptSaudi Arabia relations , have pledged billions of dollars to help Egypt overcome its economic difficulties since the overthrow of Morsi .
Following the Yom Kippur War and the subsequent peace treaty , Egypt became the first Arab nation to establish EgyptIsrael relations with Israel . Despite that , Israel is still widely considered as a hostile state by the majority of Egyptians . Egypt has played a historical role as a mediator in resolving various disputes in the Middle East , most notably its handling of the IsraeliPalestinian conflict and the IsraeliPalestinian peace process . Egypt 's ceasefire and truce brokering efforts in GazaIsrael conflict have hardly been challenged following Israel 's evacuation of its settlements from the strip in 2005 , despite increasing animosity towards the Hamas government in Gaza following the ouster of Mohamed Morsi , and despite recent attempts by countries like Turkey and Qatar to take over this role .
Ties between Egypt and other non-Arab Middle Eastern nations , including EgyptIran relations and EgyptTurkey relations , have often been strained . Tensions with Iran are mostly due to Egypt 's peace treaty with Israel and Iran 's rivalry with traditional Egyptian allies in the Gulf . Turkey 's recent support for the now-banned Muslim Brotherhood in Egypt and its alleged involvement in Libyan Civil War ( 2014present ) also made both countries bitter regional rivals .
Egypt is a founding member of the Non-Aligned Movement and the United Nations . It is also a member of the Organisation internationale de la francophonie , since 1983 . Former Egyptian Deputy Prime Minister Boutros Boutros-Ghali served as Secretary-General of the United Nations from 1991 to 1996.
In 2008 , Egypt was estimated to have two million African refugees , including over 20,000 Sudanese nationals registered with UNHCR as refugees fleeing armed conflict or asylum seekers . Egypt adopted `` harsh , sometimes lethal '' methods of border control .
=== Law ===
The legal system is based on Sharia law and civil law ( particularly Napoleonic codes ) ; and judicial review by a Supreme Court , which accepts compulsory International Court of Justice jurisdiction only with reservations .
Islamic jurisprudence is the principal source of legislation . Sharia courts and qadis are run and licensed by the Ministry of Justice ( Egypt ) . The personal status law that regulates matters such as marriage , divorce and child custody is governed by Sharia . In a family court , a woman 's testimony is worth half of a man 's testimony .
On 26 December 2012 , the Muslim Brotherhood attempted to institutionalise a controversial new constitution . It was approved by the public in a Egyptian constitutional referendum , 2012 held 1522 December 2012 with 64 % support , but with only 33 % electorate participation . It replaced the 2011 Provisional Constitution of Egypt , adopted following the revolution .
The Penal code was unique as it contains a `` Blasphemy law in Egypt . '' The present court system allows a death penalty including against an absent individual tried in absentia . Several Americans and Canadians were sentenced to death in 2012.
On 18 January 2014 , the interim government successfully institutionalised a more Egyptian Constitution of 2014 . The president is elected to a four-year term and may serve 2 terms . The parliament may impeach the president . Under the constitution , there is a guarantee of gender equality and absolute Freedom of Religion . The military retains the ability to appoint the national Minister of Defence for the next two full presidential terms since the constitution took effect . Under the constitution , political parties may not be based on `` religion , race , gender or geography '' .
==== Human rights ====
The Egyptian Organization for Human Rights is one of the longest-standing bodies for the defence of [ rights in Egypt ] . In 2003 , the government established the National Council for Human Rights . Shortly after its foundation , the council came under heavy criticism by local activists , who contend it was a propaganda tool for the government to excuse its own violations and to give legitimacy to repressive laws such as the Emergency Law .
The Pew Forum on Religion & Public Life ranks Egypt as the fifth worst country in the world for religious freedom . The United States Commission on International Religious Freedom , a bipartisan independent agency of the US government , has placed Egypt on its watch list of countries that require close monitoring due to the nature and extent of violations of religious freedom engaged in or tolerated by the government . According to a 2010 Pew Research Center Global Attitudes survey , 84 % of Egyptians polled supported the Capital punishment for those who Apostasy in Islam ; 77 % supported whippings and cutting off of hands for theft and robbery ; and 82 % support stoning a person who commits adultery .
Coptic Christians face discrimination at multiple levels of the government , ranging from underrepresentation in government ministries to laws that limit their ability to build or repair churches . Intolerance towards followers of the Bah Faith , and those of the non-orthodox Muslim sects , such as Sufism , Shia Islam Shi ' a and Ahmadiyya , also remains a problem . When the government moved to computerise identification cards , members of religious minorities , such as Bahs , could not obtain Egyptian identification card controversy . An Egyptian court ruled in early 2008 that members of other faiths may obtain identity cards without listing their faiths , and without becoming officially recognised .
Clashes continued between police and supporters of former President Mohamed Morsi . During violent clashes that ensued as part of the August 2013 Egyptian raids August 2013 sit-in dispersal , 595 protesters were killed with 14 August 2013 becoming the single deadliest day in Egypt 's modern history .
Egypt actively practices capital punishment . Egypt 's authorities do not release figures on death sentences and executions , despite repeated requests over the years by human rights organisations . The United Nations human rights office and various NGOs expressed `` deep alarm '' after an Egyptian Minya Criminal Court sentenced 529 people to death in a single hearing on 25 March 2014 . Sentenced supporters of former President Mohamed Morsi were to be executed for their alleged role in violence following his 2013 Egyptian coup d'tat in July 2013 . The judgement was condemned as a violation of international law . By May 2014 , approximately 16,000 people ( and as high as more than 40,000 by one independent count , according to The Economist ) , mostly Brotherhood members or supporters , have been imprisoned after Morsi 's removal after the Muslim Brotherhood was labelled as terrorist organisation by the post-Morsi interim Egyptian government . According to human rights groups there are some 60,000 political prisoners in Egypt .
After Morsi was ousted by the military , the judiciary system aligned itself with the new government , actively supporting the repression of Muslim Brotherhood members . This resulted in a sharp increase in mass death sentences that arose criticism from then-U.S. President Barack Obama and the General Secretary of the UN , Ban Ki Moon .
LGBT rights in Egypt is illegal in Egypt . According to a 2013 survey by the Pew Research Center , 95 % of Egyptians believe that [ should not be accepted by society .
In 2017 , Cairo was voted the most dangerous megacity for women with more than 10 million inhabitants in a poll by Thomson Reuters Foundation . Sexual harassment was described as occurring on a daily basis .
==== Freedom of the press ====
Reporters Without Borders ranked Egypt in their 2017 Press Freedom Index at 160 out of 180 nations . At least 18 journalists were imprisoned in Egypt , . A new anti-terror law was enacted in August 2015 that threatens members of the media with fines ranging from about US $ 25,000 to $ 60,000 for the distribution of wrong information on acts of terror inside the country `` that differ from official declarations of the Egyptian Department of Defense '' .
Some critics of the government have been Misinformation related to the COVID-19 pandemic # Efforts to combat misinformation for allegedly spreading false information about the COVID-19 pandemic in Egypt .
=== Administrative divisions ===
Egypt is divided into 27 governorates . The governorates are further divided into regions . The regions contain towns and villages . Each governorate has a capital , sometimes carrying the same name as the governorate .

Egypt 's economy depends mainly on agriculture , media , petroleum imports , natural gas , and tourism ; there are also more than three million Egyptians working abroad , mainly in Libya , Saudi Arabia , the Persian Gulf and Europe . The completion of the Aswan High Dam in 1970 and the resultant Lake Nasser have altered the time-honoured place of the Nile River in the agriculture and ecology of Egypt . A rapidly growing population , limited arable land , and dependence on the Nile all continue to overtax resources and stress the economy .
The government has invested in communications and physical infrastructure . Egypt has received United States foreign aid since 1979 ( an average of $ 2.2 billion per year ) and is the third-largest recipient of such funds from the United States following the Iraq war . Egypt 's economy mainly relies on these sources of income : tourism , remittances from Egyptians working abroad and revenues from the Suez Canal .
Egypt has a developed energy market based on coal , oil , natural gas , and Hydropower . Substantial coal deposits in the northeast Sinai are mined at the rate of about per year . Oil and gas are produced in the western desert regions , the Gulf of Suez , and the Nile Delta . Egypt has huge reserves of gas , estimated at , and Liquefied natural gas up to 2012 exported to many countries . In 2013 , the Egyptian General Petroleum Co ( EGPC ) said the country will cut exports of natural gas and tell major industries to slow output this summer to avoid an energy crisis and stave off political unrest , Reuters has reported . Egypt is counting on top liquid natural gas ( LNG ) exporter Qatar to obtain additional gas volumes in summer , while encouraging factories to plan their annual maintenance for those months of peak demand , said EGPC chairman , Tarek El Barkatawy . Egypt produces its own energy , but has been a net oil importer since 2008 and is rapidly becoming a net importer of natural gas .
Economic conditions have started to improve considerably , after a period of stagnation , due to the adoption of more liberal economic policies by the government as well as increased revenues from tourism and a booming stock market . In its annual report , the International Monetary Fund ( IMF ) has rated Egypt as one of the top countries in the world undertaking economic reforms . Some major economic reforms undertaken by the government since 2003 include a dramatic slashing of customs and tariffs . A new Tax law implemented in 2005 decreased corporate taxes from 40 % to the current 20 % , resulting in a stated 100 % increase in tax revenue by the year 2006.
Foreign direct investment ( FDI ) in Egypt increased considerably before the removal of Hosni Mubarak , exceeding $ 6 billion in 2006 , due to Liberal theory of economics and privatisation measures taken by minister of investment Mahmoud Mohieddin . Since the fall of Hosni Mubarak in 2011 , Egypt has experienced a drastic fall in both foreign investment and tourism revenues , followed by a 60 % drop in foreign exchange reserves , a 3 % drop in growth , and a rapid devaluation of the Egyptian pound .
Although one of the main obstacles still facing the Egyptian economy is the limited trickle down of wealth to the average population , many Egyptians criticise their government for higher prices of basic goods while their Standard of living or purchasing power remains relatively stagnant . Corruption is often cited by Egyptians as the main impediment to further economic growth . The government promised major reconstruction of the country 's infrastructure , using money paid for the newly acquired third mobile license ( $ 3 billion ) by Emirates Telecommunications Corporation in 2006 . In the Corruption Perceptions Index 2013 , Egypt was ranked 114 out of 177.
Egypt 's most prominent multinational companies are the Orascom Group and Raya Contact Center . The information technology ( IT ) sector has expanded rapidly in the past few years , with many start-ups selling outsourcing services to North America and Europe , operating with companies such as Microsoft , Oracle and other major corporations , as well as many small and medium size enterprises . Some of these companies are the Xceed Contact Center , Raya , E Group Connections and C3 . The IT sector has been stimulated by new Egyptian entrepreneurs with government encouragement .
An estimated 2.7 million Egyptians abroad contribute actively to the development of their country through remittances ( US $ 7.8 billion in 2009 ) , as well as circulation of human and social capital and investment . Remittances , money earned by Egyptians living abroad and sent home , reached a record US $ 21 billion in 2012 , according to the World Bank .
Egyptian society is moderately unequal in terms of income distribution , with an estimated 3540 % of Egypt 's population earning less than the equivalent of $ 2 a day , while only around 23 % may be considered wealthy .
=== Tourism ===
Tourism is one of the most important sectors in Egypt 's economy . More than 12.8 million tourists visited Egypt in 2008 , providing revenues of nearly $ 11 billion . The tourism sector employs about 12 % of Egypt 's workforce . Tourism Minister Hisham Zaazou told industry professionals and reporters that tourism generated some $ 9.4 billion in 2012 , a slight increase over the $ 9 billion seen in 2011.
The Giza Necropolis is one of Egypt 's best-known tourist attractions ; it is the only one of the Seven Wonders of the Ancient World still in existence .
Egypt 's beaches on the Mediterranean and the Red Sea , which extend to over , are also popular tourist destinations ; the Gulf of Aqaba beaches , Safaga , Sharm el-Sheikh , Hurghada , Luxor , Dahab , Ras Sidr and Marsa Alam are popular sites .
=== Energy ===
Egypt produced 691,000 ; bbl/d of oil and 2,141.05 ; Tcf of natural gas in 2013 , making the country the largest non-OPEC producer of oil and the second-largest dry natural gas producer in Africa . In 2013 , Egypt was the largest consumer of oil and natural gas in Africa , as more than 20 % of total oil consumption and more than 40 % of total dry natural gas consumption in Africa . Also , Egypt possesses the largest oil refinery capacity in Africa 726,000 ; bbl/d ( in 2012 ) .
Egypt is currently planning to build its first nuclear power plant in El Dabaa , in the northern part of the country , with $ 25 billion in Russian financing .
=== Transport ===
Transport in Egypt is centred around Cairo and largely follows the pattern of settlement along the Nile . The main line of the nation 's railway network runs from Alexandria to Aswan and is operated by Egyptian National Railways . The vehicle road network has expanded rapidly to over , consisting of 28 line , 796 stations , 1800 train covering the Nile Valley and Nile Delta , the Mediterranean and Red Sea coasts , the Sinai , and the Western oases .
The Cairo Metro in Egypt is the first of only two full-fledged metro systems in Africa and the Arab World . It is considered one of the most important recent projects in Egypt which cost around 12 billion Egyptian pounds . The system consists of three operational lines with a fourth line expected in the future .
EgyptAir , which is now the country 's flag carrier and largest airline , was founded in 1932 by Egyptian industrialist Talaat Harb , today owned by the Egyptian government . The airline is based at Cairo International Airport , its main hub , operating scheduled passenger and freight services to more than 75 destinations in the Middle East , Europe , Africa , Asia , and the Americas . The Current EgyptAir fleet includes 80 aeroplanes .
==== Suez Canal ====
The Suez Canal is an artificial sea-level waterway in Egypt considered the most important centre of the maritime transport in the Middle East , connecting the Mediterranean Sea and the Red Sea . Opened in November 1869 after 10 years of construction work , it allows ship transport between Europe and Asia without navigation around Africa . The northern terminus is Port Said and the southern terminus is Port Tawfiq at the city of Suez . Ismailia lies on its west bank , from the half-way point .
The canal is long , deep and wide . It consists of the northern access channel of , the canal itself of and the southern access channel of . The canal is a single lane with passing places in the Ballah By-Pass and the Great Bitter Lake . It contains no locks ; seawater flows freely through the canal . In general , the canal north of the Bitter Lakes flows north in winter and south in summer . The current south of the lakes changes with the tide at Suez .
On 26 August 2014 a proposal was made for opening a New Suez Canal . Work on the New Suez Canal was completed in July 2015 . The channel was officially inaugurated with a ceremony attended by foreign leaders and featuring military flyovers on 6 August 2015 , in accordance with the budgets laid out for the project .
=== Water supply and sanitation ===
The piped water supply in Egypt increased between 1990 and 2010 from 89 % to 100 % in urban areas and from 39 % to 93 % in rural areas despite rapid population growth . Over that period , Egypt achieved the elimination of open defecation in rural areas and invested in infrastructure . Access to an improved water source in Egypt is now practically universal with a rate of 99 % . About one half of the population is connected to sanitary sewers .
Partly because of low sanitation coverage about 17,000 children die each year because of diarrhoea . Another challenge is low cost recovery due to water tariffs that are among the lowest in the world . This in turn requires government subsidies even for operating costs , a situation that has been aggravated by salary increases without tariff increases after the Arab Spring . Poor operation of facilities , such as water and wastewater treatment plants , as well as limited government accountability and transparency , are also issues .
=== Irrigated land and crops ===
Due to the absence of appreciable rainfall , Egypt 's agriculture depends entirely on irrigation . The main source of irrigation water is the river Nile of which the flow is controlled by the high dam at Aswan . It releases , on average , 55 cubic kilometres ( 45,000,000 acreft ) water per year , of which some 46 cubic kilometres ( 37,000,000 acreft ) are diverted into the irrigation canals .
In the Nile valley and delta , almost 33,600 square kilometres ( 13,000 sq mi ) of land benefit from these irrigation waters producing on average 1.8 crops per year .
== Demographics ==
Egypt is the most populated country in the Arab world and the third most populous on the African continent , with about 95 million inhabitants . Its population grew rapidly from 1970 to 2010 due to History of medicine # Modern medicine and increases in agricultural productivity enabled by the Green Revolution . Egypt 's population was estimated at 3 million when Napoleon I of France invaded the country in 1798.
Egypt 's people are highly urbanised , being concentrated along the Nile ( notably Cairo and Alexandria ) , in the Delta and near the Suez Canal . Egyptians are divided demographically into those who live in the major urban centres and the fellahin , or farmers , that reside in rural villages . The total inhabited area constitutes only 77,041 km , putting the physiological density at over 1,200 people per km2 , similar to Bangladesh .
While emigration was restricted under Nasser , thousands of Egyptian professionals were dispatched abroad in the context of the Arab Cold War . Egyptian emigration was liberalised in 1971 , under President Sadat , reaching record numbers after the 1973 oil crisis . An estimated 2.7 million Egyptians live abroad . Approximately 70 % of Egyptian migrants live in Arab countries ( 923,600 in Saudi Arabia , 332,600 in Libya , 226,850 in Jordan , 190,550 in Kuwait with the rest elsewhere in the region ) and the remaining 30 % reside mostly in Europe and North America ( 318,000 in the United States , 110,000 in Canada and 90,000 in Italy ) . The process of emigrating to non-Arab states has been ongoing since the 1950s .
=== Ethnic groups ===
Ethnic Egyptians are by far the largest ethnic group in the country , constituting 99.7 % of the total population . Ethnic minorities include the Abaza people , Turkish people , Greeks , Bedouin Arab tribes living in the eastern deserts and the Sinai Peninsula , the Berber language-speaking Siwis ( Berber people ) of the Siwa Oasis , and the Nubian people communities clustered along the Nile . There are also tribal Beja people communities concentrated in the southeasternmost corner of the country , and a number of Dom people clans mostly in the Nile Delta and Faiyum who are progressively becoming assimilated as urbanisation increases .
Some 5 million immigrants live in Egypt , mostly Sudanese , `` some of whom have lived in Egypt for generations . '' Smaller numbers of immigrants come from Iraq , Ethiopia , Somalia , South Sudan , and Eritrea .
The Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees estimated that the total number of `` people of concern '' ( refugees , asylum seekers , and stateless people ) was about 250,000 . In 2015 , the number of registered Syrian refugees in Egypt was 117,000 , a decrease from the previous year . Egyptian government claims that a half-million Syrian refugees live in Egypt are thought to be exaggerated . There are 28,000 registered Sudanese refugees in Egypt .
The once-vibrant and ancient Greeks in Egypt and History of the Jews in Egypt have almost Jewish exodus from Arab lands , with only a small number remaining in the country , but many Egyptian Jews visit on religious or other occasions and tourism . Several important Jewish archaeological and historical sites are found in Cairo , Alexandria and other cities .
=== Languages ===
The official language of the Republic is Modern Standard Arabic . The spoken languages are : Egyptian Arabic ( 68 % ) , Sa'idi Arabic ( 29 % ) , Bedawi Arabic ( 1.6 % ) , Sudanese Arabic ( 0.6 % ) , Domari language ( 0.3 % ) , Nobiin language ( 0.3 % ) , Beja language ( 0.1 % ) , Siwi language and others . Additionally , Greek language , Armenian language and Italian language , and more recently , African languages like Amharic language and Tigrinya language are the main languages of immigrants .
The main foreign languages taught in schools , by order of popularity , are English language , French language , German language and Italian language .
Historically Egyptian language was spoken , of which the latest stage is Coptic language . Spoken Coptic was mostly extinct by the 17th century but may have survived in isolated pockets in Upper Egypt as late as the 19th century . It remains in use as the liturgical language of the Coptic Orthodox Church of Alexandria . It forms a separate branch among the family of Afroasiatic languages .
=== Religion ===
Egypt has the largest Muslim population in the Arab world , and the Islam by country sixth world 's largest Muslim population , and home for ( 5 % ) of the world 's Muslim population . Egypt also has the Christianity in the Middle East in the Middle East and North Africa .
Egypt is a predominantly Sunni Muslim country with Islam as its state religion . The percentage of adherents of various religions is a controversial topic in Egypt . An estimated 8590 % are identified as Muslim , 1015 % as Coptic Christians , and 1 % as other Christian denominations , although without a census the numbers can not be known . Other estimates put the Christian population as high as 1520 % . Non-denominational Muslims form roughly 12 % of the population .
Egypt was a Christian country before the 7th century , and after Islam arrived , the country was gradually Islamised into a majority-Muslim country . It is not known when Muslims reached a majority variously estimated from c. 1000 CE to as late as the 14th century . Egypt emerged as a centre of politics and culture in the Muslim world . Under Anwar Sadat , Islam became the official state religion and Sharia the main source of law . It is estimated that 15 million Egyptians follow Sufism Tariqah , with the Sufi leadership asserting that the numbers are much greater as many Egyptian Sufis are not officially registered with a Sufi order . At least 305 people were killed during a 2017 Sinai mosque attack on a Sufi mosque in Sinai .
There is also a Shi ' a minority . The Jerusalem Center for Public Affairs estimates the Shia population at 1 to 2.2 million and could measure as much as 3 million . The Ahmadiyya population is estimated at less than 50,000 , whereas the Salafi ( ultra-conservative Sunni ) population is estimated at five to six million . Cairo is famous for its numerous mosque minarets and has been dubbed `` The City of 1,000 Minarets '' .
Of the Christianity in Egypt over 90 % belong to the native Coptic Orthodox Church of Alexandria , an Oriental Orthodox Christian Church . Other native Egyptian Christians are adherents of the Coptic Catholic Church , the Evangelical Church of Egypt ( Synod of the Nile ) and various other Protestantism denominations . Non-native Christian communities are largely found in the urban regions of Cairo and Alexandria , such as the Syro-Lebanese in Egypt Syro-Lebanese , who belong to Melkite Greek Catholic Church , Greek Orthodox , and Maronite Catholic denominations .
Ethnic Greeks also made up a large Greek Orthodox population in the past . Likewise , Armenians made up the then larger Armenian Orthodox and Armenian Catholic communities . Egypt also used to have a large Roman Catholicism in Egypt community , largely made up of Italian Egyptians and Maltese in Egypt . These non-native communities were much larger in Egypt before the Nasser regime and the nationalisation that took place .
Egypt hosts the Coptic Orthodox Church of Alexandria . It was founded back in the first century , considered to be the largest church in the country .
Egypt is also the home of Al-Azhar University ( founded in 969 CE , began teaching in 975 CE ) , which is today the world 's `` most influential voice of establishment Sunni Islam '' and is , by some measures , the second-oldest continuously operating university in world .
Egypt recognises only three religions : Islam , Christianity , and Judaism . Other faiths and minority Muslim sects practised by Egyptians , such as the small Bah Faith and Ahmadiyya communities , are not recognised by the state and face persecution by the government , which labels these groups a threat to Egypt 's national security . Individuals , particularly Bahs and atheists , wishing to include their religion ( or lack thereof ) on their mandatory state issued identification cards are denied this ability ( see Egyptian identification card controversy ) , and are put in the position of either not obtaining required identification or lying about their faith . A 2008 court ruling allowed members of unrecognised faiths to obtain identification and leave the religion field blank .
=== Largest cities ===
== Culture ==
Egypt is a recognised cultural trend-setter of the Arabic-speaking world . Contemporary Arabic and Middle-Eastern culture is heavily influenced by Egyptian literature , music , film and television . Egypt gained a regional leadership role during the 1950s and 1960s , giving a further enduring boost to the standing of Egyptian culture in the Arabic-speaking world .
Egyptian identity evolved in the span of a long period of occupation to accommodate Islam , Christianity and Judaism ; and a new language , Arabic language , and its spoken descendant , Egyptian Arabic which is also based on many Ancient Egyptian words .
The work of early 19th century scholar Rifa ' a al-Tahtawi renewed interest in Ancient Egypt and exposed Egyptian society to Age of Enlightenment principles . Tahtawi co-founded with education reformer Ali Mubarak a native Egyptology school that looked for inspiration to medieval Egyptian scholars , such as Suyuti and Maqrizi , who themselves studied the History of ancient Egypt , Egyptian language and Ancient Egyptian architecture of Egypt .
Egypt 's renaissance peaked in the late 19th and early 20th centuries through the work of people like Muhammad Abduh , Ahmed Lutfi el-Sayed , Muhammad Loutfi Goumah , Tawfiq el-Hakim , Louis Awad , Qasim Amin , Salama Moussa , Taha Hussein and Mahmoud Mokhtar . They forged a liberalism path for Egypt expressed as a commitment to personal freedom , secularism and faith in science to bring progress .
=== Arts ===
The Egyptians were one of the first major civilisations to codify design elements in art and Ancient Egyptian architecture . Egyptian blue , also known as calcium copper silicate is a pigment used by Egyptians for thousands of years . It is considered to be the first synthetic pigment . The wall paintings done in the service of the Pharaohs followed a rigid code of visual rules and meanings . Egyptian civilisation is renowned for its colossal Egyptian pyramids , Egyptian temple and monumental tombs .
Well-known examples are the Pyramid of Djoser designed by ancient architect and engineer Imhotep , the Sphinx , and the temple of Abu Simbel . Modern and contemporary Egyptian art can be as diverse as any works in the world art scene , from the vernacular architecture of Hassan Fathy and Ramses Wissa Wassef , to Mahmoud Mokhtar 's sculptures , to the distinctive Coptic art of Isaac Fanous . The Cairo Opera House serves as the main performing arts venue in the Egyptian capital .
=== Literature ===
Egyptian literature traces its beginnings to ancient Egypt and is some of the earliest known literature . Indeed , the Egyptians were the first culture to develop literature as we know it today , that is , the book . It is an important cultural element in the life of Egypt . Egyptian novelists and poets were among the first to experiment with modern styles of Arabic literature , and the forms they developed have been widely imitated throughout the Arab world . The first modern Egyptian novel Zaynab ( novel ) by Muhammad Husayn Haykal was published in 1913 in the Egyptian Arabic . Egyptian novelist Naguib Mahfouz was the first Arabic-language writer to win the Nobel Prize in Literature . Egyptian women writers include Nawal El Saadawi , well known for her feminism activism , and Alifa Rifaat who also writes about women and tradition .
Vernacular poetry is perhaps the most popular literary genre among Egyptians , represented by the works of Ahmed Fouad Negm ( Fagumi ) , Salah Jaheen and Abdel Rahman el-Abnudi .
=== Media ===
Media of Egypt are highly influential throughout the Arab World , attributed to large audiences and increasing freedom from government control . Freedom of the media is guaranteed in the constitution ; however , many laws still restrict this right .
=== Cinema ===
Egyptian cinema became a regional force with the coming of sound . In 1936 , Studio Misr , financed by industrialist Talaat Pasha Harb , emerged as the leading Egyptian studio , a role the company retained for three decades . For over 100 years , more than 4000 films have been produced in Egypt , three quarters of the total Arab production . Egypt is considered the leading country in the field of cinema in the Arab world . Actors from all over the Arab world seek to appear in the Egyptian cinema for the sake of fame . The Cairo International Film Festival has been rated as one of 11 festivals with a top class rating worldwide by the International Federation of Film Producers ' Associations .
=== Music ===
Music of Egypt is a rich mixture of indigenous , Mediterranean , African and Western elements . It has been an integral part of culture of Egypt since antiquity . The ancient Egyptians credited one of their gods Hathor with the invention of music , which Osiris in turn used as part of his effort to civilise the world . Egyptians used music instruments since then .
Contemporary Egyptian music traces its beginnings to the creative work of people such as Abdu al-Hamuli , Almaz and Mahmoud Osman , who influenced the later work of Sayed Darwish , Umm Kulthum , Mohammed Abdel Wahab and Abdel Halim Hafez whose age is considered the golden age of music in Egypt and the whole Arab world . Prominent contemporary Egyptian pop singers include Amr Diab and Mohamed Mounir .
=== Dances ===
Today , Egypt is often considered the home of belly dance . Egyptian belly dance has two main styles  raqs baladi and raqs sharqi . There are also numerous folkloric and character dances that may be part of an Egyptian-style belly dancer 's repertoire , as well as the modern shaabi street dance which shares some elements with raqs baladi .
=== Museums ===
Egypt has one of the oldest civilisations in the world . It has been in contact with many other civilisations and nations and has been through so many eras , starting from prehistoric age to the modern age , passing through so many ages such as ; Pharonic , Roman , Greek , Islamic and many other ages . Because of this wide variation of ages , the continuous contact with other nations and List of conflicts in Egypt Egypt had been through , at least 60 museums may be found in Egypt , mainly covering a wide area of these ages and conflicts .

=== Cuisine ===
Egyptian cuisine is notably conducive to vegetarian diets , as it relies heavily on legume and vegetable dishes . Although food in Alexandria and the coast of Egypt tends to use a great deal of fish and other seafood , for the most part Egyptian cuisine is based on foods that grow out of the ground . Meat has been very expensive for most Egyptians throughout history , so a great number of vegetarian dishes have been developed .
Some consider kushari ( a mixture of rice , lentils , and macaroni ) to be the national dish . Fried onions can be also added to kushari . In addition , ful medames ( mashed fava beans ) is one of the most popular dishes . Fava bean is also used in making falafel ( also known as `` ta  miya '' ) , which may have originated in Egypt and spread to other parts of the Middle East .

== Education ==
The illiteracy rate has decreased since 1996 from 39.4 to 25.9 percent in 2013 . The adult literacy rate was estimated at 73.9 % . The illiteracy rate is highest among those over 60 years of age being estimated at around 64.9 % , while illiteracy among youth between 15 and 24 years of age was listed at 8.6 percent .
A European-style education system was first introduced in Egypt by the Ottomans in the early 19th century to nurture a class of loyal bureaucrats and army officers . Under British occupation investment in education was curbed drastically , and secular public schools , which had previously been free , began to charge fees .
In the 1950s , President Nasser phased in free education for all Egyptians . The Egyptian curriculum influenced other Arab education systems , which often employed Egyptian-trained teachers . Demand soon outstripped the level of available state resources , causing the quality of public education to deteriorate . Today this trend has culminated in poor teacherstudent ratios ( often around one to fifty ) and persistent gender inequality .
Basic education , which includes six years of primary and three years of preparatory school , is a right for Egyptian children from the age of six . After grade 9 , students are tracked into one of two strands of secondary education : general or technical schools . General secondary education prepares students for further education , and graduates of this track normally join higher education institutes based on the results of the Thanaweya Amma , the leaving exam .
Technical secondary education has two strands , one lasting three years and a more advanced education lasting five . Graduates of these schools may have access to higher education based on their results on the final exam , but this is generally uncommon .
Cairo University is ranked as 401500 according to the Academic Ranking of World Universities ( Shanghai Ranking ) and 551600 according to QS World University Rankings . American University in Cairo is ranked as 360 according to QS World University Rankings and Al-Azhar University , Alexandria University and Ain Shams University fall in the 701+ range .
Egypt is currently opening new research institutes for the aim of modernising research in the nation , the most recent example of which is Zewail City of Science and Technology .
== Health ==
Egyptian life expectancy at birth was 73.20 years in 2011 , or 71.30 years for males and 75.20 years for females . Egypt spends 3.7 percent of its gross domestic product on health including treatment costs 22 percent incurred by citizens and the rest by the state . In 2010 , spending on healthcare accounted for 4.66 % of the country 's GDP . In 2009 , there were 16.04 physicians and 33.80 nurses per 10,000 inhabitants .
As a result of modernisation efforts over the years , Egypt 's healthcare system has made great strides forward . Access to healthcare in both urban and rural areas greatly improved and immunisation programs are now able to cover 98 % of the population . Life expectancy increased from 44.8 years during the 1960s to 72.12 years in 2009 . There was a noticeable decline of the infant mortality rate ( during the 1970s to the 1980s the infant mortality rate was 101-132/1000 live births , in 2000 the rate was 50-60/1000 , and in 2008 it was 28-30/1000 ) .
According to the World Health Organization in 2008 , an estimated 91.1 % of Egypt 's girls and women aged 15 to 49 have been subjected to Female genital mutilation , despite being illegal in the country .

Greece is considered the cradle of Western culture , being the birthplace of Athenian democracy , Western philosophy , Western literature , [ political science ] , major [ [ History of science in classical antiquity and Greek mathematics principles , Drama and the Olympic Games . From the eighth century BC , the Greeks were organised into various independent city-states , known as poleis ( singular polis ) , which spanned the Mediterranean Basin and the Black Sea . Philip II of Macedon united most of present-day Greece in the fourth century BC , with his son Alexander the Great rapidly conquering much of the ancient world , from the eastern Mediterranean to India . The subsequent Hellenistic period saw the height of Greek culture and influence in antiquity . Greece was annexed by Roman Republic in the second century BC , becoming an integral part of the Roman Empire and its continuation , the Byzantine Empire , which was predominately culturally and linguistically Greek . The Greek Orthodox Church , which emerged in the first century AD , helped shape modern Greek identity and transmitted Greek traditions to the wider Eastern Orthodox Church .

The corresponding form in Ancient Greek and conservative formal Modern Greek ( Katharevousa ) is  ( Hellas , classical : , modern : ) . This is the source of the English alternate name Hellas , which is mostly found in archaic or poetic contexts today .

The English names Greece and Greek are derived , via the Latin Graecia and Graecus , from the name of the Graecians (  , Graiko ; singular  , Graiks ) , who were among the first List of ancient Greek tribes to settle Magna Graecia in southern Italy . The term is ultimately derived from the Proto-Indo-European language Proto-Indo-European root wikt : Reconstruction : Proto-Indo-European/erh- , `` to grow old '' .
== History ==
=== Prehistory and early history ===
The earliest evidence of the presence of human ancestors in the southern Balkans , dated to 270,000BC , is to be found in the Petralona cave , in the Greek province of Macedonia . The Apidima Cave in Mani Peninsula , in southern Greece , contains the oldest remains of Early modern human outside of Africa , dated to 210,000 years ago . All three stages of the Stone Age ( Paleolithic , Mesolithic , and Neolithic ) are represented in Greece , for example in the Franchthi Cave . Neolithic settlements in Greece , dating from the 7th millennium BC , are the oldest in Europe by several centuries , as Greece lies on the route via which farming spread from the Near East to Europe .
Greece is home to the first advanced civilizations in Europe and is considered the birthplace of Western civilisation , beginning with the Cycladic civilization on the islands of the Aegean Sea at around 3200 BC , the Minoan civilization in Crete ( 27001500 BC ) , and then the Mycenaean Greece civilization on the mainland ( 16001100 BC ) . These civilizations possessed writing , the Minoans using an Undeciphered writing systems known as Linear A , and the Mycenaeans writing the earliest Attested language form of Greek language in Linear B . The Mycenaeans gradually absorbed the Minoans , but collapsed violently around 1200 BC , along with other civilizations , during the regional event known as the Late Bronze Age collapse . This ushered in a period known as the Greek Dark Ages , from which written records are absent . Though the unearthed Linear B texts are too fragmentary for the reconstruction of the political landscape and ca n't support the existence of a larger state , contemporary Hittite and Egyptian records suggest the presence of a single state under a `` Great King '' based in mainland Greece .
===Archaic and Classical period===
The end of the Dark Ages is traditionally dated to 776 BC , the year of the first Ancient Olympic Games . The Iliad and the Odyssey , the foundational texts of Western literature , are believed to have been composed by Homer in the 7th or 8th centuries BC . With the end of the Dark Ages , there emerged various kingdoms and city-states across the Greek peninsula , which spread to the shores of the Black Sea , Magna Grecia ( `` Magna Graecia '' ) and Anatolia . These states and their colonies reached great levels of prosperity that resulted in an unprecedented cultural boom , that of classical Greece , expressed in Architecture of ancient Greece , Theatre of ancient Greece , Ancient Greek science , Greek mathematics and Ancient Greek philosophy . In 508 BC , Cleisthenes instituted the world 's first Athenian democracy system of government in Athens .
By 500 BC , the Achaemenid Empire controlled the Greek city states in Asia Minor and Macedonia . Attempts by some of the Greek city-states of Asia Minor to overthrow Persian rule Ionian Revolt , and Persia First Persian invasion of Greece in 492 BC , but was forced to withdraw after a defeat at the Battle of Marathon in 490 BC . In response , the Greek city-states formed the Hellenic League in 481 BC , led by Sparta , which was the first historically recorded union of Greek states since the mythical union of the Trojan War . A second Persian invasion of Greece by the Persians followed in 480 BC . Following decisive Greek victories in 480 and 479 BC at Battle of Salamis , Battle of Plataea , and Battle of Mycale , the Persians were forced to withdraw for a second time , marking their eventual withdrawal from all of their European territories . Led by Athens and Sparta , the Greek victories in the Greco-Persian Wars are considered a pivotal moment in world history , as the 50 years of peace that followed are known as the Fifth-century Athens , the seminal period of ancient Greek development that laid many of the foundations of Western civilization .
Lack of political unity within Greece resulted in frequent conflict between Greek states . The most devastating intra-Greek war was the Peloponnesian War ( 431404 BC ) , won by Sparta and marking the demise of the Athenian Empire as the leading power in ancient Greece . Both Athens and Sparta were later overshadowed by Ancient Thebes ( Boeotia ) and eventually Macedon , with the latter uniting most of the city-states of the Greek hinterland in the League of Corinth ( also known as the Hellenic League or Greek League ) under the control of Phillip II of Macedon . Despite this development , the Greek world remained largely fragmented and would not be united under a single power until the Roman years . Sparta did not join the League and actively fought against it , raising an army led by Agis III to secure the city-states of Crete for Persia .
Following the assassination of Phillip II , his son Alexander III of Macedon ( `` The Great '' ) assumed the leadership of the League of Corinth and launched an invasion of the Persian Empire with the combined forces of the League in 334 BC . Undefeated in battle , Alexander had conquered the Persian Empire in its entirety by 330 BC . By the time of his death in 323 BC , he had created one of the largest empires in history , stretching from Greece to India . Upon his death , his empire split into several kingdoms , the most famous of which were the Seleucid Empire , Ptolemaic Egypt , the Greco-Bactrian Kingdom , and the Indo-Greeks Indo-Greek Kingdom . Many Greeks migrated to Alexandria , Antioch , Seleucia , and the many other new Hellenistic cities in Asia and Africa . Although the political unity of Alexander 's empire could not be maintained , it resulted in the Hellenistic civilization and spread the Greek language and Greek culture in the territories conquered by Alexander . Greek science , technology , and mathematics are generally considered to have reached their peak during the Hellenistic period .
=== Hellenistic and Roman periods ( 323 BC  4th century AD ) ===
After a Wars of the Diadochi following Alexander 's death , the Antigonid dynasty , descended from one of Alexander 's generals , established its control over Macedon and most of the Greek city-states by 276 BC . From about 200 BC the Ancient Rome became increasingly involved in Greek affairs and engaged in a Macedonian Wars . Macedon 's defeat at the Battle of Pydna in 168 BC signalled the end of Antigonid power in Greece . In 146 BC , Macedonia was annexed as a province by Rome , and the rest of Greece became a Roman protectorate .
The process was completed in 27 BC when the Roman Emperor Augustus annexed the rest of Greece and constituted it as the senatorial province of Achaea ( Roman province ) . Despite their military superiority , the Romans admired and became Greco-Roman world by the achievements of Greek culture , hence Horace 's famous statement : Graecia capta ferum victorem cepit ( `` Greece , although captured , took its wild conqueror captive '' ) . The epics of Homer inspired the Aeneid of Virgil , and authors such as Seneca the younger wrote using Greek styles . Roman heroes such as Scipio Africanus , tended to study philosophy and regarded Greek culture and science as an example to be followed . Similarly , most Roman emperors maintained an admiration for things Greek in nature . The Roman Emperor Nero visited Greece in AD 66 , and performed at the Ancient Olympic Games , despite the rules against non-Greek participation . Hadrian was also particularly fond of the Greeks . Before becoming emperor , he served as an eponymous archon of Athens .
Greek-speaking communities of the Hellenised East were instrumental in the spread of early Christianity in the 2nd and 3rd centuries , and Christianity 's early leaders and writers ( notably St Paul St. Paul ) were mostly Greek-speaking , though generally not from Greece itself . The New Testament was written in Greek , and some of its sections ( First Epistle to the Corinthians , First Epistle to the Thessalonians , Epistle to the Philippians , Book of Revelation of St. John of Patmos ) attest to the importance of churches in Greece in early Christianity . Nevertheless , much of Greece clung tenaciously to paganism , and ancient Greek religious practices were still in vogue in the late 4th century AD , when they were outlawed by the Roman emperor Theodosius I in 391392 . The last recorded Olympic games were held in 393 , and many temples were destroyed or damaged in the century that followed . In Athens and rural areas , paganism is attested well into the sixth century AD and even later . The closure of the Neoplatonism Academy of Athens by the Emperor Justinian in 529 is considered by many to mark the end of antiquity , although there is evidence that the Academy continued its activities for some time after that . Some remote areas such as the southeastern Peloponnese remained pagan until well into the 10th century AD .
=== Medieval period ( 4th  15th century ) ===
The Roman Empire in the east , following the Decline of the Roman Empire in the 5th century , is conventionally known as the Byzantine Empire ( but was simply called `` Kingdom of the Romans '' in its own time ) and lasted until 1453 . With its capital in Constantinople , its language and culture were Greek and its religion was predominantly Eastern Orthodox Church .
From the 4th century , the Empire 's Balkan territories , including Greece , suffered from the dislocation of Migration Period . The raids and devastation of the Goths and Huns in the 4th and 5th centuries and the South Slavs invasion of Greece in the 7th century resulted in a dramatic collapse in imperial authority in the Greek peninsula . Following the Slavic invasion , the imperial government retained formal control of only the islands and coastal areas , particularly the densely populated walled cities such as Athens , Corinth and Thessalonica , while some mountainous areas in the interior held out on their own and continued to recognise imperial authority . Outside of these areas , a limited amount of Slavic settlement is generally thought to have occurred , although on a much smaller scale than previously thought . However , the view that Greece in late antiquity underwent a crisis of decline , fragmentation and depopulation is now considered outdated , as Greek cities show a high degree of institutional continuity and prosperity between the 4th and 6th centuries AD ( and possibly later as well ) . In the early 6th century , Greece had approximately 80 cities according to the Synecdemus chronicle , and the period from the 4th to the 7th century AD is considered one of high prosperity not just in Greece but in the entire Eastern Mediterranean .
Until the 8th century almost all of modern Greece was under the jurisdiction of the Holy See of Rome according to the system of Pentarchy . Byzantine Emperor Leo III moved the border of the Patriarchate of Constantinople westward and northward in the 8th century .
The Byzantine recovery of lost provinces began toward the end of the 8th century and most of the Greek peninsula came under imperial control again , in stages , during the 9th century . This process was facilitated by a large influx of Greeks from Sicily and Asia Minor to the Greek peninsula , while at the same time many Slavs were captured and re-settled in Asia Minor and the few that remained were assimilated . During the 11th and 12th centuries the return of stability resulted in the Greek peninsula benefiting from strong economic growth ;  much stronger than that of the Anatolian territories of the Empire . During that time , the Greek Orthodox Church was also instrumental in the spread of Greek ideas to the wider Orthodoxy .
Following the Fourth Crusade and the fall of Constantinople to the `` Latin Empire '' in 1204 mainland Greece was split between the Greek Despotate of Epirus # Foundation ( a Byzantine successor state ) and Kingdom of France rule ( known as the Frankokratia ) , while some islands came under Republic of Venice rule . The re-establishment of the Byzantine imperial capital in Constantinople in 1261 was accompanied by the empire 's recovery of much of the Greek peninsula , although the Frankish Principality of Achaea in the Peloponnese and the rival Greek Despotate of Epirus in the north both remained important regional powers into the 14th century , while the islands remained largely under Genoese and Venetian control . During the Byzantine Empire under the Palaiologos dynasty ( 12611453 ) a new era of Greek patriotism emerged accompanied by a turning back to ancient Greece .
As such prominent personalities at the time also proposed changing the imperial title to `` Emperor of the Hellenes '' , and , in late fourteenth century , the emperor was frequently referred to as the `` Emperor of the Hellenes '' . Similarly , in several international treaties of that time the Byzantine emperor is styled as `` Imperator Graecorum '' .
In the 14th century , much of the Greek peninsula was lost by the Byzantine Empire at first to the Serbs and then to the Ottomans . By the beginning of the 15th century , the Ottoman advance meant that Byzantine territory in Greece was limited mainly to its then-largest city , Thessaloniki , and the Peloponnese ( Despotate of the Morea ) . After the fall of Constantinople to the Ottomans in 1453 , the Morea was one of the last remnants of the Byzantine Empire to hold out against the Ottomans . However , this , too , fell to the Ottomans in 1460 , completing the Ottoman conquest of mainland Greece . With the Turkish conquest , many Byzantine Greek scholars , who up until then were largely responsible for preserving Classical Greece knowledge , fled to the West , taking with them a large body of literature and thereby significantly Greek scholars in the Renaissance .
=== Venetian possessions and Ottoman rule ( 15th century  1821 ) ===
While most of mainland Greece and the Aegean islands was under Ottoman control by the end of the 15th century , Cyprus and Crete remained Republic of Venice territory and did not fall to the Ottomans until 1571 and 1670 respectively . The only part of the Greek-speaking world that escaped long-term Ottoman rule was the Ionian Islands , which remained Venetian until their capture by the First French Republic in 1797 , then passed to the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland in 1809 until their unification with Greece in 1864.
While some Greeks in the Ionian Islands and Constantinople lived in prosperity , and Greeks of Constantinople ( Phanariotes ) achieved positions of power within the Ottoman administration , much of the population of mainland Greece suffered the economic consequences of the Ottoman conquest . Heavy taxes were enforced , and in later years the Ottoman Empire enacted a policy of creation of hereditary estates , effectively turning the rural Greek populations into serfdom .
The Greek Orthodox Church and the Ecumenical Patriarchate of Constantinople were considered by the Ottoman governments as the ruling authorities of the entire Eastern Orthodox Church population of the Ottoman Empire , whether ethnically Greek or not . Although the Ottoman state did not force non-Muslims to convert to Islam , Christians faced several types of discrimination intended to highlight their inferior status in the Ottoman Empire . Discrimination against Christians , particularly when combined with harsh treatment by local Ottoman authorities , led to conversions to Islam , if only superficially . In the 19th century , many `` crypto-Christians '' returned to their old religious allegiance .
The nature of Ottoman administration of Greece varied , though it was invariably arbitrary and often harsh . Some cities had governors appointed by the Ottoman Sultan , while others ( like Athens ) were self-governed municipalities . Mountainous regions in the interior and many islands remained effectively autonomous from the central Ottoman state for many centuries .
When military conflicts broke out between the Ottoman Empire and other states , Greeks usually took up arms against the Ottomans , with few exceptions . Prior to the Greek Revolution of 1821 , there had been a number of wars which saw Greeks fight against the Ottomans , such as the Greek participation in the Battle of Lepanto in 1571 , the Epirus peasants ' revolts of 16001601 ( led by the Orthodox bishop Dionysios Skylosophos ) , the Morean War of 16841699 , and the Russian Empire-instigated Orlov Revolt in 1770 , which aimed at breaking up the Ottoman Empire in favour of Russian interests . These uprisings were put down by the Ottomans with great bloodshed . On the other side , many Greeks were conscripted as Ottoman citizens to serve in the Ottoman army ( and especially the Ottoman navy ) , while also the Ecumenical Patriarchate of Constantinople , responsible for the Orthodox , remained in general loyal to the empire .
The 16th and 17th centuries are regarded as something of a `` dark age '' in Greek history , with the prospect of overthrowing Ottoman rule appearing remote with only the Ionian islands remaining free of Turkish domination . Corfu withstood three major sieges in Siege of Corfu ( 1537 ) , 1571 and Siege of Corfu ( 1716 ) # The Siege of Corfu all of which resulted in the repulsion of the Ottomans . However , in the 18th century , due to their mastery of shipping and commerce , a wealthy and dispersed Greek merchant class arose . These merchants came to dominate trade within the Ottoman Empire , establishing communities throughout the Mediterranean , the Balkans , and Western Europe . Though the Ottoman conquest had cut Greece off from significant European intellectual movements such as the Reformation and the Age of Enlightenment , these ideas together with the ideals of the French Revolution and romantic nationalism began to penetrate the Greek world via the mercantile diaspora . In the late 18th century , Rigas Feraios , the first revolutionary to envision an independent Greek state , published a series of documents relating to Greek independence , including but not limited to a national anthem and the first detailed map of Greece , in Vienna . Feraios was murdered by Ottoman agents in 1798.
=== Modern period ===
==== Greek War of Independence ( 18211832 ) ====
In the late eighteenth century , an increase in secular learning during the Modern Greek Enlightenment led to the revival among Greeks of the diaspora of the Greek nationalism tracing its existence to ancient Greece , distinct from the other Orthodox peoples , and having a right to political autonomy . One of the organizations formed in this intellectual milieu was the Filiki Eteria , a secret organization formed by merchants in Odessa in 1814 . Appropriating a long-standing tradition of Eastern Orthodox Church messianic prophecy aspiring to the resurrection of the eastern Roman empire and creating the impression they had the backing of Russian Empire , they managed amidst a crisis of Ottoman trade , from 1815 onwards , to engage traditional strata of the Greek Orthodox world in their liberal nationalist cause . The Filiki Eteria planned to launch revolution in the Peloponnese , the Danubian Principalities and Constantinople . The first of these revolts began on 6 March 1821 in the Danubian Principalities under the leadership of Alexander Ypsilantis ( 17921828 ) , but it was soon put down by the Ottomans . The events in the north spurred the Greeks of the Peloponnese into action and on 17 March 1821 the Maniots declared war on the Ottomans .
By the end of the month , the Peloponnese was in open revolt against the Ottomans and by October 1821 the Greeks under Theodoros Kolokotronis had captured Tripoli , Greece . The Peloponnesian revolt was quickly followed by revolts in Crete , Macedonia ( Greece ) and Central Greece , which would soon be suppressed . Meanwhile , the makeshift Greek navy was achieving success against the Ottoman navy in the Aegean Sea and prevented Ottoman reinforcements from arriving by sea . In 1822 and 1824 the Turks and Egyptians ravaged the islands , including Chios Massacre and Destruction of Psara , committing wholesale Massacres during the Greek Revolution of the population . Approximately three-quarters of the Chios ' Greek population of 120,000 were Chios massacre killed , enslaved or died of disease . This had the effect of galvanizing public opinion in western Europe in favour of the Greek rebels .
Tensions soon developed among different Greek factions , leading to two consecutive civil wars . Meanwhile , the Ottoman Sultan negotiated with Mehmet Ali of Egypt , who agreed to send his son Ibrahim Pasha of Egypt to Greece with an army to suppress the revolt in return for territorial gain . Ibrahim landed in the Peloponnese in February 1825 and had immediate success : by the end of 1825 , most of the Peloponnese was under Egyptian control , and the city of Missolonghiput under siege by the Turks since April 1825fell in April 1826 . Although Ibrahim was defeated in Mani Peninsula , he had succeeded in suppressing most of the revolt in the Peloponnese and Athens had been retaken .
After years of negotiation , three great powers , Bourbon Restoration , Russian Empire , and the United Kingdom , decided to intervene in the conflict and each nation sent a navy to Greece . Following news that combined OttomanEgyptian fleets were going to attack the Greek island of Hydra , Saronic Islands , the allied fleet intercepted the OttomanEgyptian fleet at Pylos . A week-long standoff ended with the Battle of Navarino ( 20 October 1827 ) which resulted in the destruction of the OttomanEgyptian fleet . A Morea expedition was dispatched to supervise the evacuation of the Egyptian army from the Peloponnese , while the Greeks proceeded to the captured part of Central Greece by 1828 . As a result of years of negotiation , the First Hellenic Republic was finally recognised under the London Protocol ( 1830 ) in 1830.
====Kingdom of Greece====
In 1827 , Ioannis Kapodistrias , from Corfu , was chosen by the Third National Assembly at Troezen as the first governor of the First Hellenic Republic . Kapodistrias established a series of state , economic and military institutions . Soon tensions appeared between him and local interests . Following his assassination in 1831 and the subsequent London Conference of 1832 a year later , the Great Powers of Britain , France and Russia installed Bavarian Prince Otto of Greece as Kingdom of Greece ( Wittelsbach ) . Otto 's reign was despotism , and in its first 11 years of independence Greece was ruled by a Bavarian oligarchy led by Joseph Ludwig von Armansperg as Prime Minister of Greece and , later , by Otto himself , who held the title of both King and Premier . Throughout this period Greece remained under the influence of its three protecting great power , July Monarchy , Russian Empire , and the United Kingdom , as well as Kingdom of Bavaria . In 1843 an uprising forced the king to grant a constitution and a representative assembly .
Despite the absolute monarchy of Otto 's reign , the early years proved instrumental in creating institutions which are still the bedrock of Greek administration and education . Important steps were taken in the creation of the education system , maritime and postal communications , effective civil administration and , most importantly , the legal code . Historical revisionism took the form of de-Byzantine Empire and de-Ottoman Empire , in favour of promoting the country 's ancient Greece heritage . In this spirit , the national capital was moved from Nafplio , where it had been since 1829 , to Athens , which was at the time a village . Religious reform also took place , and the Church of Greece was established as Greece 's national church , although Otto remained a Catholic church . 25 March , the day of Annunciation , was chosen as the anniversary of the Greek War of Independence in order to reinforce the link between Greek identity and Orthodoxy . Pavlos Karolidis called the Bavarian efforts to create a modern state in Greece as `` not only appropriate for the peoples ' needs , but also based on excellent administrative principles of the era '' .
Otto was deposed in the 23 October 1862 Revolution . Multiple causes led to his deposition and exile , including the Bavarian-dominated government , heavy taxation , and a failed attempt to annex Crete from the Ottoman Empire . The catalyst for the revolt was Otto 's dismissal of Konstantinos Kanaris from the Premiership . A year later , he was replaced by Prince Wilhelm ( William ) of Denmark , who took the name George I of Greece and brought with him the Ionian Islands as a coronation gift from Britain . A Greek Constitution of 1864 changed Greece 's form of government from constitutional monarchy to the more democratic crowned republic . In 1875 the concept of parliamentary majority as a requirement for the formation of a government was introduced by Charilaos Trikoupis , curbing the power of the monarchy to appoint minority governments of its preference .
Corruption , coupled with Trikoupis ' increased spending to fund infrastructure projects like the Corinth Canal , overtaxed the weak Greek economy and forced the declaration of Sovereign default in 1893 . Greece also accepted the imposition of an International Financial Control authority to pay off the country 's debtors . Another political issue in 19th-century Greece was uniquely Greek : the language question . The Greek people spoke a form of Greek called Modern Greek . Many of the educated elite saw this as a peasant dialect and were determined to restore the glories of Ancient Greek .
Government documents and newspapers were consequently published in Katharevousa ( purified ) Greek , a form which few ordinary Greeks could read . Liberals favoured recognising Demotic as the national language , but conservatives and the Orthodox Church resisted all such efforts , to the extent that , when the New Testament was translated into Demotic in 1901 , riots erupted in Athens and the government fell ( the Evangeliaka ) . This issue would continue to plague Greek politics until the 1970s .
All Greeks were united , however , in their determination to liberate the regions of ancient Greece under Ottoman rule . Especially in Crete , a Cretan Revolt ( 18661869 ) prolonged revolt in 18661869 had raised nationalist fervour . When war broke out between Russo-Turkish War ( 18771878 ) , Greek popular sentiment rallied to Russia 's side , but Greece was too poor and too concerned about British intervention , to officially enter the war . Nevertheless , in 1881 , Thessaly and small parts of Epirus ( region ) were ceded to Greece as part of the Treaty of Berlin , 1878 , while frustrating Greek hopes of receiving Crete .
Greeks in Crete continued to stage regular revolts , and in 1897 , the Greek government under Theodoros Deligiannis , bowing to popular pressure , declared war on the Ottomans . In the ensuing Greco-Turkish War ( 1897 ) Greco-Turkish War of 1897 , the badly trained and equipped Greek army was defeated by the Ottomans . Through the intervention of the Great Powers , however , Greece lost only a little territory along the border to Turkey , while Crete was established as an Cretan State under Prince George of Greece . With state coffers empty , fiscal policy came under International Financial Control . Alarmed by the abortive Ilinden uprising of the Autonomism ( political doctrine ) Internal Macedonian Revolutionary Organization ( IMRO ) in 1903 , the Greek government , aiming to quell Komitadjis ( IMRO bands ) and detach the Slavic speakers in Ottoman Macedonia from Bulgarian Macedonians influence , sponsored a guerrilla warfare campaign in Ottoman-ruled Macedonia ( region ) , led by Greek officers and known as the Macedonian Struggle , which ended with the Young Turk Revolution in 1908.
==== Expansion , disaster , and reconstruction ====
Amidst general dissatisfaction with the seeming inertia and unattainability of Megali Idea under the premiership of the cautious reformist Georgios Theotokis , a group of military officers organised a Goudi coup in August 1909 and shortly thereafter called to Athens Cretan State politician Eleftherios Venizelos , who conveyed a vision of national regeneration . After winning Greek legislative election , August 1910 Greek legislative election , November 1910 and becoming Prime Minister in 1910 , Venizelos initiated wide-ranging fiscal , social , and Greek Constitution of 1911 , reorganised the military , made Greece a member of the Balkan League , and led the country through the Balkan Wars . By 1913 , Greece 's territory and population had almost doubled , annexing Crete , Epirus ( region ) , and Macedonia ( Greece ) . In the following years , the struggle between Constantine I of Greece and charismatic Venizelos over the country 's foreign policy on the eve of First World War dominated the country 's political scene and divided the country into National Schism . During parts of the WW1 , Greece had two governments : A royalist Central Powers pro-German one in Athens and a Venizelism pro-Triple Entente one in Thessaloniki . The two governments were united in 1917 , when Greece officially entered the war on the side of the Entente .
In the aftermath of World War I , Greece attempted further expansion into Asia Minor , a region with a large native Greek population at the time , but was defeated in the Greco-Turkish War ( 191922 ) Greco-Turkish War of 19191922 , contributing to a massive flight of Ottoman Greeks . These events overlapped , with both happening during the Greek genocide ( 19141922 ) , a period during which , according to various sources , Ottoman and Turkish officials contributed to the death of several hundred thousand Asia Minor Greeks , along with similar numbers of Assyrian genocide and a rather larger number of Armenian genocide . The resultant Greek exodus from Asia Minor was made permanent , and expanded , in an official Population exchange between Greece and Turkey . The exchange was part of the terms of the Treaty of Lausanne which ended the war .
The following era was marked by instability , as over 1.5 million propertyless Greek refugees from Turkey had to be integrated into Greek society . Cappadocian Greeks , Pontian Greeks , and Antiochian Greeks non-Greek followers of Greek Orthodoxy were all subject to the exchange as well . Some of the refugees could not speak the language and were from what had been unfamiliar environments to mainland Greeks , such as in the case of the Cappadocians and non-Greeks . The refugees also made a dramatic post-war population boost , as the number of refugees was more than a quarter of Greece 's prior population .
Following the catastrophic events in Asia Minor , the monarchy was abolished Greek republic referendum , 1924 in 1924 and the Second Hellenic Republic was declared . In 1935 , a royalist general-turned-politician Georgios Kondylis took power after a coup d'tat and abolished the republic , holding Greek monarchy referendum , 1935 , after which George II of Greece returned to Greece and was restored to the throne .
==== Dictatorship , World War II , and reconstruction ====
An agreement between Prime Minister Ioannis Metaxas and the head of state George II of Greece followed in 1936 , which installed Metaxas as the head of a dictatorial regime known as the 4th of August Regime , inaugurating a period of authoritarian rule that would last , with short breaks , until 1974 . Although a dictatorship , Greece remained on good terms with Britain and was not allied with the Axis powers .
On 28 October 1940 , Kingdom of Italy demanded the surrender of Greece , but the Greek administration refused , and , in the following Greco-Italian War , Greece repelled Italian forces into Albania , giving the Allies of World War II their first victory over Axis forces on land . The Greek struggle and victory against the Italians received exuberant praise at the time . Most prominent is the quote attributed to Winston Churchill : `` Hence we will not say that Greeks fight like heroes , but we will say that heroes fight like Greeks . '' French general Charles de Gaulle was among those who praised the fierceness of the Greek resistance . In an official notice released to coincide with the Greek national celebration of the Day of Independence , De Gaulle expressed his admiration for the Greek resistance : In the name of the captured yet still alive French people , France wants to send her greetings to the Greek people who are fighting for their freedom . The 25 March 1941 finds Greece in the peak of their heroic struggle and in the top of their glory . Since the Battle of Salamis , Greece had not achieved the greatness and the glory which today holds . The country would eventually fall to urgently dispatched Nazi Germany forces during the Battle of Greece , despite the fierce Greek resistance , particularly in the Battle of the Metaxas Line . Adolf Hitler himself recognised the bravery and the courage of the Greek army , stating in his address to the Reichstag on 11 December 1941 , that : `` Historical justice obliges me to state that of the enemies who took up positions against us , the Greek soldier particularly fought with the highest courage . He capitulated only when further resistance had become impossible and useless . ''
The Nazis proceeded to administer Athens and Thessaloniki , while other regions of the country were given to Nazi Germany 's partners , Fascist Italy and Bulgaria . The occupation brought about terrible hardships for the Greek civilian population . Over 100,000 civilians died of starvation during the winter of 19411942 , tens of thousands more died because of reprisals by Nazis and Collaboration with the Axis Powers during World War II # Greece , the country 's economy was ruined , and the great majority of History of the Jews in Greece ( tens of thousands ) were deported and murdered in Nazi concentration camps . The Greek Resistance , one of the most effective resistance movements in Europe , fought vehemently against the Nazis and their collaborators . The German occupiers committed German war crimes # Greece numerous atrocities , mass executions , and wholesale slaughter of civilians and destruction of towns and villages in reprisals . In the course of the concerted anti-guerrilla campaign , hundreds of villages were systematically torched and almost 1 million Greeks left homeless . In total , the Germans executed some 21,000 Greeks , the Bulgarians 40,000 , and the Italians 9,000.
Following liberation and the Allied victory over the Axis , Greece annexed the Dodecanese Islands from Italy and regained Western Thrace from Bulgaria . The country almost immediately descended into Greek Civil War between Communism forces and the anti-communist Greek government , which lasted until 1949 with the latter 's victory . The conflict , considered one of the earliest struggles of the Cold War , resulted in further economic devastation , mass population displacement and severe political polarisation for the next thirty years .
Although the post-war decades were characterised by social strife and widespread marginalisation of the left in political and social spheres , Greece nonetheless experienced Greek economic miracle and recovery , propelled in part by the U.S.-administered Marshall Plan . In 1952 , Greece joined NATO , reinforcing its membership in the Western Bloc of the Cold War .
====Military regime ( 196774 ) ====
King Constantine II of Greece 's Apostasia of 1965 of George Papandreou ( senior ) 's centrist government in July 1965 prompted a prolonged period of political turbulence , which culminated in a coup d'tat on 21 April 1967 by the Greek military junta of 19671974 . Under the junta , civil rights were suspended , political repression was intensified , and human rights abuses , including state-sanctioned torture , were rampant . Economic growth remained rapid before plateauing in 1972 . The brutal suppression of the Athens Polytechnic uprising on 17 November 1973 set in motion the events that caused the fall of the Papadopoulos regime , resulting in a counter-coup which overthrew Georgios Papadopoulos and established brigadier Dimitrios Ioannidis as the new junta strongman . On 20 July 1974 , Turkish invasion of Cyprus in response to a Greek-backed Cypriot coup , triggering a political crisis in Greece that led to the regime 's collapse and the restoration of democracy through Metapolitefsi .
==== Third Hellenic Republic ====
The former prime minister Konstantinos Karamanlis was invited back from Paris where he had lived in self-exile since 1963 , marking the beginning of the Metapolitefsi era . The Greek legislative election , 1974 since 1964 were held on the first anniversary of the Polytechnic uprising . A democratic and republican Constitution of Greece was promulgated on 11 June 1975 following a Greek republic referendum , 1974 which chose to not restore the monarchy .
Meanwhile , Andreas Papandreou , George Papandreou 's son , founded the Panhellenic Socialist Movement ( PASOK ) in response to Karamanlis 's conservative New Democracy ( Greece ) party , with the two political formations dominating in government over the next four decades . Greece rejoined NATO in 1980 . Greece became the tenth member of the European Communities ( subsequently subsumed by the European Union ) on 1 January 1981 , ushering in a period of sustained growth . Widespread investments in industrial enterprises and heavy infrastructure , as well as funds from the European Union and growing revenues from tourism , shipping , and a fast-growing service sector raised the country 's standard of living to unprecedented levels . Traditionally strained GreekTurkish relations GreekTurkish earthquake diplomacy , leading to the lifting of the Greek veto against Accession of Turkey to the European Union Turkey 's bid for EU membership .
The country adopted the euro in 2001 and successfully hosted the 2004 Summer Olympics in Athens . More recently , Greece has suffered greatly from the late-2000s recession and has been central to the related European sovereign debt crisis . Due to the adoption of the euro , when Greece experienced financial crisis , it could no longer Devaluation its currency to regain competitiveness . Youth unemployment was especially high during the 2000s . The Greek government-debt crisis , and subsequent austerity policies , have resulted in protests and social strife .
== Geography and climate ==
Located in Southern Europe and Southeast Europe , Greece consists of a mountainous , peninsular mainland jutting out into the sea at the southern end of the Balkans , ending at the Peloponnese peninsula ( separated from the mainland by the Corinth Canal of the Isthmus of Corinth ) and strategically located at the crossroads of Europe , Asia , and Africa . Due to its highly indented coastline and numerous islands , Greece has the List of countries by length of coastline in the world with ; its land boundary is . The country lies approximately between latitudes 35th parallel north 34 and 42nd parallel north 42 N , and longitudes 19th meridian east 19 and 30th meridian east 30 E , with the extreme points being :
* North : Ormenio village
* South : Gavdos island
* East : Strongyli Megistis ( Kastelorizo , Megisti ) island
* West : Othonoi island
Eighty percent of Greece consists of mountains or hills , making the country one of the most mountainous in Europe . Mount Olympus , the mythical abode of the Twelve Olympians , culminates at Mytikas peak , the highest in the country . Western Greece contains a number of lakes and wetlands and is dominated by the Pindus mountain range . The Pindus , a continuation of the Dinaric Alps , reaches a maximum elevation of at Smolikas Mt . Smolikas ( the second-highest in Greece ) and historically has been a significant barrier to eastwest travel .
The Pindus range continues through the central Peloponnese , crosses the islands of Kythera and Antikythera and finds its way into southwestern Aegean , in the island of Crete where it eventually ends . The islands of the Aegean are peaks of underwater mountains that once constituted an extension of the mainland . Pindus is characterised by its high , steep peaks , often dissected by numerous canyons and a variety of other karstic landscapes . The spectacular Vikos Gorge , part of the Vikos-Aoos National Park in the Pindus range , is listed by the Guinness book of World Records as the deepest gorge in the world . Another notable formation are the Meteora rock pillars , atop which have been built medieval Greek Orthodox monasteries .
Northeastern Greece features another high-altitude mountain range , the Rhodope Mountains range , spreading across the region of East Macedonia and Thrace ; this area is covered with vast , thick , ancient forests , including the famous Dadia Forest in the Evros ( regional unit ) , in the far northeast of the country .
Extensive plains are primarily located in the regions of Thessaly , Central Macedonia and Western Thrace . They constitute key economic regions as they are among the few arable places in the country . Rare marine species such as the pinniped seals and the loggerhead sea turtle live in the seas surrounding mainland Greece , while its dense forests are home to the endangered brown bear , the Eurasian lynx , the roe deer and the wild goat .
=== Islands ===
Greece features a List of islands of Greece - between 1,200 and 6,000 , depending on the definition , 227 of which are inhabited - and is considered a List of transcontinental countries # Non-contiguous non-contiguous transcontinental country . Crete is the largest and most populous island ; Euboea , separated from the mainland by the 60 ; m-wide Euripus Strait , is the second largest , followed by Lesbos and Rhodes .
The Greek islands are traditionally grouped into the following clusters : the Argo-Saronic Islands in the Saronic gulf near Athens , the Cyclades , a large but dense collection occupying the central part of the Aegean Sea , the North Aegean islands , a loose grouping off the west coast of Turkey , the Dodecanese , another loose collection in the southeast between Crete and Turkey , the Sporades , a small tight group off the coast of northeast Euboea , and the Ionian Islands , located to the west of the mainland in the Ionian Sea .
=== Climate ===
The climate of Greece is primarily Mediterranean climate , featuring mild , wet winters and hot , dry summers . This climate occurs at all coastal locations , including Athens , the Cyclades , the Dodecanese , Crete , the Peloponnese , the Ionian Islands and parts of the Central Continental Greece region . The Pindus mountain range strongly affects the climate of the country , as areas to the west of the range are considerably wetter on average ( due to greater exposure to south-westerly systems bringing in moisture ) than the areas lying to the east of the range ( due to a rain shadow effect ) .
The mountainous areas of Northwestern Greece ( parts of Epirus ( region ) , Central Greece , Thessaly , Western Macedonia ) as well as in the mountainous central parts of Peloponnese ;  including parts of the regional units of Achaea , Arcadia ( regional unit ) and Laconia ;  feature an Alpine climate with heavy snowfalls . The inland parts of northern Greece , in Central Macedonia and East Macedonia and Thrace feature a temperate climate with cold , damp winters and hot , dry summers with frequent thunderstorms . Snowfalls occur every year in the mountains and northern areas , and brief snowfalls are not unknown even in low-lying southern areas , such as Athens .
=== Biodiversity ===
Phytogeography , Greece belongs to the Boreal Kingdom and is shared between the East Mediterranean province of the Mediterranean Region and the Illyrian province of the Circumboreal Region . According to the World Wide Fund for Nature and the European Environment Agency , the territory of Greece can be subdivided into six ecoregions : the Illyrian deciduous forests , Pindus Mountains mixed forests , Balkan mixed forests , Rhodope montane mixed forests , Aegean and Western Turkey sclerophyllous and mixed forests , and Crete Mediterranean forests . It had a 2018 Forest Landscape Integrity Index mean score of 6.6/10 , ranking it 70th globally out of 172 countries .
== Politics ==
Greece is a unitary state parliamentary republic . The current Constitution of Greece was drawn up and adopted by the Fifth Revisionary Parliament of the Hellenes and entered into force in 1975 after the fall of the Greek military junta of 19671974 military junta of 19671974 . It has been revised three times since , in Greek constitutional amendment of 1986 , Greek Constitutional amendment of 2001 and Greek constitutional amendment of 2008 . The Constitution , which consists of 120 articles , provides for a separation of powers into executive branch , legislative branch , and judicial branches , and grants extensive specific guarantees ( further reinforced in 2001 ) of civil liberties and social rights . Women 's suffrage was guaranteed with an amendment to the 1952 Constitution .
The nominal [ of state ] is the President of Greece , who is elected by the Hellenic Parliament for a five-year term . According to the Constitution , executive power is exercised by the President and the Cabinet of Greece . However , the Greek Constitutional amendment of 1986 curtailed the President 's duties and powers to a significant extent , rendering the position largely ceremonial ; most political power is thus vested in the Prime Minister , Greece 's [ of government ] . The position is filled by the List of Prime Ministers of Greece of the List of political parties in Greece that can obtain a vote of confidence by the Parliament . The President of the Republic formally appoints the Prime Minister and , on his recommendation , appoints and dismisses the other members of the Cabinet .
Legislative powers are exercised by a 300-member elective unicameralism . Statutes passed by the Parliament are promulgated by the President of the Republic . Elections in Greece # Election of the legislature are held every four years , but the President of the Republic is obliged to dissolve the Parliament earlier on the proposal of the Cabinet , in view of dealing with a national issue of exceptional importance . The President is also obliged to dissolve the Parliament earlier , if the opposition manages to pass a motion of no confidence . The voting age is 17.
According to a 2016 report by the OECD , Greeks display a moderate level of civic participation compared to most other developed countries ; voter turnout was 64 percent during recent elections , lower than the OECD average of 69 percent .
=== Political parties ===
Since the restoration of democracy , the Greek party system was dominated by the liberal-conservative New Democracy ( Greece ) ( ND ) and the social-democratic PASOK ( PASOK ) . Other parties represented in the Hellenic Parliament include the Syriza ( SYRIZA ) , the Communist Party of Greece ( KKE ) , Greek Solution and MeRA25 .
PASOK and New Democracy largely alternated in power until the outbreak of the Greek government-debt crisis government-debt crisis in 2009 . From that time , the two major parties , New Democracy and PASOK , experienced a sharp decline in popularity . In November 2011 , the two major parties joined the smaller Popular Orthodox Rally in a grand coalition , pledging their parliamentary support for a government of national unity headed by former European Central Bank vice-president Lucas Papademos . Panos Kammenos voted against this government and he split off from ND forming the Right-wing populism right-wing populist Independent Greeks .
The coalition government led the country to the Greek legislative election , May 2012 . The power of the traditional Greek political parties , PASOK and New Democracy ( Greece ) , declined from 43 % to 13 % and from 33 % to 18 % , respectively . The left-wing party of SYRIZA became the second major party , with an increase from 4 % to 16 % . No party could form a sustainable government , which led to the Greek legislative election , June 2012 . The result of the second elections was the formation of a coalition government composed of New Democracy ( Greece ) ( 29 % ) , PASOK ( 12 % ) and Democratic Left ( Greece ) ( 6 % ) parties .
SYRIZA has since overtaken PASOK as the main party of the centre-left . Alexis Tsipras led SYRIZA to victory in the Greek legislative election , January 2015 held on 25 January 2015 , falling short of an outright majority in Parliament by just two seats . The following morning , Tsipras reached an agreement with Independent Greeks party to form a coalition , and he was sworn in as Prime Minister of Greece . Tsipras called snap elections in August 2015 , resigning from his post , which led to a month-long caretaker administration headed by judge Vassiliki Thanou-Christophilou , Greece 's first female prime minister . In the Greek legislative election , September 2015 , Alexis Tsipras led SYRIZA to another victory , winning 145 out of 300 seats and re-forming the coalition with the Independent Greeks . However , he was defeated in the 2019 Greek legislative election by Kyriakos Mitsotakis who leads New Democracy .
=== Foreign relations ===
Greece 's foreign policy is conducted through the Ministry of Foreign Affairs ( Greece ) and its head , the Minister for Foreign Affairs ( Greece ) , currently Nikos Dendias . Officially , the main aims of the Ministry are to represent Greece before other states and international organizations ; safeguard the interests of the Greek state and of its citizens abroad ; promote Greek culture ; foster closer relations with the Greek diaspora ; and encourage international cooperation . The Ministry identifies two issues of particular importance to the Greek state : GreekTurkish relations in the Aegean Sea and corresponding airspace and the Cyprus dispute involving the Turkish military forces in Northern Cyprus of Northern Cyprus .
There is a long-standing Aegean dispute over natural resources in the eastern Mediterranean . Turkey does n't recognize a legal continental shelf and exclusive economic zone around the Greek islands .
Additionally , due to its political and geographical proximity to Europe , Asia , the Middle East and Africa , Greece is a country of significant geostrategic importance , which it has leveraged to develop a regional policy to help promote peace and stability in the Balkans , the Mediterranean , and the Middle East . This has accorded the country middle power status in global affairs .

== Economy ==
=== Introduction ===
According to World Bank statistics for the year 2013 , the economy of Greece is the List of countries by GDP ( nominal ) largest by nominal GDP gross domestic product at $ 242 billion and List of countries by GDP ( PPP ) largest by purchasing power parity ( PPP ) at $ 284 billion . Additionally , Greece is the 15th largest economy in the 27-member European Union . In terms of per capita income , Greece is ranked List of countries by GDP ( nominal ) per capita or List of countries by GDP ( PPP ) per capita in the world at $ 18,168 and $ 29,045 for nominal GDP and PPP respectively . The Greek economy is classified as advanced and [ income economy high-income ] .
Greece is a developed country with a high standard of living and a high ranking in the Human Development Index . Its economy mainly comprises the service sector ( 85.0 % ) and industrial sector ( 12.0 % ) , while agriculture makes up 3.0 % of the national economic output . Important Greek industries include Tourism in Greece ( with 14.9 million international tourists in 2009 , it is ranked as the 7th most visited country in the European Union and 16th in the world by the United Nations World Tourism Organization ) and Greek Merchant Navy ( at 16.2 % of the world 's total capacity , the Greek merchant marine is the largest in the world ) , while the country is also a considerable agricultural producer ( including fisheries ) within the union .
Greek unemployment stood at 21.7 % in April 2017 . The youth unemployment rate ( 42.3 % in March 2018 ) is extremely high compared to EU standards .
With an economy larger than all the other Balkan economies combined , Greece is the largest economy in the Balkans , and an important regional investor . Greece is the number-two foreign investor of capital in Albania , the number-three foreign investor in Bulgaria , at the top-three of foreign investors in Romania and Serbia and the most important trading partner and largest foreign investor of North Macedonia . Greek banks open a new branch somewhere in the Balkans on an almost weekly basis . The Greek telecommunications company OTE has become a strong investor in Yugoslavia and other Balkan countries .
Greece was a founding member of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development ( OECD ) and the Organization of the Black Sea Economic Cooperation ( BSEC ) . In 1979 the accession of the country in the European Communities and the Internal Market ( European Union ) was signed , and the process was completed in 1982 . Greece was accepted into the Economic and Monetary Union of the European Union on 19 June 2000 , and in January 2001 adopted the Euro as its currency , replacing the Greek drachma at an exchange rate of 340.75 drachma to the Euro . Greece is also a member of the International Monetary Fund and the World Trade Organization , and is ranked 24th on the KOF Globalization Index for 2013.
=== Debt crisis ( 20102018 ) ===
The Greek economy had fared well for much of the 20th century , with high growth rates and low public debt ) . Even until the eve of the Financial crisis of 20072008 , it featured high rates of growth , which , however , were coupled with high structural deficits , thus maintaining a ( roughly unchanged throughout this period ) public debt to GDP ratio of just over 100 % . The Greek crisis was triggered by the turmoil of the 20072009 Great Recession , which led the budget deficits of several Western nations to reach or exceed 10 % of GDP . In Greece 's case , the high budget deficit ( which , after several corrections and revisions , was revealed that it had been allowed to reach 10.2 % and 15.1 % of GDP in 2008 and 2009 , respectively ) was coupled with a high public debt to GDP ratio ( relatively stable , at just over 100 % until 2007 - as calculated after all corrections ) . Thus , the country appeared to lose control of its public debt to GDP ratio , which already reached 127 % of GDP in 2009 . In addition , being a member of the Eurozone , the country had essentially no autonomous Economic and Monetary Union of the European Union # Monetary policy inflexibility .
Finally , there was an effect of controversies about Greek statistics ( due to the aforementioned drastic budget deficit revisions which led to an increase in the calculated value of the Greek public debt by Greek financial audits , 200910 about 10 % , i.e. , a public debt to GDP of about 100 % until 2007 ) , while there have been arguments about a possible effect of Greek government-debt crisis # Criticism of the role of news media and stereotyping . Consequently , Greece was `` punished '' by the markets which increased borrowing rates , making it impossible for the country to finance its debt since early 2010.
The above revisions were largely connected with the fact that in the years before the crisis Goldman Sachs , JPMorgan Chase , and numerous other banks had developed financial products which enabled the governments of Greece , Italy , and many other European countries to hide their borrowing . Dozens of similar agreements were concluded across Europe whereby banks supplied cash in advance in exchange for future payments by the governments involved ; in turn , the liabilities of the involved countries were `` kept off the books '' . These conditions had enabled Greece as well as other European governments to spend beyond their means , while meeting the deficit targets set out in the Maastricht Treaty .
In May 2010 , the Greece 's deficit was again revised and estimated to be 13.6 % which was the second highest in the world relative to GDP , with Iceland in first place at 15.7 % and the United Kingdom in third with 12.6 % . Public debt was forecast , according to some estimates , to hit 120 % of GDP in the same year , causing a crisis of confidence in Greece 's ability pay back loans .
To avert a sovereign default , Greece , the other Eurozone members , and the International Monetary Fund agreed on a rescue package which involved giving Greece an immediate  in loans , with additional funds to follow , totaling  . To secure the funding , Greece was required to adopt harsh Austerity to bring its deficit under control . A second bail-out amounting to  ( $ ) was agreed in 2012 , subject to strict conditions , including financial reforms and further austerity measures . A Debt relief was also agreed as part of the deal . Greece achieved a primary government balanced budget in 2013 , while in April 2014 , it returned to the global bond market . Greece returned to growth after six years of economic decline in the second quarter of 2014 , and was the Eurozone 's fastest-growing economy in the third quarter . A third bailout was agreed in July 2015 , after a confrontation with the newly elected government of Alexis Tsipras .
There was a 25 % drop in Greece 's GDP , connected with the bailout programmes . This had a critical effect : the Debt-to-GDP ratio , the key factor defining the severity of the crisis , would jump from its 2009 level of 127 % to about 170 % , solely due to the shrinking economy . In a 2013 report , the IMF admitted that it had underestimated the effects of so extensive tax hikes and budget cuts on the country 's GDP and issued an informal apology . The Greek programmes imposed a very rapid improvement in structural primary balance ( at least two times faster than for other Eurozone bailed-out countries ) . The policies have been blamed for worsening the crisis , while Greece 's president , Prokopis Pavlopoulos , stressed the creditors ' share in responsibility for the depth of the crisis . Greek Prime Minister , Alexis Tsipras , asserted that errors in the design of the first two programmes which led to a loss of 25 % of the Greek economy due to the harsh imposition of excessive austerity .
Between 2009 and 2017 the Greek government debt rose from 300 bn to 318 bn , i.e . by only about 6 % ( thanks , in part , to the 2012 debt restructuring ) ; however , during the same period , the critical debt-to-GDP ratio shot up from 127 % to 179 % basically due to the severe GDP drop Greek government-debt crisis # Effect of applied programmes on the debt crisis .
Greece 's bailouts successfully ended ( as declared ) on 20 August 2018.
=== Agriculture ===
In 2010 , Greece was the European Union 's largest producer of cotton ( 183,800 tons ) and pistachios ( 8,000 tons ) and ranked second in the production of rice ( 229,500 tons ) and olives ( 147,500 tons ) , third in the production of Common fig ( 11,000 tons ) , almonds ( 44,000 tons ) , tomatoes ( 1,400,000 tons ) , and watermelons ( 578,400 tons ) and fourth in the production of tobacco ( 22,000 tons ) . Agriculture contributes 3.8 % of the country 's GDP and employs 12.4 % of the country 's labor force .
Greece is a major beneficiary of the Common Agricultural Policy of the European Union . As a result of the country 's entry to the European Community , much of its agricultural infrastructure has been upgraded and agricultural output increased . Between 2000 and 2007 , organic farming in Greece increased by 885 % , the highest change percentage in the EU .
=== Energy ===
Electricity production in Greece is dominated by the state-owned Public Power Corporation of Greece ( known mostly by its acronym  , transliterated as DEI ) . In 2009 DEI supplied for 85.6 % of all electric energy demand in Greece , while the number fell to 77.3 % in 2010 . Almost half ( 48 % ) of DEI 's power output is generated using lignite , a drop from the 51.6 % in 2009.
Twelve percent of Greece 's electricity comes from hydroelectric power plants and another 20 % from natural gas . Between 2009 and 2010 , independent companies ' energy production increased by 56 % , from 2,709 Kilowatt hour in 2009 to 4,232 GWh in 2010.
In 2012 , renewable energy accounted for 13.8 % of the country 's total energy consumption , a rise from the 10.6 % it accounted for in 2011 , a figure almost equal to the EU average of 14.1 % in 2012 . 10 % of the country 's renewable energy comes from solar power , while most comes from biomass and waste recycling . In line with the European Commission 's Directive on Renewable Energy , Greece aims to get 18 % of its energy from renewable sources by 2020.
In 2013 , according to the independent power transmission operator in Greece (  ) more than 20 % of the electricity in Greece has been produced from renewable energy sources and hydroelectric powerplants . This percentage in April reached 42 % . Greece currently does not have any nuclear power plants in operation ; however , in 2009 the Academy of Athens ( modern ) suggested that research in the possibility of Greek nuclear power plants begin .
=== Maritime industry ===
The shipping industry has been a key element of Greek economic activity since ancient times . Shipping remains one of the country 's most important industries , accounting for 4.5 percent of GDP , employing about 160,000 people ( 4 percent of the workforce ) , and representing a third of the trade deficit .
According to a 2011 report by the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development , the Greek Merchant Navy is the largest in the world at 16.2 percent of total global capacity , up from 15.96 percent in 2010 but below the peak of 18.2 percent in 2006 . The country 's merchant fleet ranks first in total tonnage ( 202 million Deadweight tonnage ) , fourth in total number of ships ( at 3,150 ) , first in both tanker ( ship ) and dry bulk carriers , fourth in the number of container ship , and fifth in other ships . However , today 's fleet roster is smaller than an all-time high of 5,000 ships in the late 1970s . Additionally , the total number of ships flying a Greek flag ( includes non-Greek fleets ) is 1,517 , or 5.3 percent of the world 's dwt ( ranked fifth globally ) .
During the 1960s , the size of the Greek fleet nearly doubled , primarily through the investment undertaken by the shipping magnates , Aristotle Onassis and Stavros Niarchos . The basis of the modern Greek maritime industry was formed after World War II when Greek shipping businessmen were able to amass surplus ships sold to them by the U.S. government through the Ship Sales Act of the 1940s .
Greece has a significant shipbuilding and ship maintenance industry . The six shipyards around the port of Piraeus are among the largest in Europe . In recent years , Greece has also become a leader in the construction and maintenance of luxury yachts .
=== Tourism ===
Tourism has been a key element of the economic activity in the country and one of the country 's most important sectors , contributing 20.6 % of the gross domestic product as of 2018 . Greece welcomed over 28 million visitors in 2016 , which is an increase from the 26.5 million tourists it welcomed in 2015 and the 19.5 million in 2009 , and the 17.7 million tourists in 2007 , making Greece one of the World Tourism rankings # Europe in Europe in the recent years .
The vast majority of visitors in Greece in 2007 came from the European continent , numbering 12.7 million , while the most visitors from a single nationality were those from the United Kingdom , ( 2.6 million ) , followed closely by those from Germany ( 2.3 million ) . In 2010 , the most visited modern regions of Greece of Greece was that of Central Macedonia , with 18 % of the country 's total tourist flow ( amounting to 3.6 million tourists ) , followed by Attica with 2.6 million and the Peloponnese with 1.8 million . Northern Greece is the country 's most-visited geographical region , with 6.5 million tourists , while Central Greece is second with 6.3 million .
In 2010 , Lonely Planet ranked Greece 's northern and second-largest city of Thessaloniki as the world 's fifth-best party town worldwide , comparable to other cities such as Dubai and Montreal . In 2011 , Santorini was voted as `` The World 's Best Island '' in Travel + Leisure . Its neighboring island Mykonos , came in fifth in the European category . There are 18 UNESCO World Heritage Sites in Greece , and Greece is ranked 16th in the world in terms of total sites . 14 further sites are on the tentative list , awaiting nomination .
=== Transport ===
Since the 1980s , the road and rail network of Greece has been significantly modernised . Important works include the Egnatia Odos ( modern road ) A2 ( Egnatia Odos ) motorway , that connects northwestern Greece ( Igoumenitsa ) with northern Greece ( Thessaloniki ) and northeastern Greece ( Kipoi , Evros ) ; the RioAntirrio bridge , the longest suspension cable bridge in Europe ( long ) , connecting the Peloponnese ( Rio , Greece , from Patras ) with Aetolia-Akarnania ( Antirrio ) in western Greece .
Also completed are the Ionia Odos A5 ( Ionia Odos ) motorway that connects northwestern Greece ( Ioannina ) with western Greece ( Antirrio ) ; the last sections of the Motorway 1 ( Greece ) , connecting Athens to Thessaloniki and Evzonoi in northern Greece ; as well as the Motorway 8 ( Greece ) ( part of the Olympia Odos ) in Peloponnese , connecting Athens to Patras . The remaining section of Olympia Odos , connecting Patras with Pyrgos , Ilia , is under planning .
Other important projects that are currently underway , include the construction of the Thessaloniki Metro .
The Athens Metropolitan Area in particular is served by some of the most modern and efficient transport infrastructure in Europe , such as the Athens International Airport , the privately run Attiki Odos A6 ( Attiki Odos ) motorway network and the expanded Athens Metro system .
Most of the Greek islands and many main cities of Greece are connected by air mainly from the two major Greek airlines , Olympic Air and Aegean Airlines . Maritime connections have been improved with modern high-speed craft , including [ and catamarans ] .
Railway connections play a somewhat lesser role in Greece than in many other European countries , but they too have also been expanded , with new suburban/ [ [ commuter rail connections , serviced by Proastiakos around Athens , towards its airport , Kiato and Chalcis ; around Thessaloniki , towards the cities of Larissa and Edessa , Greece ; and around Patras . A modern intercity rail connection between Athens and Thessaloniki has also been established , while an upgrade to double lines in many parts of the network is underway ; along with a P.A.Th.E./P . new double track , standard gauge railway between Athens and Patras ( replacing the old metre-gauge railway metre-gauge PiraeusPatras railway ) which is currently under construction and opening in stages . International railway lines connect Greek cities with the rest of Europe , the Balkans and Turkey .
=== Telecommunications ===
Modern digital information and communication networks reach all areas . There are over of fiber optics and an extensive open-wire network . Broadband internet availability is widespread in Greece : there were a total of 2,252,653 broadband connections , translating to 20 % broadband penetration . According to 2017 data , around 82 % of the general population used the internet regularly .
Internet cafs that provide net access , office applications and multiplayer gaming are also a common sight in the country , while mobile internet on 3G and 4G- LTE ( telecommunication ) cellphone networks and Wi-Fi connections can be found almost everywhere . 3G/4G mobile internet usage has been on a sharp increase in recent years . Based on 2016 data 70 % of Greek internet users have access via 3G/4G mobile . The United Nations International Telecommunication Union ranks Greece among the top 30 countries with a highly developed information and communications infrastructure .
=== Science and technology ===
The General Secretariat for Research and Technology of the Ministry of Development and Competitiveness is responsible for designing , implementing and supervising national research and technological policy . In 2017 , spending on research and development ( R & D ) reached an all-time high of 2 billion , equal to 1.14 percent of GDP .
Although lower than the EU average of 1.93 percent , between 1990 and 1998 , total R & D expenditure in Greece enjoyed the third-highest increase in Europe , after Finland and Ireland . Because of its strategic location , qualified workforce , and political and economic stability , many multinational companies such as Ericsson , Siemens AG , Motorola , Coca-Cola , and Tesla , Inc. have their regional R & D headquarters in Greece .
Greece has several major technology parks with incubator facilities and has been a member of the European Space Agency ( ESA ) since 2005 . Cooperation between ESA and the Hellenic National Space Committee began in 1994 with the signing of the first cooperation agreement . After applying for full membership in 2003 , Greece became the ESA 's sixteenth member on 16 March 2005 . The country participates in the ESA 's telecommunication and technology activities and the Global Monitoring for Environment and Security Initiative .
The National Centre of Scientific Research `` Demokritos '' was founded in 1959 . The original objective of the center was the advancement of nuclear power . Today , its activities cover several fields of science and engineering .
Greece has one of the highest rates of tertiary enrollment in the world , while Greeks are well represented in academia worldwide ; numerous leading Western universities employ a disproportionately high number of Greek faculty . Greek scientific publications have grown significantly in terms of research impact , surpassing both the EU and global average from 2012 to 2016.
Notable Greek scientists of modern times include Georgios Papanikolaou ( inventor of the Pap test ) , mathematician Constantin Carathodory ( known for the Carathodory theorem ( disambiguation ) and Carathodory conjecture ) , astronomer E. M. Antoniadi , archaeologists Ioannis Svoronos , Valerios Stais , Spyridon Marinatos , Manolis Andronikos ( discovered the tomb of Philip II of Macedon in Vergina ) , Indologist Dimitrios Galanos , botanist Theodoros G. Orphanides , such as Michael Dertouzos , Nicholas Negroponte , John Argyris , John Iliopoulos ( 2007 Dirac Prize for his contributions on the physics of the charm quark , a major contribution to the birth of the Standard Model , the modern theory of Elementary Particles ) , Joseph Sifakis ( 2007 Turing Award , the `` Nobel Prize '' of Computer Science ) , Christos Papadimitriou ( 2002 Knuth Prize , 2012 Gdel Prize ) , Mihalis Yannakakis ( 2005 Knuth Prize ) and physicist Dimitri Nanopoulos .
== Demographics ==
According to the official statistical body of Greece , the Hellenic Statistical Authority ( ELSTAT ) , the country 's total population in 2011 was 10,816,286 . Eurostat places the current population at 10.7 million in 2018.
Greek society has changed rapidly over the last several decades , coinciding with the Aging of Europe of declining fertility and rapid aging . The birth rate in 2003 stood at 9.5 per 1,000 inhabitants , significantly lower than the rate of 14.5 per 1,000 in 1981 . At the same time , the mortality rate increased slightly from 8.9 per 1,000 inhabitants in 1981 to 9.6 per 1,000 inhabitants in 2003 . Estimates from 2016 show the birth rate decreasing further still to 8.5 per 1,000 and mortality climbing to 11.2 per 1,000.
The fertility rate of 1.41 children per woman is well below the Replacement fertility rate replacement rate of 2.1 , and is one of the lowest in the world , considerably below the high of 5.47 children born per woman in 1900 . Subsequently , Greece 's median age is 44.2 years , the seventh-highest in the world . In 2001 , 16.71 percent of the population were 65 years old and older , 68.12 percent between the ages of 15 and 64 years old , and 15.18 percent were 14 years old and younger . By 2016 , the proportion of the population age 65 and older had risen to 20.68 percent , while the proportion of those aged 14 and younger declined to slightly below 14 percent .
Marriage rates began declining from almost 71 per 1,000 inhabitants in 1981 until 2002 , only to increase slightly in 2003 to 61 per 1,000 and then fall again to 51 in 2004 . Moreover , divorce rates have seen an increase from 191.2 per 1,000 marriages in 1991 to 239.5 per 1,000 marriages in 2004.
As a result of these trends , the average Greek household is smaller and older than in previous generations . The economic crisis has exacerbated this development , with 350,000-450,000 Greeks , predominantly young adults , emigrating since 2010.
=== Cities ===
Almost two-thirds of the Greek people live in urban areas . Greece 's largest and most influential metropolitan centres are those of Athens and Thessalonikithat latter commonly referred to as the ( wikt :  , ) with metropolitan populations of approximately 4 million and 1 million inhabitants respectively . Other prominent cities with urban populations above 100,000 inhabitants include Patras , Heraklion , Larissa , Volos , Rhodes ( city ) , Ioannina , Agrinio , Chania , and Chalcis .
The table below lists the largest cities in Greece , by population contained in their respective contiguous built up urban areas , which are either made up of many municipalities , evident in the cases of Athens and Thessaloniki , or are contained within a larger single municipality , case evident in most of the smaller cities of the country . The results come from the preliminary figures of the population census that took place in Greece in May 2011.
=== Religion ===
The Greek Constitution recognises Eastern Orthodox Church as the 'prevailing ' faith of the country , while guaranteeing freedom of religious belief for all . The Greek government does not keep statistics on religious groups and censuses do not ask for religious affiliation . According to the U.S. State Department , an estimated 97 % of Greek citizens identify themselves as Eastern Orthodox Church , belonging to the Greek Orthodox Church , which uses the Byzantine rite and the Greek language , the original language of the New Testament . The administration of the Greek territory is shared between the Church of Greece and the Patriarchate of Constantinople .
In a 2010 EurostatEurobarometer poll , 79 % of Greek citizens responded that they `` believe there is a God '' . According to other sources , 15.8 % of Greeks describe themselves as `` very religious '' , which is the highest among all European countries . The survey also found that just 3.5 % never attend a church , compared to 4.9 % in Poland and 59.1 % in the Czech Republic .
Estimates of the recognised Muslim minority of Greece , which is mostly located in Thrace , range around 100,000 , ( about 1 % of the population ) . Some of the Albanian immigrants to Greece come from a nominally Muslim background , although most are secular in orientation . Following the Greco-Turkish War ( 19191922 ) 19191922 Greco-Turkish War and the 1923 Treaty of Lausanne , Greece and Turkey agreed to a Population exchange between Greece and Turkey . About 500,000 Muslims from Greece , predominantly those defined as Turkish people , but also Greek Muslims like the Vallahades of western Macedonia , were exchanged with approximately 1.5 million Greeks from Turkey . However , many refugees who settled in former Ottoman Muslim villages in Central Macedonia , and were defined as Christian Orthodox Caucasus Greeks , arrived from the former Russian Transcaucasus province of Kars Oblast , after it had been retroceded to Turkey prior to the official population exchange .
Judaism has History of the Jews in Greece in Greece for more than 2,000 years .
The ancient community of Greek Jews are called Romaniote Jews , while the Sephardi Jews were once a prominent community in the city of Thessaloniki , numbering some 80,000 , or more than half of the population , by 1900 . However , after the German occupation of Greece and the Holocaust during World War II , is estimated to number around 5,500 people .
The Catholic Church community is estimated to be around 250,000 of which 50,000 are Greek citizens . Catholic Church in Greece is nominally separate from the smaller Greek Byzantine Catholic Church , which recognises the primacy of the Pope but maintains the liturgy of the Byzantine Rite . Greek Old Calendarists account for 500,000 followers . Protestants , including the Greek Evangelical Church and Free Evangelical Churches , stand at about 30,000 . Other Christian minorities , such as Assemblies of God , International Church of the Foursquare Gospel and various Pentecostalism churches of the Greek Synod of Apostolic Church total about 12,000 members . The independent Free Apostolic Church of Pentecost is the biggest Protestant denomination in Greece with 120 churches . There are no official statistics about Free Apostolic Church of Pentecost , but the Orthodox Church estimates the followers as 20,000 . The Jehovah 's Witnesses report having 28,874 active members .
Since 2017 , Hellenism ( religion ) , or Helenism has been legally recognised as an actively practiced religion in Greece , with estimates of 2,000 active practitioners and an additional 100,000 `` sympathisers '' . Hellenism refers to various religious movements that continue , revive , or reconstruct Ancient Greek religion .
=== Languages ===
The first textual evidence of the Greek language dates back to 15th century BC and the Linear B script which is associated with the Mycenaean Greece . Greek was a widely spoken lingua franca in the Mediterranean world and beyond during Classical Antiquity , and would eventually become the official parlance of the Byzantine Empire .
During the 19th and 20th centuries there was a major dispute known as the Greek language question , on whether the official language of Greece should be the archaic Katharevousa , created in the 19th century and used as the state and scholarly language , or the Dimotiki , the form of the Greek language which evolved naturally from Byzantine Greek language and was the language of the people . The dispute was finally resolved in 1976 , when Dimotiki was made the only official variation of the Greek language , and Katharevousa fell to disuse .
Greece is today relatively homogeneous in linguistic terms , with a large majority of the native population using Greek as their first or only language . Among the Greek-speaking population , speakers of the distinctive Pontic Greek dialect came to Greece from Asia Minor after the Greek genocide and constitute a sizable group . The Cappadocian Greek dialect came to Greece due to the genocide as well , but is endangered and is barely spoken now . Indigenous Greek dialects include the archaic Greek spoken by the Sarakatsani , traditionally transhument mountain shepherds of Greek Macedonia and other parts of Northern Greece . The Tsakonian language , a distinct Greek language deriving from Doric Greek instead of Koine Greek , is still spoken in some villages in the southeastern Peloponnese .
The Muslim minority of Greece in Thrace , which amounts to approximately 0.95 % of the total population , consists of speakers of Turkish language , Bulgarian language ( Pomaks ) and Romani language . Romani is also spoken by Christian Romani people in other parts of the country . Further minority languages have traditionally been spoken by regional population groups in various parts of the country . Their use has decreased radically in the course of the 20th century through assimilation with the Greek-speaking majority .
Today they are only maintained by the older generations and are on the verge of extinction . This goes for the Arvanites , an Albanian language-speaking group mostly located in the rural areas around the capital Athens , and for the Aromanians and Megleno-Romanians , also known as `` Vlachs '' , whose language is closely related to Romanian language and who used to live scattered across several areas of mountainous central Greece . Members of these groups usually identify ethnically as Greek and are today all at least bilingual in Greek .
Near the northern Greek borders there are also some Slavic speakers of Greek Macedonia Slavicspeaking groups , locally known as Slavomacedonian-speaking , most of whose members identify ethnically as Greeks . It is estimated that after the population exchanges of 1923 , Macedonia ( Greece ) had 200,000 to 400,000 Slavic languages speakers . The Jewish community in Greece traditionally spoke Ladino language ( Judeo-Spanish ) , today maintained only by a few thousand speakers . Other notable minority languages include Armenian language , Georgian language , and the Greco-Turkic dialect spoken by the Urums , a community of Caucasus Greeks from the Tsalka region of central Georgia and ethnic Greeks from southeastern Greeks in Ukraine who arrived in mainly Northern Greece as economic migrants in the 1990s .
=== Migration ===
Throughout the 20th century , millions of Greeks migrated to the Greek Americans , Greeks in the United Kingdom , Greek Australians , Greek Canadians , and Greeks in Germany , creating a large Greek diaspora . Net migration started to show positive numbers from the 1970s , but until the beginning of the 1990s , the main influx was that of returning Greek migrants or of Pontic Greeks and others from Greeks in Russia , Greeks in Georgia , Greeks in Turkey the Greeks in the Czech Republic , and elsewhere in the former Soviet Bloc .
A study from the Mediterranean Migration Observatory maintains that the 2001 census recorded 762,191 persons residing in Greece without Greek citizenship , constituting around 7 % of the total population . Of the non-citizen residents , 48,560 were EU or European Free Trade Association nationals and 17,426 were Cypriots with privileged status . The majority come from Eastern European countries : Albania ( 56 % ) , Bulgaria ( 5 % ) and Romania ( 3 % ) , while migrants from the former Soviet Union ( Georgia , Russia , Ukraine , Moldova , etc . ) comprise 10 % of the total . Some of the immigrants from Albania are from the Greeks in Albania centred on the region of Northern Epirus . In addition , the total Albanian national population which includes temporary migrants and undocumented persons is around 600,000.
The Greek census 2011 recorded 9,903,268 Greek citizens ( 91,56 % ) , 480,824 Albanian citizens ( 4,44 % ) , 75,915 Bulgarian citizens ( 0,7 % ) , 46,523 Romanian citizenship ( 0,43 % ) , 34,177 Pakistani citizens ( 0,32 % ) , 27,400 Georgia ( country ) citizens ( 0,25 % ) and 247,090 people had other or unidentified citizenship ( 2,3 % ) . 189,000 people of the total population of Albanian citizens were reported in 2008 as ethnic Greeks from Southern Albania , in the historical region of Northern Epirus .
The greatest cluster of non-EU immigrant population are the larger urban centers , especially the Municipality of Athens , with 132,000 immigrants comprising 17 % of the local population , and then Thessaloniki , with 27,000 immigrants reaching 7 % of the local population . There is also a considerable number of co-ethnics that came from the Greek communities of Albania and the former Soviet Union .
Greece , together with Italy and Spain , is a major entry point for European migrant crisis . Illegal immigrants entering Greece mostly do so from the border with Turkey at the Evros River and the islands of the eastern Aegean across from Turkey ( mainly Lesbos , Chios , Kos , and Samos ) . In 2012 , the majority of illegal immigrants entering Greece came from Afghanistan , followed by Pakistanis and Bangladeshis . In 2015 , arrivals of refugees by sea had increased dramatically mainly due to the ongoing Syrian civil war . There were 856,723 arrivals by sea in Greece , an almost fivefold increase to the same period of 2014 , of which the Syrians represent almost 45 % . The majority of refugees and migrants use Greece as a transit country , while their intended destinations are northern European Nations such as Austria , Germany and Sweden .
=== Education ===
Greeks have a long tradition of valuing and investing in paideia ( education ) , which was upheld as one of the highest societal values in the Greek and Hellenistic world . The first European institution described as a university was founded in fifth-century Constantinople and continued operating in various incarnations until the Fall of Constantinople city 's fall to the Ottomans in 1453 . The University of Constantinople was Christian Europe 's first secular institution of higher learning , and by some measures was the world 's first university .
Compulsory education in Greece comprises primary schools (   , Dimotik Scholeio ) and Gymnasium ( school ) (  ) . Nursery schools (   , Paidiks Stathms ) are popular but not compulsory . Kindergartens (  , Nipiagogeo ) are now compulsory for any child above four years of age . Children start primary school aged six and remain there for six years . Attendance at gymnasia starts at age 12 and lasts for three years .
Greece 's post-compulsory secondary education consists of two school types : unified upper secondary schools (   , Genik Lykei ) and technical schoolvocational school educational schools (     , `` TEE '' ) . Post-compulsory secondary education also includes vocational training institutes (    , `` IEK '' ) which provide a formal but unclassified level of education . As they can accept both Gymnasio ( lower secondary school ) and Lykeio ( upper secondary school ) graduates , these institutes are not classified as offering a particular level of education .
According to the Framework Law ( 3549/2007 ) , Public higher education `` Highest Educational Institutions '' (    , Antata Ekpaideytik Idrmata , ``  '' ) consists of two parallel sectors : the University sector ( Universities , Polytechnics , Fine Arts Schools , the Open University ) and the Technological sector ( Technological Education Institutions ( TEI ) and the School of Pedagogic and Technological Education ) . There are also State Non-University Tertiary Institutes offering vocationally oriented courses of shorter duration ( 2 to 3 years ) which operate under the authority of other Ministries . Students are admitted to these Institutes according to their performance at national level examinations taking place after completion of the third grade of Lykeio . Additionally , students over twenty-two years old may be admitted to the Hellenic Open University through a form of lottery . The National and Capodistrian University of Athens is the oldest university in the eastern Mediterranean .
The Greek education system also provides special kindergartens , primary , and secondary schools for people with special needs or difficulties in learning . There are also specialist gymnasia and high schools offering musical , theological , and physical education .
Seventy-two percent of Greek adults aged 2564 have completed upper secondary education , which is slightly less than the OECD average of 74 percent . The average Greek pupil scored 458 in reading literacy , maths and science in the OECD 's 2015 Programme for International Student Assessment ( PISA ) . This score is lower than the OECD average of 486 . On average , girls outperformed boys by 15 points , much more than the average OECD gap of two points .
=== Healthcare system ===
Greece has universal health care . The system is mixed , combining a national health service with social health insurance ( SHI ) . 2000 World Health Organization report , its [ care system ] ranked 14th in overall performance of 191 countries surveyed . In a 2013 Save the Children report , Greece was ranked the 19th out of 176 countries for the state of mothers and newborn babies . In 2010 , there were 138 hospitals with 31,000 beds , but in 2011 , the Ministry for Health and Social Solidarity ( Greece ) announced plans to decrease the number to 77 hospitals with 36,035 beds to reduce expenses and further enhance healthcare standards . However , as of 2014 , there were 124 public hospitals , of which 106 were general hospitals and 18 specialised hospitals , with a total capacity of about 30,000 beds .
Greece 's healthcare expenditures as a percentage of GDP were 9.6 % in 2007 , just above the OECD average of 9.5 % . By 2015 , spending declined to 8.4 % of GDP ( compared with the EU average of 9.5 % ) , a decline of one-fifth since 2010 . Nevertheless , the country maintains the highest doctor-to-population ratio of any OECD country and the highest doctor-to-patient ratio in the EU .
Life expectancy in Greece is among the highest in the world ; a 2011 OECD report placed it at 80.3 years , above the OECD average of 79.5 , while a more recent 2017 study found life expectancy in 2015 to be 81.1 years , slightly above the EU average of 80.6 . The island of Icaria has the highest percentage of nonagenarians in the world ; approximately 33 % of islanders are 90 or older . Icaria is subsequently classified as a `` Blue Zone '' , a region where people allegedly live longer than average and have lower rates of cancer , heart disease , or other chronic illnesses .
The 2011 OECD report showed that Greece had the largest percentage of adult daily smokers of any of the 34 OECD members . The country 's obesity rate is 18.1 % , which is above the OECD average of 15.1 % , but considerably lower than the United States rate of 27.7 % . In 2008 , Greece had the highest rate of perceived good health in the OECD , at 98.5 % . Infant mortality , with a rate of 3.6 deaths per 1,000 live births , was below the 2007 OECD average of 4.9.
== Culture ==
The culture of Greece has evolved over thousands of years , beginning in Mycenaean Greece and continuing most notably into Classical Greece , through the influence of the Roman Empire and its Greek Eastern continuation , the Eastern Roman or Byzantine Empire . Other cultures and nations , such as the Frankokratia , the Ottoman Empire , the Venetian Republic , the Genoese Republic , and the British Empire have also left their influence on modern Greek culture , although historians credit the Greek War of Independence with revitalising Greece and giving birth to a single , cohesive entity of its multi-faceted culture .
In ancient times , Greece was the birthplace of Western culture . Modern democracies owe a debt to Greek beliefs in government by the people , trial by jury , and equality under the law . The ancient Greeks pioneered in many fields that rely on systematic thought , including biology , geometry , history , philosophy , physics and mathematics . They introduced such important literary forms as epic and lyric poetry , history , tragedy , and comedy . In their pursuit of order and proportion , the Greeks created an ideal of beauty that strongly influenced Western art history . `` Greece , Ancient . '' World Book Advanced . World Book , 2012 .

=== Visual arts ===
Artistic production in Greece began in the prehistoric pre-Greek Cycladic civilization and the Minoan civilization civilizations , both of which were influenced by local traditions and the art of ancient Egypt .
There were several interconnected traditions of painting in ancient Greece . Due to their technical differences , they underwent somewhat differentiated developments . Not all painting techniques are equally well represented in the archaeological record . The most respected form of art , according to authors like Pliny the Elder or Pausanias ( geographer ) , were individual , mobile paintings on wooden boards , technically described as panel paintings . Also , the tradition of wall painting in Greece goes back at least to the Minoan civilization and Mycenaean Greece Bronze Age , with the lavish fresco decoration of sites like Knossos , Tiryns and Mycenae . Much of the figural or architectural sculpture of ancient Greece was painted colourfully . This aspect of Greek stonework is described as polychrome .
Ancient Greek sculpture was composed almost entirely of marble or bronze ; with cast bronze becoming the favoured medium for major works by the early 5th century . Both marble and bronze are easy to form and very durable . Chryselephantine sculptures , used for temple cult images and luxury works , used gold , most often in gold leaf and ivory for all or parts ( faces and hands ) of the figure , and probably gems and other materials , but were much less common , and only fragments have survived . By the early 19th century , the systematic excavation of ancient Greek sites had brought forth a plethora of sculptures with traces of notably multicolored surfaces . It was not until published findings by German archaeologist Vinzenz Brinkmann in the late 20th century , that the painting of ancient Greek sculptures became an established fact .
The art production continued also during the Byzantine era . The most salient feature of this new aesthetic was its `` abstract '' , or anti-naturalistic character . If classical art was marked by the attempt to create representations that mimicked reality as closely as possible , Byzantine art seems to have abandoned this attempt in favour of a more symbolic approach . The Byzantine painting concentrated mainly on icons and [ The Macedonian art ( Byzantine ) ] was the artistic expression of [ [ Macedonian Renaissance , a label sometimes used to describe the period of the Macedonian dynasty of the Byzantine Empire ( 8671056 ) , especially the 10th century , which some scholars have seen as a time of increased interest in classical scholarship and the assimilation of classical motifs into Christian artwork .
Post Byzantine art schools include the Cretan School and Heptanese School ( painting ) . The first artistic movement in the Greek Kingdom can be considered the Greek academic art of the 19th century ( Munich School ) . Notable modern Greek painters include Nikolaos Gyzis , Georgios Jakobides , Theodoros Vryzakis , Nikiforos Lytras , Konstantinos Volanakis , Nikos Engonopoulos and Yannis Tsarouchis , while some notable sculptors are Pavlos Prosalentis , Ioannis Kossos , Leonidas Drosis , Georgios Bonanos and Yannoulis Chalepas .
=== Architecture ===
The architecture of ancient Greece was produced by the ancient Greeks ( Hellenes ) , whose Ancient Greece flourished on the Greek mainland , the Aegean Islands and their Colonies in antiquity , for a period from about 900 BC until the 1st century AD , with the earliest remaining architectural works dating from around 600 BC . The formal vocabulary of ancient Greek architecture , in particular the division of architectural style into three defined orders : the Doric Order , the Ionic Order and the Corinthian Order , was to have profound effect on History of architecture of later periods .
Byzantine architecture is the architecture promoted by the Byzantine Empire , also known as the Eastern Roman Empire , which dominated Greece and the Greek speaking world during the Middle Ages . The empire endured for more than a millennium , dramatically influencing Medieval architecture throughout Europe and the Near East , and becoming the primary progenitor of the Renaissance architecture and Ottoman architecture traditions that followed its collapse .
After the Greek War of Independence , the modern Greek architects tried to combine traditional Greek and Byzantine elements and motives with the western European movements and styles . Patras was the first city of the modern Greek state to develop a city plan . In January 1829 , Stamatis Voulgaris , a Greek engineer of the French army , presented the plan of the new city to the Governor Ioannis Kapodistrias , who approved it . Voulgaris applied the orthogonal rule in the urban complex of Patras .
Two special genres can be considered the Cycladic architecture , featuring white-coloured houses , in the Cyclades and the Epirotic architecture in the region of Epirus . Important is also the influence of the Venetian Gothic architecture in the Ionian islands and the `` Mediterranean style '' of Florestano Di Fausto ( during the years of the fascist regime ) in the Dodecanese .
After the establishment of the Greek Kingdom , the architecture of Athens and other cities was mostly influenced by the Neoclassical architecture . For Athens , the first King of Greece , Otto of Greece , commissioned the architects Stamatios Kleanthis and Eduard Schaubert to design a modern city plan fit for the capital of a state . As for Thessaloniki , after the Great Thessaloniki Fire of 1917 , the government ordered for a new city plan under the supervision of Ernest Hbrard . Other modern Greek architects include Anastasios Metaxas , Lysandros Kaftanzoglou , Panagis Kalkos , Ernst Ziller , Xenophon Paionidis , Dimitris Pikionis and Georges Candilis .
=== Theatre ===
Theatre in its western form was born in Greece . The Polis city-state of Classical Athens , which became a significant cultural , political , and military power during this period , was its centre , where it was institutionalised as part of a festival called the Dionysia , which honoured the god Dionysus . Greek tragedy ( late 6th century BC ) , Ancient Greek comedy ( 486 BC ) , and the satyr play were the three dramatic genres to emerge there .
During the Byzantine period , the theatrical art was heavily declined . According to Marios Ploritis , the only form survived was the folk theatre ( Mimos and Pantomimos ) , despite the hostility of the official state . Later , during the Ottoman period , the main theatrical folk art was the Karagiozis . The renaissance which led to the modern Greek theatre , took place in the Venetian Crete . Significal dramatists include Vitsentzos Kornaros and Georgios Chortatzis .
The modern Greek theatre was born after the Greek War of Independence , in the early 19th century , and initially was influenced by the Heptanesean theatre and melodrama , such as the Italian opera . The Nobile Teatro di San Giacomo di Corf was the first theatre and opera house of modern Greece and the place where the first Greek opera , Spyridon Xyndas ' The Parliamentary Candidate ( based on an exclusively Greek libretto ) was performed . During the late 19th and early 20th century , the Athenian theatre scene was dominated by revues , Musical theatre , operettas and nocturnes and notable playwrights included Spyridon Samaras , Dionysios Lavrangas , Theophrastos Sakellaridis and others .
The National Theatre of Greece was opened in 1900 as Royal Theatre . Notable playwrights of the modern Greek theatre include Gregorios Xenopoulos , Nikos Kazantzakis , Pantelis Horn , Alekos Sakellarios and Iakovos Kambanelis , while notable actors include Cybele Andrianou , Marika Kotopouli , Aimilios Veakis , Orestis Makris , Katina Paxinou , Manos Katrakis and Dimitris Horn . Significant directors include Dimitris Rontiris , Alexis Minotis and Karolos Koun .
=== Literature ===
Greek literature can be divided into three main categories : Ancient , Byzantine and modern Greek literature .
Athens is considered the birthplace of Western literature . At the beginning of Greek literature stand the two monumental works of Homer : the Iliad and the Odyssey . Though dates of composition vary , these works were fixed around 800 ; BC or after . In the classical period many of the genres of western literature became more prominent . Lyrical poetry , odes , pastorals , elegy , epigrams ; dramatic presentations of comedy and tragedy ; [ rhetorical ] treatises , philosophical dialectics , and philosophical treatises all arose in this period . The two major lyrical poets were [ [ Sappho and Pindar . The Classical era also saw the dawn of drama .
Of the hundreds of tragedies written and performed during the classical age , only a limited number of plays by three authors have survived : those of Aeschylus , Sophocles , and Euripides . The surviving plays by Aristophanes are also a treasure trove of comic presentation , while Herodotus and Thucydides are two of the most influential historians in this period . The greatest prose achievement of the 4th century was in philosophy with the works of the three great philosophers .
Byzantine literature refers to literature of the Byzantine Empire written in Attic Greek , Medieval and early Modern Greek , and it is the expression of the intellectual life of the Byzantine Greeks during the Christian Middle Ages . Although popular Byzantine literature and early Modern Greek literature both began in the 11th century , the two are indistinguishable .
Modern Greek literature refers to literature written in common Modern Greek , emerging from late Byzantine times in the 11th century . The Cretan Renaissance poem Erotokritos is undoubtedly the masterpiece of this period of Greek literature . It is a verse Romance ( heroic literature ) written around 1600 by Vitsentzos Kornaros ( 15531613 ) . Later , during the period of Greek enlightenment ( Diafotismos ) , writers such as Adamantios Korais and Rigas Feraios prepared with their works the Greek War of Independence ( 18211830 ) .
Leading figures of modern Greek literature include Dionysios Solomos , Andreas Kalvos , Angelos Sikelianos , Emmanuel Rhoides , Demetrius Vikelas , Kostis Palamas , Penelope Delta , Yannis Ritsos , Alexandros Papadiamantis , Nikos Kazantzakis , Andreas Embeirikos , Kostas Karyotakis , Gregorios Xenopoulos , Constantine P. Cavafy , Nikos Kavvadias , Kostas Varnalis and Kiki Dimoula . Two Greek authors have been awarded the Nobel Prize in Literature : George Seferis in 1963 and Odysseas Elytis in 1979.
=== Philosophy ===
Most western philosophical traditions began in Ancient Greece in the 6th century BC . The first philosophers are called `` Presocratics , '' which designates that they came before Socrates , whose contributions mark a turning point in western thought . The Presocratics were from the western or the eastern colonies of Greece and only fragments of their original writings survive , in some cases merely a single sentence .
A new period of philosophy started with Socrates . Like the Sophists , he rejected entirely the physical speculations in which his predecessors had indulged , and made the thoughts and opinions of people his starting-point . Aspects of Socrates were first united from Plato , who also combined with them many of the principles established by earlier philosophers , and developed the whole of this material into the unity of a comprehensive system .
Aristotle of Stagira , the most important disciple of Plato , shared with his teacher the title of the greatest philosopher of antiquity . But while Plato had sought to elucidate and explain things from the supra-sensual standpoint of the forms , his pupil preferred to start from the facts given us by experience . Except from these three most significant Greek philosophers other known schools of Greek philosophy from other founders during ancient times were Stoicism , Epicureanism , Skepticism and Neoplatonism .
Byzantine philosophy refers to the distinctive philosophical ideas of the philosophers and scholars of the Byzantine Empire , especially between the 8th and 15th centuries . It was characterised by a Christianity world-view , but one which could draw ideas directly from the Greek texts of Plato , Aristotle , and the Neoplatonists .
On the eve of the Fall of Constantinople , Gemistus Pletho tried to restore the use of the term `` Hellene '' and advocated the return to the Olympian Gods of the ancient world . After 1453 a number of Greek scholars in the Renaissance who fled to western Europe contributed to the Renaissance .
In modern period , Modern Greek Enlightenment ( Greek :  , `` enlightenment '' , `` illumination '' ) was the Greek expression of the Age of Enlightenment and its philosophical and political ideas . Some notable representatives were Adamantios Korais , Rigas Feraios and Theophilos Kairis .
Other modern era Greek philosophers or political scientists include Cornelius Castoriadis , Nicos Poulantzas and Christos Yannaras .
=== Music and dances ===
Greek vocal music extends far back into ancient times where mixed-gender choruses performed for entertainment , celebration and spiritual reasons . Instruments during that period included the double-reed aulos and the plucked string instrument , the lyre , especially the special kind called a kithara . Music played an important role in the education system during ancient times . Boys were taught music from the age of six . Later influences from the Roman Empire , Middle East , and the Byzantine Empire also had effect on Greek music .
While the new technique of polyphony was developing in the West , the Eastern Orthodox Church resisted any type of change . Therefore , Byzantine music remained monophonic and without any form of instrumental accompaniment . As a result , and despite certain attempts by certain Greek chanters ( such as Manouel Gazis , Ioannis Plousiadinos or the Cypriot Ieronimos o Tragoudistis ) , Byzantine music was deprived of elements of which in the West encouraged an unimpeded development of art . However , this method which kept music away from polyphony , along with centuries of continuous culture , enabled monophonic music to develop to the greatest heights of perfection . Byzantium presented the monophonic Byzantine chant ; a melodic treasury of inestimable value for its rhythmical variety and expressive power .
Along with the Byzantine ( Church ) chant and music , the Greek people also cultivated the Greek folk music ( Demotiko ) which is divided into two cycles , the Acritic songs and klephtic song . The akritic was created between the 9th and 10th centuries and expressed the life and struggles of the akrites ( frontier guards ) of the Byzantine empire , the most well known being the stories associated with Digenis Acritas . The klephtic cycle came into being between the late Byzantine period and the start of the Greek War of Independence . The klephtic cycle , together with historical songs , paraloghes ( narrative song or ballad ) , love songs , mantinada , wedding songs , songs of exile and dirges express the life of the Greeks . There is a unity between the Greek people 's struggles for freedom , their joys and sorrow and attitudes towards love and death .
The Heptanesean Greek folk music # Ionian Islands (  'serenades ' ; sing . :  ) became the forerunners of the Greek modern urban popular song , influencing its development to a considerable degree . For the first part of the next century , several Greek composers continued to borrow elements from the Heptanesean style . The most successful songs during the period 18701930 were the so-called Athenian serenades , and the songs performed on stage (   'theatrical revue songs ' ) in revue , operettas and nocturnes that were dominating Athens ' theater scene .
Rebetiko , initially a music associated with the lower classes , later ( and especially after the population exchange between Greece and Turkey ) reached greater general acceptance as the rough edges of its overt subcultural character were softened and polished , sometimes to the point of unrecognizability . It was the base of the later lak ( song of the people ) . The leading performers of the genre include Vassilis Tsitsanis , Grigoris Bithikotsis , Stelios Kazantzidis , George Dalaras , Haris Alexiou and Glykeria .
Regarding the classical music , it was through the Ionian islands ( which were under western rule and influence ) that all the major advances of the western European classical music were introduced to mainland Greeks . The region is notable for the birth of the first School of modern Greek classical music ( Ionian School ( music ) , Greek :   ) , established in 1815 . Prominent representatives of this genre include Nikolaos Mantzaros , Spyridon Xyndas , Spyridon Samaras and Pavlos Carrer . Manolis Kalomiris is considered the founder of the Greek National School of Music .
In the 20th century , Greek composers have had a significant impact on the development of avant garde and modern classical music , with figures such as Iannis Xenakis , Nikos Skalkottas , and Dimitri Mitropoulos achieving international prominence . At the same time , composers and musicians such as Mikis Theodorakis , Manos Hatzidakis , Eleni Karaindrou , Vangelis and Demis Roussos garnered an international following for their music , which include famous film scores such as Zorba the Greek , Serpico , Never on Sunday , America America , Eternity and a Day , Chariots of Fire , Blade Runner ( soundtrack ) , among others . Greek American composers known for their film scores include also Yanni and Basil Poledouris . Notable Greek opera singers and classical musicians of the 20th and 21st century include Maria Callas , Nana Mouskouri , Mario Frangoulis , Leonidas Kavakos , Dimitris Sgouros and others .
During the Greek military junta of 196774 , the music of Mikis Theodorakis was banned by the junta and the composer was jailed , internally exiled , and put in a concentration camp , before finally being allowed to leave Greece due to international reaction to his detention . Released during the junta years , Anthrope Agapa , ti Fotia Stamata ( Make Love , Stop the Gunfire ) , by the Pop music group Poll ( band ) is considered the first anti-war protest song in the history of Greek rock . The song was echoing the hippie slogan Make love , not war and was inspired directly by the Vietnam War , becoming a `` smash hit '' in Greece .
Greece participated in the Eurovision Song Contest 35 times after its debut at the Eurovision Song Contest 1974 . In Eurovision Song Contest 2005 , Greece won with the song `` My Number One '' , performed by Greek-Swedish singer Elena Paparizou . The song received 230 points with 10 sets of 12 points from Belgium , Bulgaria , Hungary , the United Kingdom , Turkey , Albania , Cyprus , Serbia & Montenegro , Sweden and Germany and also became a smash hit in different countries and especially in Greece . The Eurovision Song Contest 2006 was held in Athens at the Olympic Indoor Hall of the Athens Olympic Sports Complex in Maroussi , with hosted by Maria Menounos and Sakis Rouvas .
=== Cuisine ===
Greek cuisine is characteristic of the healthy Mediterranean diet , which is epitomised by dishes of Cretan diet . Greek cuisine incorporates fresh ingredients into a variety of local dishes such as moussaka , pastitsio , classic Greek salad , fasolada , spanakopita and souvlaki . Some dishes can be traced back to ancient Greece like skordalia ( a thick pure of walnuts , almonds , crushed garlic and olive oil ) , lentil soup , retsina ( white or ros wine sealed with pine resin ) and Sesame seed candy ( candy bar with sesame seeds baked with honey ) . Throughout Greece people often enjoy eating from small dishes such as meze with various dips such as tzatziki , grilled octopus and small fish , feta cheese , dolmades ( rice , currants and pine kernels wrapped in vine leaves ) , various pulses , olives and cheese . Olive oil is added to almost every dish .
Some sweet desserts include melomakarona , diples and galaktoboureko , and drinks such as ouzo , metaxa and a variety of wines including retsina . Greek cuisine differs widely from different parts of the mainland and from island to island . It uses some flavorings more often than other Mediterranean cuisines : oregano , Mentha , garlic , onion , dill and bay laurel leaves . Other common herbs and spices include basil , thyme and fennel seed . Many Greek recipes , especially in the northern parts of the country , use `` sweet '' spices in combination with meat , for example cinnamon and cloves in stews .
=== Cinema ===
Cinema first appeared in Greece in 1896 , but the first actual cine-theatre was opened in 1907 in Athens . In 1914 the Asty Films Company was founded and the production of long films began . Golfo (  ) , a well known traditional love story , is considered the first Greek feature film , although there were several minor productions such as newscasts before this . In 1931 Orestis Laskos directed Daphnis and Chloe (    ) , containing one of the first nude scene in the history of European cinema ; it was also the first Greek movie which was played abroad . In 1944 Katina Paxinou was honoured with the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress Academy Awards for For Whom the Bell Tolls ( film ) .
The 1950s and early 1960s are considered by many to be a `` golden age '' of Greek cinema . Directors and actors of this era were recognised as important figures in Greece and some gained international acclaim : George Tzavellas , Irene Papas , Melina Mercouri , Mihalis Kakogiannis , Alekos Sakellarios , Nikos Tsiforos , Iakovos Kambanelis , Katina Paxinou , Nikos Koundouros , Ellie Lambeti and others . More than sixty films per year were made , with the majority having film noir elements . Some notable films include The Drunkard ( 1950 film ) ( 1950 , directed by George Tzavellas ) , The Counterfeit Coin ( 1955 , by Giorgos Tzavellas ) ,   ( 1951 , by Grigoris Grigoriou ) , O Drakos ( 1956 , by Nikos Koundouros ) , Stella ( 1955 film ) ( 1955 , directed by Cacoyannis and written by Kampanellis ) , Woe to the Young ( 1961 , by Alekos Sakellarios ) , Glory Sky ( 1962 , by Takis Kanellopoulos ) and The Red Lanterns ( 1963 , by Vasilis Georgiadis )
Cacoyannis also directed Zorba the Greek with Anthony Quinn which received Best Director , Best Adapted Screenplay and Best Film nominations . Finos Film also contributed in this period with movies such as  ,    , Madalena ( film ) , I theia ap ' to Chicago ,       and many more .
During the 1970s and 1980s , Theo Angelopoulos directed a series of notable and appreciated movies . His film Eternity and a Day won the Palme d'Or and the Prize of the Ecumenical Jury at the 1998 Cannes Film Festival .
There are also internationally renowned filmmakers in the Greek diaspora , such as the Greek-French Costa-Gavras and the Greek-Americans Elia Kazan , John Cassavetes and Alexander Payne .
More recently Yorgos Lanthimos ( film and stage director , producer , and screenwriter ) has received four Academy Awards nominations for his work , including Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film for Dogtooth ( film ) ( 2009 ) , Academy Award for Best Original Screenplay for The Lobster ( 2015 ) , and Academy Award for Best Picture and Academy Award for Best Director for The Favourite ( 2018 ) .

=== Mythology ===
The numerous gods of the ancient Greek religion as well as the mythical heroes and events of the ancient Greek epic ( genre ) ( The Odyssey and The Iliad ) and other pieces of art and literature from the time make up what is nowadays colloquially referred to as Greek mythology . Apart from serving a religious function , the mythology of the ancient Greeks world also served a cosmological role as it was meant to try to explain how the world was formed and operated .
The principal gods of the ancient Greek religion were the Dodekatheon , or the Twelve Gods , who lived on the top of Mount Olympus . The most important of all ancient Greek gods was Zeus , the king of the gods , who was married to his sister , Hera . The other Greek gods that made up the Twelve Olympians were Ares , Poseidon , Athena , Demeter , Dionysus , Apollo , Artemis , Aphrodite , Hephaestus , and Hermes . Apart from these twelve gods , Greeks also had a variety of other mystical beliefs , such as nymphs and other magical creatures .
=== Public holidays and festivals ===
According to Greek law , every Sunday of the year is a public holiday . Since the late '70s , Saturday also is a non-school and not working day . In addition , there are four mandatory official public holidays : 25 March ( Greek Independence Day ) , Easter Monday , 15 August ( Dormition of the Mother of God ) , and 25 December ( Christmas ) . 1 May ( Labour Day ) and 28 October ( Ohi Day ) are regulated by law as being optional but it is customary for employees to be given the day off . There are , however , more public holidays celebrated in Greece than are announced by the Ministry of Labour each year as either obligatory or optional . The list of these non-fixed national holidays rarely changes and has not changed in recent decades , giving a total of eleven national holidays each year .
In addition to the national holidays , there are public holidays that are not celebrated nationwide , but only by a specific professional group or a local community . For example , many municipalities have a `` Patron Saint '' parallel to `` Name days in Greece '' , or a `` Liberation Day '' . On such days it is customary for schools to take the day off .
Notable festivals , beyond the religious fests , include Patras Carnival , Athens Festival and various local wine festivals . The city of Thessaloniki is also home of a number of festivals and events . The International Thessaloniki Film Festival is one of the most important film festivals in Southern Europe .

Dominica ( or ; Kalinago language : Wai  tu kubuli ; Dominique ; Dominican Creole French : Dominik ) , officially the Commonwealth of Dominica , is an island country in the Caribbean . The capital , Roseau , is located on the western side of the island . It is geographically situated as part of the Windward Islands chain in the Lesser Antilles archipelago in the Caribbean Sea . The island is located near Guadeloupe to the northwest and Martinique to the south-southeast . Its area is , and the highest point is Morne Diablotins , at in elevation . The population was 71,293 at the 2011 census .
The island was settled by the Arawak arriving from South America in the 5th century . The Kalinago displaced the Arawak by the 15th century . Christopher Columbus is said to have passed the island on Sunday , 3 November , 1493 . It was later colonised by Europeans , predominantly by the French from the 1690s to 1763 . The French imported enslaved people from West Africa to Dominica to work on coffee plantations . Kingdom of Great Britain took possession in 1763 after the Seven Years ' War , and it gradually established English as its official language . The island gained independence as a republic in 1978.
Dominica has been nicknamed the `` Nature Isle of the Caribbean '' for its natural environment . It is the youngest island in the Lesser Antilles , and in fact it is still being formed by Geothermal ( geology ) -volcano activity , as evidenced by the world 's second-largest [ spring ] , called Boiling Lake . The island has lush mountainous rainforests , and it is the home of many rare plants , animals , and bird species . There are xeric areas in some of the western coastal regions , but heavy rainfall occurs inland . The imperial amazon , also known as the imperial amazon and found only on Dominica , is the island 's national bird and featured on the Flag of Dominica , which is one of only two national flags containing the colour purple ( the other being Nicaragua ) . The country is a member of the Commonwealth of Nations , the United Nations , the Organization of American States and the Non-Aligned Movement .
==Etymology==
Dominica 's name is locally pronounced with emphasis on the third syllable , related to its French name of Dominique ( given name ) and the Spanish pronunciation of its name .
== History ==
=== Geologic history ===
Dominica first emerged from the sea during the Oligocene era approximately 26 million years ago , making it one of the last Caribbean islands to be formed by Volcanism .
=== Pre-colonial period and early European contact ===
Dominica 's precolonial indigenous inhabitants were the Island Carib people , who are thought to have driven out the previous Arawak population . The Caribs called the island Wai  tu kubuli , which means `` Tall is her body . ''
Christopher Columbus , sailing for Spain , named the island as Dominica , after the Latin language term dies Dominica for Sunday , the day on which the Spanish first saw it in November 1493 . Some Spanish colonisers settled here . But , as European explorers and settlers entered the region , indigenous refugees from surrounding islands settled Dominica and pushed out the Spanish settlers . The Spanish instead settled other areas that were easier to control and had more natural resources .
=== French colony ===
Spain had little success in colonising Dominica . In 1632 , the French Compagnie des les de l'Amrique claimed it and other `` Petites Antilles '' for Kingdom of France , but no physical occupation took place . Between 1642 and 1650 , French missionary Raymond Breton became the first regular European visitor to the island .
In 1660 , the French and English agreed that Dominica and Saint Vincent ( island ) St. Vincent should not be settled , but instead left to the Carib as neutral territory . But its natural resources attracted expeditions of English and French foresters , who began harvesting timber . In 1690 , the French established their first permanent settlements . French woodcutters from Martinique and Guadeloupe began to set up timber camps to supply the French islands with wood , and they gradually became permanent settlers . They brought the first enslaved Africans from West Africa to Dominique , as they called it in French .
In 1715 , a revolt of `` poor white '' smallholders in the north of Martinique , known as La Gaoul , caused settlers to migrate to southern Dominique , where they set up smallholdings . Meanwhile , French families and others from Guadeloupe settled in the north . In 1727 , the first French commander , M. Le Grand , took charge of the island with a basic French government . Dominique formally became a colony of France , and the island was divided into districts or `` quarters '' . The French had already developed plantation agriculture on Martinique and Guadeloupe , where they cultivated sugarcane with enslaved African workers . In Dominique they gradually developed coffee plantations . They imported so many African slaves to fill the labour demands that the population became predominantly African in ethnicity .
In 1761 , during the Seven Years ' War in Europe , a British expedition against Dominica led by Andrew Rollo , 5th Lord Rollo conquered the island , along with several other Caribbean islands . In 1763 , France had lost the war and ceded the island to Great Britain under the Treaty of Paris ( 1763 ) . The same year , the British established a legislative assembly , with only European colonists represented . French remained the official language , but Antillean Creole , which had developed from it , was spoken by most of the population .
In 1778 the French , with the active co-operation of the population , began the Invasion of Dominica ( 1778 ) re-capture of Dominica . This was ended by the Treaty of Paris ( 1783 ) , which returned the island to British control . But the island population , especially the class of gens de couleur , resisted British restrictions . The British retained control through French invasions in 1795 and 1805 , the first taking place during the period of the Haitian Revolution , which gained the independence of Haiti ( formerly Saint-Domingue , France 's richest Caribbean colony ) .
=== British colony ===
Great Britain established a small colony in 1805 . It used Dominica as part of the triangular trade , by which slaves were imported and sold as labour in the islands as part of a trade that included producing and shipping sugar and coffee as commodity crops to Europe . The best documented slave plantation on the island is Hillsborough Estate , which had 71 male and 68 female slaves . The Quarry Bank Mill family were notable : Thomas Hodgson , a brother-in-law , owned a slave ship , and Thomas Greg and his son John Greg were part-owners of sugar plantations on Dominica . In January 1814 , 20 slaves absconded from Hillsborough . They were recorded as recaptured and punished with 100 lashes applied to the males and 50 for the females . The slaves reportedly said that one of their people had died in the plantation hospital , and they believed he had been poisoned .
In 1831 , reflecting a liberalisation of official British racial attitudes , the Brown Privilege Bill conferred political and social rights on free blacks ( mostly free people of colour , who generally were of mixed race , with African and European ancestry ) . With the Slavery Abolition Act 1833 , Britain ended the institution of slavery throughout British Empire , except in India .
With freedom came enfranchisement . In 1835 , the first three men of African descent were elected to the legislative assembly of Dominica . Many slaves from the neighbouring French colonial islands of Guadeloupe and Martinique fled to Dominica . In 1838 , Dominica became the first colony of the British West Indies to have an elected legislature controlled by an ethnic African majority . Most of these legislators had been free people of colour and smallholders or merchants before the abolition of slavery . Their economic and social views were different from the interests of the small , wealthy English plantation class . Reacting to a perceived threat to their power , the planters lobbied for more direct British rule .
In 1865 , after much agitation and tension , the colonial office replaced the elective assembly with one made up of one-half members who were elected and one-half who were appointed . Planters , who were allied with colonial administrators , outmanoeuvred the elected legislators on many occasions . In 1871 , Dominica became part of the British Leeward Islands . The political power of the ethnic African population progressively eroded . Crown colony government was re-established in 1896 . All political rights were curtailed for people of colour and blacks , who were the overwhelming majority of the population . Development aid , offered as compensation for disfranchisement , resulted in negligible improvements in conditions for most ethnic Africans .
=== Early 20th century ===
In World War I , many Dominicans , mainly the sons of small farmers , volunteered to fight in Europe for the British Empire . After the war , an upsurge of political consciousness throughout the Caribbean led to the formation of the List of historical autonomist and secessionist movements # British West Indies . Marshaling public frustration with the lack of a voice in governing Dominica , this group won one-third of the popularly elected seats of the legislative assembly in 1924 , and one-half in 1936 . In 1940 , administration of Dominica was transferred from the British Leeward Islands to the British Windward Islands . During World War II , some Dominicans volunteered in British and Caribbean forces . Thousands of Free French refugees from Martinique and Guadeloupe escaped to Dominica from the Vichy France-controlled French islands , staying in Roseau and other villages .
Until 1958 , Dominica was governed as part of the British Windward Islands . Caribbean islands sought independence from 1958 to 1962 , and Dominica became a province of the short-lived West Indies Federation in 1958 . After the federation dissolved in 1962 , Dominica became an associated state of the United Kingdom in 1967 , and formally took responsibility for its internal affairs . On 3 November 1978 , the Commonwealth of Dominica was granted independence as a republic , led by Prime Minister Patrick John .
===Post-independence===
In mid-1979 , political discontent with Founding Prime Minister Patrick John 's administration climaxed in a civilian coup and ended in the passage of a Motion of No Confidence in the House of Assembly , Dominica 's legislature , against John , collapsing the John administration . A new , so-called `` Interim Government '' was formed under Dominica 's second Prime Minister Oliver Seraphin ; Seraphin 's main task was to prepare the country for fresh general elections constitutionally due in 1980 , hence the unofficial title `` Interim '' Prime Minister . Seraphin organized and led a splinter of the Dominica Labour Party called the Democratic Labour Party into the 1980 general election and lost mainly because his nearly thirteen month-long premiership was dominated by the fallout from Category Five Hurricane David , which caused 56 deaths and untold damage across the island . Hurricane Allen the following year caused further damage . After the 1980 Dominican general election , Seraphin 's government was replaced by one led by the Dominica Freedom Party ( DFP ) under Prime Minister Eugenia Charles ; she was the Caribbean 's first female Prime Minister .
In 1981 , Charles 's government was threatened with two attempted coups . The first was led by Frederick Newton , commander of the Military of Dominica , who organised an attack on the police headquarters in Roseau which resulted in the death of a police officer . Newton and five other soldiers were found guilty in the attack and sentenced to death in 1983 ; the sentences of the five accomplices were later commuted to life in prison , but Newton was executed in 1986 . A second occurred later in the year when the country was threatened with a takeover by mercenaries in Operation Red Dog , led by Mike Perdue and Wolfgang Droege . They tried to overthrow Charles as Prime Minister and reinstall ex-Prime Minister John in exchange for control over the country 's development . The Federal Bureau of Investigation was tipped off , and the ship hired to transport the mercenaries never left dock . The mercenaries lacked formal military experience or training , and most of the crew had been misled into joining by the ringleader Mike Perdue . White supremacy Don Black ( white nationalist ) was also jailed for his part in the attempted coup , which violated US Neutrality Act of 1794 laws .
The Charles government supported the 1983 American Invasion of Grenada , earning Dominica praise from the Reagan administration and an increase in financial aid .
By the middle of the 1980s , the economy had begun to recover , before weakening again due to a decrease in banana prices . Eugenia Charles won the 1985 Dominican general election general election , becoming only the first incumbent Dominica Prime Minister to be popularly re-elected . The continuing downturn in the economy and the tight grip by Eugenia Charles on Dominica politics gave rise to a self-titled `` Third Force '' political formation in 1988 , which disrupted the traditional two-party arrangement of governing DFP and opposition DLP . `` Third Force '' soon formalized as United Workers Party and selected as its leader Edison James , the former General Manager of the Dominica Banana Marketing Company . This was a strategic selection given James 's prestige among banana farmers and his originating from the East or Atlantic Coast that had begun to feel alienated by the West or Caribbean Sea Coast elites in Roseau , Dominica 's capital . Eugenia Charles again won the 1990 Dominican general election general election , the first incumbent Dominica Prime Minister to win three consecutive general elections . However , Eugenia Charles 's DFP had been pushed to within one seat of losing its majority in Parliament by the emergence of the UWP . It was , therefore , no great surprise when Eugenia Charles gave up political leadership of the Dominica Freedom Party in 1993 and did not contest the 1995 general election in any capacity . No longer benefiting from the veteran charismatic leadership of Prime Minister Eugenia Charles , the Dominica Freedom Party lost the 1995 Dominican general election to the United Workers ' Party ( Dominica ) United Workers ' Party ( UWP ) , whose leader Edison James became Prime Minister . James , former General Manager of the Dominica Banana Marketing Company attempted to diversify the Dominican economy away from over-reliance on bananas . The crop was largely destroyed by Hurricane Luis in 1995 . Further James was unable to restore banana to its former selling price and prestige . Moreover , the James administration became embroiled in Opposition charges of official corruption .
In the 2000 Dominican general election 31 January , 2000 general election , the UWP were defeated by a coalition of the DLP , led by left-leaning Rosie Douglas Roosevelt B . `` Rosie '' Douglas and the Dominica Freedom Party led by former trade union leader , Charles Savarin . Douglas became Prime Minister . One UWP member of the House of Assembly crossed the floor , joining the DLP-DFP coalition government . However , Douglas died on 1 October , 2000 after only a few months . Prime Minister Douglas was replaced by Pierre Charles ( Dominican politician ) , who also died in office on 6 January , 2004 . Roosevelt Skerrit , also of the DLP , replaced Pierre Charles as Prime Minister , becoming the world 's youngest head of government at thirty-one . Under Skerrit 's leadership , the DLP won 2005 Dominican general election that gave the party 12 seats in the 21-seat Parliament , to the UWP 's 8 seats . An independent candidate affiliated with the DLP won a seat as well . Later , the independent candidate joined the government . With his 2005 election win , Skerrit became only the second incumbent Prime Minister of seven to be popularly re-elected .
In the 2009 Dominican general election , the DLP won 18 of 21 seats . The UWP claimed campaign improprieties and embarked on a wide range of protest actions , including boycott of Parliament . UWP 's boycott lasted at least three unauthorized absences from Parliament for two of their three Elected Representatives in Parliament in violation of Parliamentary procedure , leading to their two seats being declared vacant and by-elections being called to fill them ; by-elections were conducted for those two vacant seats in July 2010 , and the UWP again won both seats . The DLP under Skerrit went on to win the 2014 Dominican general election .
On 17 September , 2012 Eliud Williams was sworn in as President ( a largely ceremonial role ) , replacing Nicholas Liverpool Dr. Nicholas Liverpool who was reportedly removed from office due to ill health . On 30 September , 2013 former Trade Union leader and former Dominica Freedom Party leader Charles Savarin was elected president having only days before resigned as a Minister of Government .
Tropical Storm Erika devastated the island in August 2015 , killing 30 and causing severe environmental and economic damage Dominica was again struck on 18 September , 2017 , suffering a direct landfall from Category 5 Hurricane Maria . Early estimates of damage suggested 90 % of the buildings on the island had been destroyed , with infrastructure left in ruins . The UK , France and the Netherlands set up shipping and air lifts to take aid to the island ; the scale of destruction having left most people homeless .
In December 2019 , incumbent Prime Minister Roosevelt Skerrit won his fourth consecutive general election eighteen seats to three , becoming the first Dominica Prime Minister ever to do so .
== Geography and climate ==
Dominica is an island nation in the Caribbean Sea , the northernmost of the Windward Islands ( though it is sometimes considered the southernmost of the Leeward Islands ) . The size of the country is about and it is about 29 miles ( 47 ; km ) long and 16 miles ( 26 ; km ) wide .
Known as `` The Nature Island of the Caribbean '' due to its lush scenery and varied flora and fauna , Dominica is largely covered by rainforest and is home to the world 's second-largest [ spring ] , Boiling Lake . Within its borders lie two ecoregions : Windward Islands moist forests and Windward Islands xeric scrub . The most mountainous of the Lesser Antilles , its volcanic peaks are cones of lava craters , the largest of these being ( north-to-south ) Morne aux Diables , Morne Diablotins ( the highest on the island at 1,447 m ) , Morne Trois Pitons and Morne Anglais . Morne Trois Pitons National Park is a tropical forest blended with volcanic features ; it was recognised as a World Heritage Site on 4 April , 1995 , a distinction it shares with four other Caribbean islands . The Calibishie area in the country 's northeast has sandy beaches . Some plants and animals thought to be extinct on surrounding islands can still be found in Dominica 's forests . The island has several protected areas , including List of national parks of Dominica , as well as 365 rivers . For a few years the government sought to encourage the island as an ecotourism destination , although the hurricane of 2017 has since changed these plans . The country had a 2018 Forest Landscape Integrity Index mean score of 1.06/10 , ranking it 166th globally out of 172 countries .
There are two primary population centres : the capital Roseau ( with 14,725 inhabitants in 2011 ) and Portsmouth , Dominica ( with 4,167 inhabitants in 2011 ) . The main centres tend to be located around the coast , with the mountainous interior sparsely populated .
Dominica is especially vulnerable to [ as the island is located in what is referred to as the hurricane region . In 1979 , Hurricane David ] struck the island as a Category ; 4 hurricane , causing widespread and extreme damage . On 17 August , 2007 , [ [ Hurricane Dean , a Category ; 1 hurricane at the time , hit the island . A mother and her seven-year-old son died when a landslide caused by the heavy rains crushed their house . In another incident two people were injured when a tree fell on their house . Prime Minister of Dominica Roosevelt Skerrit estimated that 100 to 125 homes were damaged , and that the agricultural sector was extensively damaged , in particular the banana crop . In August 2015 , Tropical Storm Erika caused extensive flooding and landslides across the island . Multiple communities were evacuated and upwards of 30 people were killed . According to a Rapid Damage and Impact Assessment prepared for Dominica by the World Bank , the total damage and losses from the storm were US $ 484.82 million or 90 % of Dominica 's yearly GDP . Category 5 Hurricane Maria struck the island in 2017 and caused losses of approximately US $ 930 million or 226 % of GDP .
===Fauna===
The Imperial amazon ( Amazona imperialis ) is Dominica 's national bird and is endemism to its mountain forests . A related species , the Jaco or red-necked parrot ( A. arausiaca ) , is also a Dominican endemic . Both birds are rare and protected , though some forest is still threatened by logging in addition to the long-standing threat of hurricanes .
Dominica is home to 195 species of birds , because of the isolated location of Dominica this is a lesser number compared to Trinidad which is located closer to mainland South-America with 472 bird species .
The Caribbean Sea offshore of the island of Dominica is home to many cetaceans . Most notably a group of sperm whales live in this area year-round . Other cetaceans commonly seen in the area include spinner dolphins , pantropical spotted dolphins and bottlenose dolphins . Less commonly seen animals include killer whales , false killer whales , pygmy sperm whales , dwarf sperm whales , Risso 's dolphins , common dolphins , Atlantic spotted dolphins , [ whales ] and Bryde 's whales . This makes Dominica a destination for tourists interested in whale-watching .
===Territorial disputes===
The Commonwealth of Dominica is engaged in a long-running dispute with Venezuela over Venezuela 's territorial claims to the sea surrounding Isla Aves ( literally Bird Island , but in fact called 'Bird Rock ' by Dominican authorities ) , a tiny islet located west of the island of Dominica .
== Government==
Dominica is a parliamentary democracy within the Commonwealth of Nations . The capital is Roseau . The Commonwealth of Dominica is one of the Caribbean 's few republics . The president is the [ of state ] , while executive power rests with the Cabinet ( government ) , headed by the prime minister .

Unlike other former British colonies in the region , Dominica was never a Commonwealth realm , instead becoming a republic on independence . Dominica is a full and participating member of the Caribbean Community Caribbean Community ( CARICOM ) and the Organisation of Eastern Caribbean States ( OECS ) .
Dominica is also a member of the International Criminal Court , with a Bilateral Immunity Agreement of protection with the US military , as covered under Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court . In January 2008 , Dominica joined the Bolivarian Alternative for the Americas .

== Economy ==
Dominica 's currency is the East Caribbean Dollar . In 2008 , Dominica had one of the lowest per capita gross domestic product ( GDP ) rates of Eastern Caribbean states . The country nearly had a financial crisis in 2003 and 2004 , but Dominica 's economy grew by 3.5 % in 2005 and 4.0 % in 2006 , following a decade of poor performance . Growth in 2006 was attributed to gains in tourism , construction , offshore and other services , and some sub-sectors of the banana industry . Around this time the International Monetary Fund ( IMF ) praised the Government of Dominica for its successful macroeconomic reforms , but also pointed out remaining challenges , including the need for further reductions in public debt , increased financial sector regulation , and market diversification .
Agriculture and especially bananas once dominated Dominica 's economy , and nearly one-third of the labour force worked in agriculture in the early 2000s . This sector , however , is highly vulnerable to weather conditions and to external events affecting commodity prices . In 2007 , Hurricane Dean caused significant damage to the agricultural sector as well as the country 's infrastructure , especially roads . In response to reduced European Union ( EU ) trade preferences for bananas from the former European colonies after the 2009 WTO decision , the government has diversified the agricultural sector by promoting the production of coffee , patchouli , aloe vera , cut flowers , and exotic fruits such as mango , guava and papaya , while the economy has become increasingly dependent on tourism .
The expected increase of Dominica 's Immigrant investor programs ( CBI ) fees has been suspended with no implementation date in sight , as announced by Prime Minister Roosevelt Skerrit , in the 2016 budget speech .
=== International trade ===
Dominica is a beneficiary of the Caribbean Basin Initiative ( CBI ) that grants duty-free entry into the United States for many goods . Dominica also belongs to the predominantly English-speaking Caribbean Community ( CARICOM ) , the CARICOM Single Market and Economy ( CSME ) , and the Organisation of Eastern Caribbean States ( OECS ) .
=== Financial services industry ===
The Commonwealth of Dominica is becoming in recent years a major international financial centre . The largest sectors are `` offshore banking , payment processing companies , and general corporate activities '' . Regulation and supervision of the financial services industry is the responsibility of the Financial Service Unit of the Commonwealth of Dominica ( FSU ) under the supervision of the Ministry of Finance . There are a number of service providers . These include global financial institutions including Scotiabank , Royal Bank of Canada , Cathedral Investment Bank , First Caribbean International Bank , and The Interoceanic Bank of the Caribbean .
Starting in the mid-late 1990s , offshore financial centres , such as the Commonwealth of Dominica , came under increasing pressure from the OECD for their allegedly harmful tax regimes , where the OECD wished to prevent low-tax regimes from having an advantage in the global marketplace . The OECD threatened to place the Commonwealth of Dominica and other financial centres on a `` black list '' and impose sanctions against them . However , the Commonwealth of Dominica successfully avoided being placed on the OECD black list by committing to regulatory reform to improve transparency and begin information exchange with OECD member countries about their citizens .
Dominica supposedly offers tax-free status to companies relocating from abroad . It is not known how many companies benefit from the tax-free status because of the strict confidentiality the government enforces , although it is known many Internet businesses and [ fund ] s utilise Dominica for this reason . However , on 12 July , 2012 Dominica signed an agreement with Poland to exchange tax information .
=== Economic immigrants ===
The Commonwealth of Dominica offers an official and legally mandated economic citizenship to those seeking a valid second citizenship . The nationality law of Dominica authorises the government to waive the normal requirement of seven years of legal residence to acquire citizenship in exchange for an investment into their country 's economy . The required contribution for a main applicant starts at US $ 100,000 through the Economic Diversification Fund . Alternatively , since 2014 , applicants can make a US $ 200,000 minimum investment in pre-approved real estate from island exclusive resorts or global brands like Marriott , Kempinski or Hilton . According to officials , the citizenship by investment ( CBI ) programme was an economic and fiscal `` lifeline '' in the aftermath of Tropical Storm Erika in 2015 and Hurricane Maria in 2017 , and its new investment option had become the main source of Foreign Direct Investment into Dominica by early 2016 . Dominican citizens can travel without a visa , or obtain a visa upon entry , to nearly 140 countries and territories , including the United Kingdom and the Schengen Zone . Applying for Dominica citizenship requires interacting with official Government Approved Economic Citizenship Agents as the first step in the application process . This program is currently valued at 16 % of the government 's total revenue .
The government 's management of the economic citizenship programme and an initial perceived lack of transparency in the use of the revenues generated are a frequent topic of heated domestic political controversy . Referring to the opposition , Prime Minister Skerrit in 2016 stated that `` If they can discredit the Citizenship by Investment Program and make Dominica an unattractive place to obtain citizenship , then revenues would fall and the government would not be able to rebuild the country . Or , the government would then have to increase taxes on the people ; making itself unpopular in their sight . '' Since then , the Government of Dominica has improved transparency of CBI funds . According to Prime Minister Skerrit 's 2018-2019 Budget Address , the island 's CBI Programme has helped develop a National Health Insurance pilot that provides Dominican children in critical medical conditions with overseas treatment . Because many residents were displaced by Hurricane Maria 's impact on the small Caribbean island , the government pledged to build 5,000 hurricane-proof homes , of which the first batch of 125 houses were scheduled for occupancy in February 2019 . The CBI Programme has also significantly helped to develop and create jobs in the island 's ecotourism sector . Furthermore , the Skerrit administration set aside EC $ 5m every month for the construction of a new airport .
The Financial Times ' Professional Wealth Management publication ranked Dominica as the world 's best citizenship by investment programme in its annual CBI Index . According to the report , investors choose Dominica 's citizenship because it has the most affordable investment threshold , the application process is straightforward and streamlined , while the security checks each applicant is subjected to remain very strict .
=== Tourism ===
Dominica is mostly volcanic and has few beaches ; therefore , Tourism in Dominica has developed more slowly than on neighbouring islands . Nevertheless , Dominica 's mountains , rainforests , freshwater lakes , hot springs , waterfalls , and diving spots make it an attractive ecotourism destination . Cruise ship stopovers have increased following the development of modern docking and waterfront facilities in Roseau , the capital . Out of 22 Caribbean islands tracked , Dominica had the fewest visitors in 2008 ( 55,800 or 0.3 % of the total ) . This was about half as many as visited Haiti . The volcanic nature of the island has attracted scuba diving .
== Infrastructure ==
=== Air ===
There are two regional airports on the island , but no international airports . Therefore , flying to Dominica requires travelling through San Juan , Puerto Rico or other nearby islands in the Caribbean such as Martinique , Guadeloupe , or Barbados . The primary airport , Douglas-Charles Airport ( DOM ) , is on the northeast coast and is about a 45-minute drive from Portsmouth ( 1 hour from Roseau ) . The second is Canefield Airport ( DCF ) , about 15 minutes from Roseau on the southwest coast . Douglas-Charles Airport is suitable for limited use of commercial jets because of runway length . Douglas-Charles currently has regular service by Air Sunshine , Winair and Seaborne Airlines using twin turboprop aircraft like the ATR ( aircraft manufacturer ) and Saab 340 , as well as Conviasa and Amerijet , which , using Boeing 727 , is the only airline with jet service to the republic . A runway extension and service upgrade project began at Douglas-Charles Airport around 2006 and was finished in 2010 . In March 2013 , airline American Eagle halted flights to the island citing high labour costs .
=== Roads ===
Dominica 's road network runs primarily along the coastline and along river valleys . Major roads are two-lane highways which connect the capital , Roseau , with Portsmouth ( Edward Oliver LeBlanc ) and the Douglas Charles Airport ( Dr. Nicholas Liverpool Highway ) . It takes about 45 minutes to drive from Portsmouth to Roseau . Private minibuses form the major public transport system . These major roads were reconstructed from the early 2010s to 2015 with assistance from the People 's Republic of China and the European Union .
Due to Tropical Storm Erika # Effects in Dominica several road surfaces and bridges were damaged by flooding and landslides , including on the just completed E.O . LeBlanc Highway ( Roseau to Portsmouth ) and Nicholas Liverpool Dr. Nicholas Liverpool Highway ( Pont Cass to Douglas Charles Airport ) . To alleviate this , the government announced that it intended to install emergency bridges in Roseau Valley near the Trafalgar Falls to Wotten Waven and in Emshall . Hurricane Maria # Dominica also damaged the road network .
=== Green energy ===
Dominica 's electricity sector includes power from hydroelectricity , solar energy , and geothermal energy . Following on from the devastation caused by Hurricane Maria in September 2017 , the Dominican government claimed it would invest in geothermal energy . In early March 2018 Dominica signed an International Solar Alliance Framework Agreement , in an attempt to exploit solar energy to power the country with a source of renewable energy .
== Demographics ==
The vast majority of Dominicans are of African descent . There is a growing mixed population along with a small European origin minority ( descendants of French and British colonists along with some people of Irish descent from indentured servants ) and there are small numbers of Lebanese , Syrians and Asians . Dominica is also the only Eastern Caribbean island that still has a population of pre-Columbian native Kalinago ( previously called Caribs ) , who were exterminated or driven from neighbouring islands . there are more than 3,000 Kalinago remaining . They live in eight villages on the east coast of Dominica . This special Carib Territory ( now Kalinago Territory ) was granted by the British Crown in 1903.
The population growth rate of Dominica is very low , due primarily to emigration to other countries . In the early 21st century , emigrant numbers for the most popular countries are as follows : the United States ( 8,560 ) , the United Kingdom ( 6,739 ) , Canada ( 605 ) , and France ( 394 ) .
Dominica had a relatively large number of centenarians . In March 2007 there were 22 centenarians out of the island 's 70,000 inhabitants three times the average incidence of centenarianism in developed countries . The reasons for this were once the subject of a study that formerly had been undertaken at Ross University School of Medicine .
Dominica was partially integrated into the federal colony of the Leeward Islands in 1832 . Later , in 1871 , it became a full part of the Federation of the Leeward Islands . From the start it was a peculiar relationship for previously Dominica had played no part in the political or cultural traditions of the other more Anglophone islands of the federation . Now , as a Leeward Island , this much larger territory , with thousands of acres of forested unclaimed land , was open to the people of Montserrat and Antigua . At the beginning of the 20th century , the Rose 's Company , which produced Rose 's lime juice , saw demand for its product outgrow its ability to supply the product from Montserrat . Their response to the situation was to buy land on Dominica and encourage Montserrat farm labourers to relocate . As a result , there came to be two linguistic communities in Dominica , Wesley , Dominica and Marigot , Dominica .
In 1902 , on 8 May , the Mount Pele volcano on Martinique erupted destroying the city of Saint-Pierre , Martinique Saint-Pierre . Refugees from Martinique arrived in boats to the southern villages of Dominica and some remained permanently on the island .
=== Languages ===
English language is the official language of Dominica and is universally spoken and understood . In addition , Dominican Creole , an Antillean Creole based on French language , is widely spoken . This is due to French migration to the island starting in 1690 , a majority French Creole speaking population that resided on the island , and its location between the two French-speaking departments of Martinique and Guadeloupe . Since 1979 , Dominica has been a member of La Francophonie . Dominican Creole is particularly used among the older generation , which also speaks a patois language . Because of a decline in the use of Creole by the younger generation , initiatives have been set up in an effort to increase usage and promote this unique part of the nation 's history and culture .
Along with Creole , a dialect known as Kokoy ( or Cockoy ) is spoken . It is a type of List of English-based pidgins which is a mix of Leeward Island English Creole and Dominican Creole , and is mainly spoken in the north-eastern villages of Marigot and Wesley , by the descendants of immigrants from Montserrat and Antigua . Over time there has been much intermarrying , but there are still traces of difference in origin . As a result of this mixture of languages and heritage , Dominica is a member of both the French-speaking Francophonie and the English-speaking Commonwealth of Nations .
Island Carib language , also known as Igneri ( Ieri , Igeri , Inyeri ) , was an Arawakan language historically spoken by the Island Caribs of the Lesser Antilles in the Caribbean . The Island Caribs lived throughout the southern Lesser Antilles such as Dominica , Saint Vincent and the Grenadines and Trinidad and Tobago , supposedly having conquered them from their previous inhabitants , the Igneri . Island Carib became extinct about 1920 , but an offshoot survives as Garifuna language , primarily in Central America .
=== Religion ===
61.4 % of the population is Roman Catholic , though in recent years a number of Protestant churches have been established . About 1012 % of the population belongs to one of the Seventh-day Adventist theology Seventh-Day ( Saturday ) denominations , which includes Yahweh Congregation , Church of God ( Seventh-Day ) , and the Seventh-day Adventist Church .
According to the Association of Religion Data Archives , in 2010 the World Christian Database reported that the largest non-Christian religious groups included : spiritualism followed by 2.6 % of the population ; Bah Faith followed by 1.7 % ; Agnosticism followed by 0.5 % ; Buddhism , Hinduism , and Islam , each followed by 0.1 % ; and Chinese folk religion , Neoreligions , and Atheism each followed by non-negligible proportions ( i.e. , < 0.1 % ) of the population . The nation 's first mosque was built near Ross University .
=== Education ===
School in Dominica is mandatory up to secondary school . After pre-school , pupils attend primary school for six or seven years , and are admitted into secondary school on the basis of a Common Entrance Exam . After five years the students take the General Certificate of Education ( GCE ) , widely replaced by the current Caribbean Secondary Education Certificate administered by the Caribbean Examination Council ( a 15-member confederation of the Caribbean community ( CARICOM ) . The more advanced version of this examination , CAPE , can be taken upon completion of two years of community college . The island has its own Dominica State College , formerly named Clifton Dupigny Community College . Some Dominicans attend universities in Cuba on scholarships offered by its government ; others go to the University of the West Indies or to universities in the United Kingdom , the United States , or other countries .
Archbold Tropical Research and Education Center , a biological field station owned by Clemson University , is located at Springfield Estate between Canefield and Pont Cass . In 2006 All Saints University School of Medicine opened in temporary facilities in Loubire , it was later located in Roseau , Dominica . A marine biology institute in Mahaut , Dominica , the Institute for Tropical Marine Ecology , closed in 2009.
Ross University School of Medicine was located at Portsmouth , Dominica . Ross had been operating in Dominica since the 1980s . There used to be a thousand medical students arriving annually from the United States and Canada who studied at Ross University , but the campus was permanently relocated to Barbados at the beginning of the 2019 Spring semester due to extensive hurricane damage suffered at the Dominican campus .
The Dominica Library and Information Service serves an integral role in the education of the citizens of the country . The creation of a public library in Dominica did not come easily though the impetus was a noble one that would help `` the coloured people ... [ improve ] their lot as they moved along the path to complete freedom ...  ( Borom , 203 ) . The Dominican library began as a reading room that would evolve into a free and public library that was n't fully free : patrons were required to pay a subscription fee . Surviving religious and political discord , the great depression , and two world wars , the library finally came under the care of the government where funds were set aside for its upkeep . Ironically , the early stages of the library 's history were dedicated to remove the `` uncouth '' , and `` barbarous patois '' , which today is being preserved . However , it did achieve its goal of `` diminishing the island  s very high percentage of illiteracy '' ( pg . 225 ) . However , the historical library was demolished in the wake on hurricane Maria in 2018 , and slated to be rebuilt with a more modern outlook .
== Culture ==
Dominica is home to a wide range of people . Although it was historically occupied by several native tribes , the Arawak peoples ( Tainos ) and Carib ( Kalinago ) tribes occupied it at the time European settlers reached the island . `` Massacre River ( Dominica ) '' is a name of a river dedicated to the Kalinago Genocide of 1626 by English settlers on St. Kitts -the survivors were forced into exile on Dominica . Both the French and British tried to claim the island and imported slaves from Africa for labour . The remaining Caribs now live on a territory on the east coast of the island . They elect their own chief . This mix of cultures has produced the current culture .
Music and dance are important facets of Dominica 's culture . The annual independence celebrations display a variety of traditional song and dance . Since 1997 , there have also been weeks of Creole festivals , such as `` Creole in the Park '' and the `` World Creole Music Festival '' .
Dominica gained prominence on the international music stage when in 1973 , Gordon Henderson ( musician ) founded the group Exile One and an original musical genre , which he coined `` Cadence-lypso '' . This paved the way for modern Creole music . Other musical genres include `` Jing ping '' and `` Cadence rampa '' . Jing ping features the accordion and is native to the island . Dominica 's music is a mlange of Haitian , Afro-Cuban , African and European traditions . Popular artists over the years include Chubby and the Midnight Groovers , Bells Combo , the Gaylords , Windward Caribbean Kulture , and Triple Kay .
The 11th annual World creole music Festival was held in 2007 , part of the island 's celebration of independence from Great Britain on 3 November . A year-long reunion celebration began in January 2008 , marking 30 years of independence .
Dominica is often seen as a society that is migrating from collectivism to that of individualism . The economy is a developing one that previously depended on agriculture . Signs of collectivism are evident in the small towns and villages which are spread across the island .
The novelist Jean Rhys was born and raised in Dominica . The island is obliquely depicted in her best-known book , Wide Sargasso Sea . Rhys 's friend , the political activist and writer Phyllis Shand Allfrey , set her 1954 novel , The Orchid House ( novel ) , in Dominica .
Much of the Walt Disney Pictures film Pirates of the Caribbean : Dead Man 's Chest ( the second in the series , released in 2006 ) , was shot on location on Dominica ( though in the film it was known as `` Pelegosto '' , a fictional island ) , along with some shooting for the third film in the series , Pirates of the Caribbean : At World 's End At World 's End ( 2007 ) .
=== Cuisine ===
Dominica 's cuisine is similar to that of other Caribbean islands , particularly Jamaica , Saint Lucia and Trinidad and Tobago . Like other Commonwealth Caribbean islands , Dominicans have developed a distinct twist to their cuisine . Breakfast is an important daily meal , typically including saltfish , dried and salted codfish , and `` bakes '' ( fried dough ) . Saltfish and bakes are combined for a fast food snack that can be eaten throughout the day ; vendors on Dominica 's streets sell these snacks to passersby , together with fried chicken , fish and fruit and yogurt `` smoothies '' . Other breakfast meals include cornmeal porridge , which is made with fine cornmeal or polenta , milk or condensed milk , and sugar to sweeten . Traditional British-influenced dishes , such as eggs , bacon and toast , are also popular , as are fried fish and Plantain ( cooking ) .
Common vegetables include Plantain ( cooking ) , tanias ( a root vegetable ) , sweet potatoes , potatoes , rice and peas . Meat and poultry typically eaten include chicken , beef and fish . These are often prepared in stews with onions , carrots , garlic , ginger and herbs . The vegetables and meat are browned to create a rich dark sauce . Popular meals include rice and peas , brown stew chicken , stew beef , fried and stewed fish , and many different types of hearty fish broths and soups . These are filled with dumplings , carrots and ground provisions .
=== Sports ===
Cricket is a popular sport on the island , and Dominica competes in test cricket as part of the West Indies cricket team . In West Indies domestic first-class cricket , Dominica participates as part of the Windward Islands cricket team , although they are often considered a part of the Leeward Islands geographically . This is due to being part of the British Windward Islands colony from 1940 until independence ; its cricket federation remains a part of the Windward Islands Cricket Board of Control .
On 24 October , 2007 , the 8,000-seat Windsor Park ( Dominica ) was completed with a donation of EC $ 33 ; million ( US $ 17 ; million , euro 12 ; million ) from the government of the People 's Republic of China .
Netball , basketball , Rugby football , tennis and association football are gaining popularity as well .
During the 2014 Winter Olympics , a husband and wife team of Gary di Silvestri and Angela Morrone di Silvestri spent US $ 175,000 to register as Dominican citizens and enter the 15 ; km men 's and 10 ; km women 's Cross-country skiing at the 2014 Winter Olympics cross-country skiing events , respectively . Angela did not start her race , and Gary pulled out several hundred meters into his race . To date , they are Dominica 's only Winter Olympic athletes .
Athlete Jrme Romain won the bronze medal at the 1995 World Championships in Athletics 1995 World Championships in Athletics  Men 's triple jump . He also qualified for the finals at the Athletics at the 1996 Summer Olympics  Men 's triple jump ; even though he had to pull out due to injury , his 12th position is the best performance of a Dominican ever at the Olympic Games .
== Media ==
Dominica has two major newspapers , The Sun and The Chronicle ( Dominica ) . There are two national television stations and a few radio stations , including Stations include : ZBC-AM 590 , the first private local radio station is called Radio En Ba Mango 93.5/96.9FM in the Village of Berricoa Grand Bay and is owned by Urban Dangleben , ZGBC-AM 740 , ZGBC-FM 90.7 ( Portsmouth ) , ZGBC-FM 102.1 ( Roseau ) and ZGBC-FM 106.1 ( Marigot ) , Q95 FM , the Dominica Broadcasting Corporation , and Kairi FM .

The Philippines ( ; Pilipinas or Filipinas ) , officially the Republic of the Philippines ( Republika ng Pilipinas ) , is an archipelagic state in Southeast Asia . Situated in the western Pacific Ocean , it consists of about 7,641 islands that are broadly categorized under three main geographical divisions from north to south : Luzon , Visayas , and Mindanao . The capital city of the Philippines is Manila and the most populous city is Quezon City , both within the single urban area of Metro Manila . Bounded by the South China Sea to the west , the Philippine Sea to the east , and the Celebes Sea to the southwest , the Philippines shares maritime borders with Taiwan to the north , Japan to the northeast , Palau to the east , Indonesia to the south , Malaysia and Brunei to the southwest , Vietnam to the west , and China to the northwest .
The Philippines ' position as an List of island countries on the Pacific Ring of Fire and close to the equator makes the country prone to Earthquakes in the Philippines and Typhoons in the Philippines . The country has a variety of natural resources and a globally significant megadiverse countries . The Philippines has an area of around with a population of around 109 ; million people . , it is the List of Asian countries by population 8th-most populated country in Asia and the List of countries and dependencies by population 13th-most populated country in the world . Multiple Ethnic groups in the Philippines and cultures are found throughout the islands .
Negritos , some of the archipelago 's earliest inhabitants , were followed by Models of migration to the Philippines of Austronesian peoples . The arrival of Ferdinand Magellan , a Portuguese Empire explorer leading a fleet for Spain , marked the beginning of Spanish colonization . In 1543 , Spanish explorer Ruy Lpez de Villalobos named the archipelago : es : Filipinas in honor of Philip II of Spain . Spanish settlement , beginning in 1565 , led to the Philippines becoming part of the Spanish Empire for more than 300 years . During this time , Catholicism became the dominant religion , and Manila became the western hub of Spanish treasure fleet trans-Pacific trade . In 1896 , the Philippine Revolution began , which then became entwined with the 1898 SpanishAmerican War . Spain ceded the territory to the United States , while Hong Kong Junta declared the First Philippine Republic . The ensuing PhilippineAmerican War ended with the United States establishing control over the territory , which they maintained until the Philippines campaign ( 19411942 ) of the islands during World War II . Following Philippines campaign ( 19441945 ) , the Philippines became independent in 1946 . Since then , the unitary state sovereign state has often had a tumultuous experience with democracy , which included the overthrow of a dictatorship by the People Power Revolution .
The Philippines is a founding member of the United Nations , World Trade Organization , Association of Southeast Asian Nations , the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation forum , and the East Asia Summit . The Philippines is considered to be an emerging market and a newly industrialized country , which has an economy transitioning from being based on agriculture to being based more on services and manufacturing .
== Etymology ==
Spanish explorer Ruy Lpez de Villalobos , during his expedition in 1542 , named the islands of Leyte and Samar `` Felipinas '' after Philip II of Spain Philip ; II of Spain , then the Prince of Asturias . Eventually the name `` Las Islas Filipinas '' would be used to cover the archipelago 's Spanish possessions . Before Spanish rule was established , other names such as Islas del Poniente ( Islands of the West ) and Magellan 's name for the islands , San Lzaro , were also used by the Spanish to refer to islands in the region .
During the Philippine Revolution , the Revolutionary Government of the Philippines proclaimed the establishment of the Repblica Filipina or the First Philippine Republic . From the period of the SpanishAmerican War ( 1898 ) and the PhilippineAmerican War ( 18991902 ) until the Commonwealth of the Philippines period ( 19351946 ) , American colonial authorities referred to the country as the Philippine Islands , a translation of the Spanish name . The full title of the Republic of the Philippines was included in the 1935 constitution as the name of the future independent state .
== History ==
=== Prehistory ( pre900 ) ===
There is evidence of early [ living in what is now the Philippines as early as 709,000 years ago . A small number of bones from Callao Cave ] potentially represent an otherwise unknown species , [ [ Homo luzonensis , that lived around 50,000 to 67,000 years ago . The oldest modern human remains found on the islands are from the Tabon Caves of Palawan , Uraniumthorium dating U/Th-dated to 47,000  1110,000 years ago . The Tabon Man is presumably a Negrito , who were among the archipelago 's earliest inhabitants , descendants of the first human migrations out of Africa via the coastal route along southern Asia to the now sunken landmasses of Sundaland and Sahul ( continent ) .
The first Austronesians reached the Philippines at around 2200 BC , settling the Batanes Islands and northern Luzon from Taiwan . From there , they rapidly spread downwards to the rest of the islands of the Philippines and Southeast Asia . This population assimilated with the existing Negritos resulting in the modern Filipino ethnic groups which display various ratios of genetic admixture between Austronesian and Negrito groups . Philippine jade artifacts have been found dated to 2000 ; BC , with the lingling-o jade items crafted in Luzon made using raw materials originating from Taiwan . By 1000 ; BC , the inhabitants of the archipelago had developed into four kinds of social groups : hunter-gatherer tribes , warrior societies , highland Plutocracy , and port principalities .
=== Early states ( 9001565 ) ===
The earliest known surviving written record found in the Philippines is the Laguna Copperplate Inscription . By the 1300s , a number of the large coastal settlements had emerged as trading centers , and became the focal point of societal changes . Some polities had exchanges with other states across Asia . Trade with China is believed to have begun during the Tang dynasty , but grew more extensive during the Song dynasty . By the 2nd millennium CE , some Philippine polities were known to have sent trade delegations which participated in the Tributary system enforced by the Chinese imperial court , trading but without direct political or military control . Indian cultural traits , such as linguistic terms and religious practices , began to spread within the Philippines during the 10th century , likely via the Hindu Majapahit empire . By the 15th ; century , Islam was established in the Sulu Archipelago and spread from there .
Polities founded in the Philippines from the 10th16th centuries include Rajahnate of Maynila , Tondo ( historical polity ) , Namayan , Caboloan , Rajahnate of Cebu , Rajahnate of Butuan , Sultanate of Maguindanao , Confederation of sultanates in Lanao , Sultanate of Sulu , and Ma-i . The early polities were typically made up of three-tier social structure : a nobility class , a class of `` freemen '' , and a class of dependent debtor-bondsmen . Among the nobility were leaders called `` Datus , '' responsible for ruling autonomous groups called `` Barangay ( pre-colonial ) '' or `` dulohan '' . When these barangays banded together , either to form a larger settlement or a geographically looser alliance group , the more esteemed among them would be recognized as a `` paramount datu '' , rajah , or sultan which headed the community state . There is little evidence of large-scale violence in the archipelago prior to the 2nd millennium AD , and throughout these periods population density is thought to have been low .
In 1521 , Portuguese explorer Ferdinand Magellan arrived in the area , claimed the islands for Spain , and was then killed at the Battle of Mactan .
=== Colonial rule ( 15651946 ) ===
Colonization began when Spanish explorer Miguel Lpez de Legazpi arrived from Mexico in 1565 . In 1571 , Intramuros became the capital of the Spanish East Indies , which also encompassed Spanish territories in Asia and the Pacific . The Spanish considered their war with the Muslims in Southeast Asia an extension of the Reconquista . The Spanish successfully invaded the different local states by employing the principle of divide and rule .
Spanish rule brought most of what is now the Philippines into a single unified administration . From 1565 to 1821 , the Philippines was governed as part of the Mexico-based New Spain , later administered from Madrid following the Mexican War of Independence . Manila galleons were constructed in Bicol Region and Cavite . Manila was the western hub of the Spanish treasure fleet trans-Pacific trade .
Under Spanish rule , disparate barangays were deliberately Reductions , where Friars in Spanish Philippines were more easily able to convert the inhabitants to Christianity . A national Education in the Philippines during Spanish rule was introduced in 1863.
During its rule , Spain quelled Philippine revolts against Spain , as well as defending against external military challenges . The Philippines was expensive . Battles of La Naval de Manila from the West , in the 17th century , together with conflict with the Muslims in the South nearly bankrupted the colonial treasury . Spanish forces included soldiers from elsewhere in New Spain , many of whom deserted and intermingled with the wider population . Immigration blurred the racial caste system Spain maintained in towns and cities . Administration of the Philippine islands were considered a drain on the economy of Spain , and there were debates about abandoning it or trading it for some other territory . However , this was opposed for a number of reasons , including economic potential , security , and the desire to continue religious conversion in the islands and the surrounding region .
The Philippines survived on an annual subsidy provided by the Spanish Crown , which averaged 250,000 pesos and was usually paid through the provision of 75 tons of silver bullion being sent from the Americas . Financial constraints meant the 200-year-old fortifications in Manila did not see significant change after being first built by the early Spanish colonizers . British occupation of Manila from 1762 to 1764 during the Seven Years ' War , however they were unable to extend their conquest outside of Manila as the Filipinos stayed loyal to the remaining Spanish community outside Manila . Spanish rule was restored through the Treaty of Paris ( 1763 ) . The SpanishMoro conflict lasted for several hundred years . In the last quarter of the 19th century , Spain conquered portions of Mindanao and Jolo , Sulu , and the Moro people Muslims in the Sultanate of Sulu formally recognized Spanish sovereignty .
In the 19th century , Philippine ports opened to world trade and shifts started occurring within Filipino society . The Latin American wars of independence and renewed immigration led to shifts in social identity , with the term Filipino shifting from referring to Peninsulares and Criollo people to a term encompassing all people in the archipelago . This identity shift was driven by wealthy mestizos , for which it developed into a national identity . This was compounded by a Mexican of Filipino descent , Isidoro Montes de Oca , becoming captain-general to the revolutionary leader Vicente Guerrero during the Mexican War of Independence .
Revolutionary sentiments were stoked in 1872 after Gomburza were executed on weak pretences .

As of 2016 , 96 % of Filipino households have an improved source of drinking water , and 92 % of households had sanitary toilet facilities , although connections of these toilet facilities to appropriate sewerage systems remain largely insufficient especially in rural and urban poor communities .
== Culture ==
One of the most visible Spanish influence on Filipino culture is the prevalence of Catlogo Alfabtico de Apellidos among Filipinos ; a Spanish name and surname , however , does not necessarily denote Spanish ancestry . This peculiarity , unique among the people of Asia , came as a result of a colonial edict by Governor-General Narciso Clavera y Zalda , 1st Count of Manila , which ordered the systematic distribution of family names and implementation of Spanish naming customs on the population . The names of many locations are also Spanish , or stem from Spanish roots and origins .
There is a substantial American influence on modern Filipino culture . The common use of the English language is an example of the American impact on Philippine society . It has contributed to the influence of American pop cultural trends . This affinity is seen in Filipinos ' consumption of fast food and American film and music . American global fast-food chain stalwarts have entered the market , but local fast-food chains like Goldilocks Bakeshop and most notably Jollibee , the leading fast-food chain in the country , have emerged and compete successfully against foreign chains .
The Ati-Atihan Festival Ati-Atihan , Moriones Festival and Sinulog List of festivals in the Philippines are among the most well-known .
The culture within Mindanao and the Sulu Archipelago developed separately to that of the rest of the country , due to very limited degree of Spanish influence and greater influence from nearby Islamic regions .
=== Literature ===
Philippine mythology has been handed down primarily through the traditional Philippine folk literature of the Filipino people . Some popular figures from Philippine mythologies are Maria Makiling , Biag ni Lam-Ang Lam-Ang , and the Sarimanok .
Philippine literature comprises works usually written in Filipino , Spanish , or English . Some of the most known were created from the 17th to 19th ; century . Ibong Adarna , for example , is a famous epic about an eponymous magical bird allegedly written by Jos de la Cruz or `` Huseng Sisiw '' . Francisco Balagtas , the poet and playwright who wrote Florante at Laura , is recognized as a preeminent writer in the Tagalog ( Filipino ) language . Jos Rizal wrote the novels Noli Me Tngere ( novel ) ( Touch Me Not ) and El Filibusterismo ( The Filibustering , also known as The Reign of Greed ) .
=== Architecture ===
Spanish architecture has left an imprint in the Philippines in the way many towns were designed around a poblacion or plaza mayor , but many of the buildings bearing its influence were demolished during World War II . Four Philippine baroque churches are included in the list of UNESCO World Heritage Sites : the San Agustin Church , Manila in Manila , Paoay Church in Ilocos Norte , Santa Maria Church ( Santa Mara ) Church in Ilocos Sur , and Miagao Church in Iloilo . Vigan in Ilocos Sur is also known for the many Hispanic-style houses and buildings preserved there .
American rule introduced new architectural styles . This led to the construction of government buildings and Art Deco theaters . During the American period , some semblance of city planning using the architectural designs and master plans by Daniel Burnham was done on the portions of the city of Manila . Part of the Burnham plan was the construction of government buildings that resembled Greek architecture or Neoclassical architecture . In Iloilo City , structures from both the Spanish and American periods can still be seen , especially in Calle Real , Iloilo . Certain areas of the country like Batanes have slight differences as both Spanish and Filipino ways of architecture assimilated differently due to the climate . Limestones were used as a building material , with houses being built to withstand typhoons .
=== Music ===
During the Spanish era Rondalya music , where traditional string orchestra mandolin type instruments were used , was widespread . Kundiman developed in the 1920s and 30 's , and had a renaissance in the postwar period . The American colonial period exposed many Filipinos to US culture and popular forms of music . Rock music was introduced to Filipinos in the 1960s , and developed into Filipino rock , or `` Pinoy rock '' , a term encompassing diverse styles such as pop rock , alternative rock , [ metal music heavy metal ] , punk rock , new wave music , ska , and reggae . Martial law in the 1970s produced several Philippine folk music bands and artists who were at the forefront of political demonstrations . The 1970s also saw the birth of Manila Sound and Original Pilipino Music ( OPM ) . Filipino hip-hop traces its origins back to 1979 , entering the mainstream in 1990 . Recently K-pop has become popular . Karaoke is a popular activity in the country .
=== Dance ===
In general , there are two types of Philippine traditional folk dance . The first one reflects the influence under the Spanish occupation and the other , the country 's profuseness of tribes that offer their own tribal dances . The music that incorporates the former are mostly bandurria-based bands that utilizes 14th string guitars . One example of such type is the Cariosa . A Hispanic Filipino dance , unofficially considered as the `` National Dance of the Philippines '' . Another example is the Tinikling .
In the Modern and Post-Modern time periods , dances may vary from the delicate ballet up to the more street-oriented styles of breakdancing .
=== Values ===
As a general description , the distinct value system of Filipinos is rooted primarily in personal alliance systems , especially those based in kinship , obligation , friendship , religion ( particularly Christianity ) , and commercial relationships .
Filipino values are , for the most part , centered around maintaining social harmony , motivated primarily by the desire to be accepted within a group . The main sanction against diverging from these values are the concepts of `` Hiya '' , roughly translated as ' a sense of shame ' , and `` Amor propio '' or 'self-esteem ' . Social approval , acceptance by a group , and belonging to a group are major concerns . Caring about what others will think , say or do , are strong influences on social behavior among Filipinos .
Other elements of the Filipino value system are optimism about the future , pessimism about present situations and events , concern and care for other people , the existence of friendship and friendliness , the habit of being hospitable , religious nature , respectfulness to self and others , respect for the female members of society , the fear of God , and abhorrence of acts of cheating and thievery .
=== Cuisine ===
Regional variations exist throughout the islands , for example rice is a standard starch in Luzon while cassava is more common in Mindanao . Filipino taste buds tend to favor robust flavors , but the cuisine is not as spicy as those of its neighbors .
Unlike many Asians , most Filipinos do not eat with Chopsticks ; they use Western cutlery . However , possibly due to rice being the primary staple food and the popularity of a large number of stews and main dishes with broth in Filipino cuisine , the main pairing of utensils seen at the Filipino dining table is that of spoon and fork , not knife and fork .
The traditional way of eating with the hands known as kamayan ( using the hand for bringing food to the mouth ) was previously more often seen in the less urbanized areas . However , due to the various Filipino restaurants that introduced Filipino food to people of other nationalities , as well as to Filipino urbanites , kamayan fast became popular . This recent trend also sometimes incorporates the `` Boodle fight '' concept ( as popularized and coined by the Philippine Army ) , wherein banana leaves are used as giant plates on top of which rice portions and Filipino viands are placed all together for a filial , friendly or communal kamayan feasting .
=== Mass media ===
Media in the Philippines uses mainly Filipino and English , though broadcasting has shifted to Filipino . There are large numbers of both List of radio stations in the Philippines and List of newspapers in the Philippines . The top three newspapers by nationwide readership as well as credibility are the Philippine Daily Inquirer , Manila Bulletin , and The Philippine Star . While freedom of the press is protected by the constitution , the country is very dangerous for journalists . The dominant Television in the Philippines networks were ABS-CBN and GMA Network , both being free to air . ABS-CBN , at the time the largest network was shut down following a cease and desist order issued by the National Telecommunications Commission ( Philippines ) on May 5 , 2020 , a day after the ABS-CBN franchise renewal controversy expiration of the network 's franchise . Prior to this move , Duterte accused ABS-CBN of being biased against his administration and vowed to block the renewal of their franchise . However , critics of the Duterte administration , human rights groups , and media unions said the shutdown of ABS-CBN was an attack on press freedom . On July 10 , 2020 , the House of Representatives declined a renewal of ABS-CBN 's TV and radio franchise , voted 7011 .
TV , the Internet , and social media , particularly Facebook , remain the top source of news and information for majority of Filipinos as newspaper readership continues to decline . English broadsheets are popular among executives , professionals and students . Cheaper Tagalog tabloids , which feature crime , sex , gossips and gore , saw a rise in the 1990s , and tend to be popular among the masses , particularly in Manila .
=== Cinema ===
Philippine cinema began at the end of the 19th century , and made up around 20 % of the domestic market during the second half of the 20th century . During the 21st century however , the industry has struggled to compete with larger budget foreign films . Critically acclaimed Philippines films include Himala ( Miracle ) . Moving pictures were first shown in the Philippines on January 1 , 1897 . All films were all in Spanish since Philippine cinema was first introduced during the final years of the Spanish era of the country . Antonio Ramos was the first known movie producer . Meanwhile , Jose Nepomuceno was dubbed as the `` Father of Philippine Movies '' . His work marked the start of the local production of movies . Production companies remained small during the era of silent film , but 1933 saw the emergence of sound films and the arrival of the first significant production company . The postwar 1940s and the 1950s are regarded as a high point for Philippine cinema .
The growing dominance of Hollywood films and the cost of production has severely reduced local filmmaking . Nonetheless , some local films continue to find success .
=== Sports ===
Basketball in the Philippines is played at both amateur and professional levels and is considered to be the most popular sport in the Philippines . In 2010 , Manny Pacquiao was named Edward J. Neil Trophy # 2000s `` Fighter of the Decade '' for the 2000s by the Boxing Writers Association of America . The national Filipino martial arts and sport of the country is Arnis de Mano . Sabong or cockfighting is another popular entertainment especially among Filipino men , and was documented by Magellan 's voyage as a pastime in the kingdom of Taytay .
Beginning in Philippines at the 1924 Summer Olympics , the Philippines has competed in every Summer Olympic Games , except when they participated in the American-led boycott of the 1980 Summer Olympics . The Philippines is also the first Tropical nations at the Winter Olympics to compete at the Winter Olympic Games Philippines at the 1972 Winter Olympics edition .

The Indonesian archipelago has been a valuable region for trade since at least the 7th century when Srivijaya and later Majapahit traded with entities from mainland China and the Indian subcontinent . Local rulers gradually absorbed foreign influences from the early centuries and Hinduism in Indonesia and Buddhism in Indonesia kingdoms flourished . Sunni Islam traders and Sufism scholars brought Islam in Indonesia , while Europeans introduced Christianity in Indonesia through European colonisation of Southeast Asia . Although sometimes interrupted by the Portuguese colonialism in the East Indies , French and British interregnum in the Dutch East Indies , the Dutch East Indies # History were the foremost Dutch Empire for much of their 350-year presence in the archipelago . The concept of `` Indonesia '' as a nation-state Indonesian National Awakening in the early 20th century and the country Proclamation of Indonesian Independence in 1945 .

== Etymology ==
The name Indonesia derives from Ancient Greek words of wikt : Indo- (  ) and nesos (  ) , meaning `` Indian islands '' . The name dates to the 18th century , far predating the formation of independent Indonesia . In 1850 , George Windsor Earl , an English ethnology , proposed the terms Indunesiansand , his preference , Malayunesiansfor the inhabitants of the `` Indian Archipelago or Malay Archipelago '' . In the same publication , one of his students , James Richardson Logan , used Indonesia as a synonym for Indian Archipelago . However , Dutch academics writing in East Indies publications were reluctant to use Indonesia ; they preferred Malay Archipelago ( Maleische Archipel ) ; the Dutch East Indies ( Nederlandsch Oost Indi ) , popularly Indi ; the East ( de Oost ) ; and Insulinde .
After 1900 , Indonesia became more common in academic circles outside the Netherlands , and native nationalist groups adopted it for political expression . Adolf Bastian , of the University of Berlin , popularized the name through his book Indonesien oder die Inseln des Malayischen Archipels , 18841894 italic=yes . The first native scholar to use the name was Ki Hajar Dewantara when in 1913 he established a press bureau in the Netherlands , Indonesisch Pers-bureau .
== History ==
=== Early history ===
Fossilised remains of Homo erectus , popularly known as the `` Java Man '' , suggest the Indonesian archipelago was inhabited two million to 500,000 years ago . Homo sapiens reached the region around 43,000 BCE . Austronesian peoples , who form the majority of the modern population , migrated to Southeast Asia from what is now Taiwan . They arrived in the archipelago around 2,000 BCE and confined the native Melanesians to the far eastern regions as they spread east . Ideal agricultural conditions and the mastering of Paddy field wet-field rice cultivation as early as the eighth century BCE allowed villages , towns , and small kingdoms to flourish by the first century CE . The archipelago 's strategic sea-lane position fostered inter-island and international trade , including with Indian kingdoms and Chinese dynasties , from several centuries BCE . Trade has since fundamentally shaped Indonesian history .
From the seventh century CE , the Srivijaya naval kingdom flourished as a result of trade and the influences of Hinduism and Buddhism . Between the eighth and tenth centuries CE , the agricultural Buddhist Sailendra and Hindu Mataram Kingdom dynasties thrived and declined in inland Java , leaving grand religious monuments such as Sailendra 's Borobudur and Mataram 's Prambanan . The Hindu Majapahit kingdom was founded in eastern Java in the late 13th century , and under Gajah Mada , its influence stretched over much of present-day Indonesia . This period is often referred to as a `` Golden Age '' in Indonesian history .
Spread of Islam in Indonesia in the archipelago dates to the 13th century in northern Sumatra . Other parts of the archipelago gradually adopted Islam , and it was the dominant religion in Java and Sumatra by the end of the 16th century . For the most part , Islam overlaid and mixed with existing cultural and religious influences , which shaped the predominant form of Islam in Indonesia , particularly in Java .
=== Colonial era ===
The first Europeans arrived in the archipelago in 1512 , when Portuguese traders , led by Francisco Serro , Portuguese colonialism in Indonesia the sources of nutmeg , cloves , and Piper cubeba in the Maluku Islands . Dutch and British traders followed . In 1602 , the Dutch established the Dutch East India Company ( VOC ) and became the dominant European power for almost 200 years . The VOC was dissolved in 1800 following bankruptcy , and the Batavian Republic established the Dutch East Indies as a nationalised colony .
For most of the History of Indonesia # Colonial era , Dutch control over the archipelago was tenuous . Dutch forces were engaged continuously in quelling rebellions both on and off Java . The influence of local leaders such as Prince Diponegoro in central Java , Imam Bonjol in central Sumatra , Pattimura in Maluku Islands , and bloody Aceh War 30-year war in Aceh weakened the Dutch and tied up the colonial military forces . Only in the early 20th century did the Dutch dominance extend to what was to become Indonesia 's current boundaries .
The Dutch East Indies campaign and Japanese occupation of the Dutch East Indies during World War II ended Dutch rule and encouraged the previously suppressed independence movement . Two days after the surrender of Japan in August 1945 , Sukarno and Mohammad Hatta , influential nationalist leaders , Proclamation of Indonesian Independence and were appointed president and vice-president respectively .
The Netherlands attempted to re-establish their rule , and Indonesian National Revolution ended in December 1949 when the Dutch formally recognised Indonesian independence in the face of international pressure . Despite extraordinary political , social and sectarian divisions , Indonesians , on the whole , found unity in their fight for independence .
=== Post-World War II ===
As president , Sukarno moved Indonesia from democracy towards authoritarianism and maintained power by balancing the opposing forces of Indonesian National Armed Forces , political Islam , and the increasingly powerful Communist Party of Indonesia ( PKI ) . Tensions between the military and the PKI culminated in 30 September Movement in 1965 . The army , led by Major General Suharto , countered by instigating a Indonesian mass killings of 196566 violent anti-communist purge that killed between 500,000 and one million people . The PKI was blamed for the coup and effectively destroyed . Suharto capitalised on Sukarno 's weakened position , and following a Transition to the New Order drawn-out power play with Sukarno , Suharto was appointed president in March 1968 . His New Order ( Indonesia ) `` New Order '' administration , supported by the United States , encouraged foreign direct investment , which was a crucial factor in the subsequent three decades of substantial economic growth .
Indonesia was the country hardest hit by the 1997 Asian financial crisis . It brought out May 1998 riots of Indonesia # Background with the New Order 's corruption and suppression of political opposition and ultimately ended Suharto 's presidency . In 1999 , East Timor seceded from Indonesia , following its Indonesian invasion of East Timor and a Indonesian occupation of East Timor 25-year occupation that was marked by international condemnation of human rights abuses .
Since 1998 , democratic processes have been strengthened by enhancing regional autonomy and instituting the country 's 2004 Indonesian presidential election . Political , economic and social instability , corruption , and instances of Terrorism in Indonesia ( the deadliest being the 2002 Bali bombings ) remained problems in the 2000s ; however , the economy has performed strongly in the last 15 years . Although relations among the diverse population are mostly harmonious , acute sectarian discontent and violence remain a problem in some areas . A political settlement to an armed separatist conflict in Aceh was achieved in 2005 following the 2004 Indian Ocean earthquake and tsunami that killed 130,000 Indonesians .
== Geography ==
Indonesia lies between latitudes 11th parallel south 11S and 6th parallel north 6N , and longitudes 95th meridian east 95E and 141st meridian east 141E . It is the largest Archipelagic state in the world , extending from east to west and from north to south . The country 's Coordinating Ministry for Maritime and Investments Affairs ( Indonesia ) says Indonesia has 17,504 islands ( with 16,056 registered at the UN ) scattered over both sides of the equator , around 6,000 of which are inhabited . The largest are Java , Sumatra , Borneo ( shared with Brunei and Malaysia ) , Sulawesi , and New Guinea ( shared with Papua New Guinea ) . Indonesia shares land borders with IndonesiaMalaysia border on Borneo and Sebatik Island , IndonesiaPapua New Guinea border on the island of New Guinea , and East TimorIndonesia border on the island of Timor , and maritime borders with Singapore , Malaysia , Vietnam , the Philippines , Palau , and Australia .
At , Puncak Jaya is Indonesia 's highest peak , and Lake Toba in Sumatra is the largest lake , with an area of 1,145 km2 ( 442 sq mi ) . List of rivers of Indonesia Indonesia 's largest rivers are in Kalimantan and New Guinea and include Kapuas River , Barito River , Mamberamo River , Sepik River and Mahakam River . They serve as communication and transport links between the island 's river settlements .
=== Climate ===
Indonesia lies along the equator , and its climate tends to be relatively even year-round . Indonesia has two seasonsa wet season and a dry seasonwith no extremes of summer or winter . For most of Indonesia , the dry season falls between May and October with the wet season between November and April . Indonesia 's climate is almost entirely Tropical climate , dominated by the tropical rainforest climate found in every large island of Indonesia . More cooling climate types do exist in mountainous regions that are above sea level . The oceanic climate ( Kppen Cfb ) prevails in highland areas adjacent to rainforest climates , with reasonably uniform precipitation year-round . In highland areas near the tropical monsoon and tropical savanna climates , the subtropical highland climate ( Kppen Cwb ) is prevalent with a more pronounced dry season .
Some regions , such as Kalimantan and Sumatra , experience only slight differences in rainfall and temperature between the seasons , whereas others , such as Nusa Tenggara , experience far more pronounced differences with droughts in the dry season , and floods in the wet . Rainfall varies across regions , with more in western Sumatra , Java , and the interiors of Kalimantan and Papua , and less in areas closer to Australia , such as Nusa Tenggara , which tend to be dry . The almost uniformly warm waters that constitute 81 % of Indonesia 's area ensure that temperatures on land remain relatively constant . Humidity is quite high , at between 70 and 90 % . Winds are moderate and generally predictable , with monsoons usually blowing in from the south and east in June through October , and from the northwest in November through March . Typhoons and large-scale storms pose little hazard to mariners ; significant dangers come from swift currents in channels , such as the Lombok Strait and Sape Strait straits .
=== Geology ===
Tectonics , Indonesia is highly unstable , making it a site of numerous volcanoes and frequent earthquakes . It lies on the Pacific Ring of Fire where the Indo-Australian Plate and the Pacific Plate are pushed under the Eurasian plate where they melt at about deep . A string of volcanoes runs through Sumatra , Java , Bali and Nusa Tenggara , and then to the Banda Islands of Maluku Islands to northeastern Sulawesi . Of the 400 volcanoes , around 130 are active . Between 1972 and 1991 , there were 29 volcanic eruptions , mostly on Java . Volcanic ash has made agricultural conditions unpredictable in some areas . However , it has also resulted in fertile soils , a factor in historically sustaining high population densities of Java and Bali .
A Toba catastrophe theory at present-day Lake Toba around 70,000 BCE . It is believed to have caused a global volcanic winter and cooling of the climate , and subsequently led to a genetic bottleneck in human evolution , though this is still in debate . The 1815 eruption of Mount Tambora and the 1883 eruption of Krakatoa were among the largest in recorded history . The former caused 92,000 deaths and created an umbrella of volcanic ash which spread and blanketed parts of the archipelago , and made much of the Northern Hemisphere Year Without a Summer . The latter produced the loudest sound in recorded history and caused 36,000 deaths due to the eruption itself and the resulting tsunamis , with significant additional effects around the world years after the event . Recent catastrophic disasters due to seismic activity include the 2004 Indian Ocean earthquake and the 2006 Yogyakarta earthquake .
=== Biodiversity ===
Indonesia 's size , tropical climate , and archipelagic geography support one of the Megadiverse countries world 's highest levels of biodiversity . Its flora and fauna is a mixture of Asian and Australasian realm species . The islands of the Sunda Shelf ( Sumatra , Java , Borneo , and Bali ) were once linked to mainland Asia , and have a wealth of Asian fauna . Large species such as the Sumatran tiger , rhinoceros , orangutan , Asian elephant , and leopard were once abundant as far east as Bali , but numbers and distribution have dwindled drastically . Having been long separated from the continental landmasses , Sulawesi , Nusa Tenggara , and Maluku have developed their unique flora and fauna . Papua was part of the Australian landmass and is home to a Fauna of New Guinea closely related to that of Australia , including over 600 bird species . Forests cover approximately 70 % of the country . However , the forests of the smaller , and more densely populated Java , have largely been removed for human habitation and agriculture .
Indonesia is second only to Australia in terms of total endemic species , with 36 % of its 1,531 species of bird and 39 % of its 515 species of mammal being endemic . Tropical seas surround Indonesia 's of coastline . The country has a range of sea and coastal ecosystems , including list of beaches in Indonesia , dunes , estuaries , mangroves , coral reefs , seagrass beds , coastal mudflats , tidal flats , algal beds , and small island ecosystems . Indonesia is one of Coral Triangle countries with the world 's most enormous diversity of coral reef fish with more than 1,650 species in eastern Indonesia only .
British naturalist Alfred Russel Wallace described a dividing line ( Wallace Line ) between the distribution of Indonesia 's Asian and Australasian species . It runs roughly northsouth along the edge of the Sunda Shelf , between Kalimantan and Sulawesi , and along the deep Lombok Strait , between Lombok and Bali . Flora and fauna on the west of the line are generally Asian , while east from Lombok they are increasingly Australian until the tipping point at the Weber Line . In his 1869 book , The Malay Archipelago , Wallace described numerous species unique to the area . The region of islands between his line and New Guinea is now termed Wallacea .
=== Environment ===
Indonesia 's large and growing population and rapid industrialisation present serious Environmental issues in Indonesia . They are often given a lower priority due to high poverty levels and weak , under-resourced governance . Problems include the destruction of peatlands , Deforestation in Indonesia large-scale illegal deforestation ( causing Southeast Asian haze ) , over-exploitation of marine resources , air pollution , garbage management , and reliable Water supply and sanitation in Indonesia . These issues contribute to Indonesia 's low ranking ( number 116 out of 180 countries ) in the 2020 Environmental Performance Index . The report also indicates that Indonesia 's performance is generally below average in both regional and global context .
Expansion of the palm oil industry requiring significant changes to the natural ecosystems is the one primary factor behind much of Deforestation in Indonesia Indonesia 's deforestation . While it can generate wealth for local communities , it may degrade ecosystems and cause social problems . This situation makes Indonesia the world 's largest forest-based emitter of greenhouse gases . It also threatens the survival of indigenous and endemic species . The International Union for Conservation of Nature ( IUCN ) identified 140 species of mammals as threatened species , and 15 as critically endangered , including the Bali myna , Sumatran orangutan , and Javan rhinoceros .
Several studies consider Indonesia to be at severe risk from the Climate change in Indonesia . These include unreduced emissions resulting in an average temperature rise of around by mid-century , raising the frequency of drought and food shortages ( with an impact on precipitation and the patterns of wet and dry seasons , and thus Indonesia 's agriculture system ) as well as numerous diseases and wildfires . Sea level rise would also threaten the majority of Indonesia 's population who lives in low-lying coastal areas . Impoverished communities would likely be affected the most by climate change .
== Government and politics ==
Indonesia is a republic with a presidential system . Following the Fall of Suharto in 1998 , political and governmental structures have undergone sweeping reforms , with Constitution of Indonesia # Constitutional amendments revamping the executive , legislative and judicial branches . Chief among them is the delegation of power and authority to various regional entities while remaining a unitary state . The President of Indonesia is the [ of state ] and [ of government ] , commander-in-chief of the Indonesian National Armed Forces ( Tentara Nasional Indonesia , TNI ) , and the director of domestic governance , policy-making , and foreign affairs . The president may serve a maximum of two consecutive five-year terms .
The highest representative body at the national level is the People 's Consultative Assembly ( Majelis Permusyawaratan Rakyat , MPR ) . Its main functions are supporting and amending the constitution , inaugurating and impeaching the president , and formalising broad outlines of state policy . The MPR comprises two houses ; the People 's Representative Council ( Dewan Perwakilan Rakyat , DPR ) , with 575 members , and the Regional Representative Council ( Dewan Perwakilan Daerah , DPD ) , with 136 . The DPR passes legislation and monitors the executive branch . Reforms since 1998 have markedly increased its role in national governance , while the DPD is a new chamber for matters of regional management .
Most civil disputes appear before the State Court ( Pengadilan Negeri ) ; appeals are heard before the High Court ( Pengadilan Tinggi ) . The Supreme Court of Indonesia ( Mahkamah Agung ) is the highest level of the judicial branch , and hears final cessation appeals and conducts case reviews . Other courts include the Constitutional Court of Indonesia ( Mahkamah Konstitusi ) that listens to constitutional and political matters and the Religious Court ( Pengadilan Agama ) that deals with codified Islamic Law ( sharia ) cases . Additionally , the Judicial Commission of Indonesia ( Komisi Yudisial ) monitors the performance of judges .
=== Parties and elections ===
Since 1999 , Indonesia has had a multi-party system . In all Elections in Indonesia since the fall of the New Order ( Indonesia ) , no political party has managed to win an overall majority of seats . The Indonesian Democratic Party of Struggle ( PDI-P ) , which secured the most votes in the 2019 Indonesian general election , is the party of the incumbent president , Joko Widodo . Other notable parties include the Golkar ( Golkar ) , the Great Indonesia Movement Party ( Gerindra ) , the Democratic Party ( Indonesia ) , and the Prosperous Justice Party ( PKS ) . The 2019 elections resulted in nine political parties in the DPR , with a Election threshold of 4 % of the national vote . The first general election was held in 1955 to elect members of the DPR and the Constitutional Assembly of Indonesia ( Konstituante ) . At the national level , Indonesians did not elect a president until 2004 . Since then , the president is elected for a five-year term , as are the party-aligned members of the DPR and the non-partisan DPD . Beginning with 2015 Indonesian local elections , elections for governors and mayors have occurred on the same date . In 2014 , the Constitutional Court ruled that legislative and presidential elections are to be held simultaneously , starting in 2019.
=== Administrative divisions ===
Indonesia has several levels of subdivisions . The first level is that of the provinces , with five out of a total of 34 having a Autonomous administrative division . Each has a legislature ( Dewan Perwakilan Rakyat Daerah , DPRD ) and an elected governor . This number has evolved , with the most recent change being the split of North Kalimantan from East Kalimantan in 2012 . The second level is that of the regencies ( List of regencies and cities of Indonesia ) and cities ( List of regencies and cities of Indonesia ) , led by regents ( bupati ) and mayors ( walikota ) respectively and a legislature ( DPRD Kabupaten/Kota ) . The third level is that of the Districts of Indonesia ( kecamatan , distrik in Western New Guinea , or kapanewon and kemantren in Special Region of Yogyakarta ) , and the fourth is of the Villages of Indonesia ( either desa , kelurahan , kampung , nagari in West Sumatra , or gampong in Aceh ) .
The village is the lowest level of government administration . It is divided into several community groups ( rukun warga , RW ) , which are further divided into neighbourhood groups ( rukun tetangga , RT ) . In Java , the village ( desa ) is divided into smaller units called dusun or dukuh ( hamlets ) , which are the same as RW . Following the implementation of regional autonomy measures in 2001 , regencies and cities have become chief administrative units , responsible for providing most government services . The village administration level is the most influential on a citizen 's daily life and handles matters of a village or neighbourhood through an elected village head ( lurah or kepala desa ) .
Aceh , Jakarta , Yogyakarta , Papua ( province ) , and West Papua ( province ) have greater legislative privileges and a higher degree of autonomy from the central government than the other provinces . A conservative Islamic territory , Aceh has the right to create some aspects of an independent legal system implementing sharia . Yogyakarta is the only List of Indonesian monarchies pre-colonial monarchy legally recognised in Indonesia , with the positions of governor and vice governor being prioritised for descendants of the Sultan of Yogyakarta and Pakualaman , respectively . Papua and West Papua are the only provinces where the Indigenous people of New Guinea have privileges in their local government . Jakarta is the only city granted a provincial government due to its position as the capital of Indonesia .
=== Foreign relations ===
Indonesia maintains 132 diplomatic missions abroad , including 95 embassies . The country adheres to what it calls a `` free and active '' foreign policy , seeking a role in regional affairs in proportion to its size and location but avoiding involvement in conflicts among other countries .
Indonesia was a significant battleground during the Cold War . Numerous attempts by the United States and the Soviet Union , and China to some degree , culminated in the 1965 coup attempt and subsequent upheaval that led to a reorientation of foreign policy . Quiet alignment with the Western world while maintaining a non-aligned stance has characterised Indonesia 's foreign policy since then . Today , it maintains close relations with its neighbours and is a founding member of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations ( ASEAN ) and the East Asia Summit . In common with most of the Muslim world , Indonesia does not have diplomatic relations with Israel and has actively supported State of Palestine . However , observers have pointed out that Indonesia has ties with Israel , albeit discreetly .
Indonesia has been Indonesia and the United Nations of the United Nations since 1950 and was a founding member of the Non-Aligned Movement ( NAM ) and the Organisation of Islamic Cooperation ( OIC ) . Indonesia is a signatory to the ASEAN Free Trade Area agreement , the Cairns Group , and the World Trade Organization ( WTO ) , and an occasional member of OPEC . During the IndonesiaMalaysia confrontation , Indonesia withdrew from the UN due to the latter 's election to the United Nations Security Council , although it returned 18 months later . It marked the first time in UN history that a member state had attempted a withdrawal . Indonesia has been a humanitarian and development aid recipient since 1966 , and recently , the country established its first overseas aid program in late 2019.
=== Military ===
Indonesia 's Armed Forces ( TNI ) include the Indonesian Army ( TNIAD ) , Indonesian Navy ( TNIAL , which includes Indonesian Marine Corps ) , and Indonesian Air Force ( TNIAU ) . The army has about 400,000 active-duty personnel . Defence spending in the national budget was 0.7 % of GDP in 2018 , with controversial involvement of military-owned commercial interests and foundations . The Armed Forces were formed during the Indonesian National Revolution when it undertook guerrilla warfare along with informal militia . Since then , territorial lines have formed the basis of all TNI branches ' structure , aimed at maintaining domestic stability and deterring foreign threats . The military has possessed a strong political influence since its founding , which Dwifungsi . Political reforms in 1998 included the removal of the TNI 's formal representation from the legislature . Nevertheless , its political influence remains , albeit at a reduced level .
Since independence , the country has struggled to maintain unity against local insurgencies and separatist movements . Some , notably in Insurgency in Aceh and Papua conflict , have led to an armed conflict , and subsequent allegations of human rights abuses and brutality from all sides . The former was resolved peacefully in 2005 , while the latter continues , amid a significant , albeit imperfect , implementation of regional autonomy laws , and a reported decline in the levels of violence and Human rights in Indonesia # West Papua issues since 2004 . Other engagements of the army include the campaign against the Netherlands New Guinea to incorporate the territory into Indonesia , the IndonesiaMalaysia confrontation to oppose the creation of Malaysia , the Indonesian mass killings of 196566 of PKI , and the Indonesian invasion of East Timor , which remains Indonesia 's most massive military operation .
== Economy ==
Indonesia has a mixed economy in which both the private sector and government play vital roles . As the only G20 member state in Southeast Asia , the country has the largest economy in the region and is classified as a newly industrialised country . , it is the world 's List of countries by GDP ( nominal ) and List of countries by GDP ( PPP ) , estimated to be US $ 1.100 ; trillion and US $ 3.740 ; trillion respectively . Per capita GDP in PPP is US $ 14,020 , while nominal gross domestic product is US $ 4,120 . The debt ratio to GDP is 29.2 % . The services are the economy 's largest sector and account for 43.4 % of GDP ( 2018 ) , followed by industry ( 39.7 % ) and agriculture ( 12.8 % ) . Since 2009 , it has employed more people than other sectors , accounting for 47.7 % of the total labour force , followed by agriculture ( 30.2 % ) and industry ( 21.9 % ) .
Over time , the structure of the economy has changed considerably . Historically , it has been weighted heavily towards agriculture , reflecting both its stage of economic development and government policies in the 1950s and 1960s to promote agricultural self-sufficiency . A gradual process of industrialisation and urbanisation began in the late 1960s and accelerated in the 1980s as falling oil prices saw the government focus on diversifying away from oil exports and towards manufactured exports . This development continued throughout the 1980s and into the next decade despite the 1990 oil price shock , during which the GDP rose at an average rate of 7.1 % . As a result , the official poverty rate fell from 60 % to 15 % . Reduction of trade barriers from the mid-1980s made the economy more globally integrated . The growth ended with the 1997 Asian financial crisis that had a severe impact on the economy , including a 13.1 % real GDP contraction in 1998 and inflation reaching 78 % . The economy reached its low point in mid-1999 with only 0.8 % real GDP growth .
Relatively steady inflation and an increase in GDP deflator and the Consumer Price Index have contributed to strong economic growth in recent years . From 2007 to 2019 , annual growth has accelerated to between 4 % and 6 % as a result of improvement in the banking sector and domestic consumption , helping Indonesia weather the 20082009 Great Recession , and regain in 2011 the investment grade rating it had lost in 1997. , 9.41 % of the population lived below the poverty line , and the official open unemployment rate was 5.28 % . However , in late 2020 , Indonesia fell into its first recession in 22 years due to the effects of the global COVID-19 pandemic .
Indonesia has abundant natural resources like petroleum and natural gas , coal , tin , copper , gold , and nickel , while Agriculture in Indonesia produces rice , palm oil , tea , coffee , cacao bean , medicinal plants , spices , and Natural rubber . These commodities make up a large portion of the country 's exports , with palm oil and coal briquettes as the leading export commodities . In addition to refined and crude petroleum as the main imports , telephones , vehicle parts and wheat cover the majority of additional imports . China , the United States , Japan , Singapore , India , Malaysia , South Korea and Thailand are Indonesia 's principal export markets and import partners .
=== Transport ===
Indonesia 's transport system has been shaped over time by the economic resource base of an archipelago , and the distribution of its 250 ; million people highly concentrated on Java . All transport modes play a role in the country 's transport system and are generally complementary rather than competitive . In 2016 , the transport sector generated about 5.2 % of GDP .
The road transport system is predominant , with a total length of . Jakarta has the TransJakarta , boasting some in 13 corridors and ten cross-corridor routes . Rickshaws such as bajaj and becak and share taxis such as Angkot and Metromini are a regular sight in the country . Most of the railways are in Java , used for both freight and passenger transport , such as local commuter rail services complementing the inter-city rail network in several cities . In the late 2010s , Jakarta and Palembang were the first cities in Indonesia to have rapid transit systems , with more planned for other cities in the future . In 2015 , the government announced a plan to build a High-speed rail in Indonesia high-speed rail , which would be a first in Southeast Asia .
Indonesia 's largest airport , SoekarnoHatta International Airport is among the busiest in the Southern Hemisphere , List of busiest airports by passenger traffic serving 54 ; million passengers in 2019 . Ngurah Rai International Airport and Juanda International Airport are the country 's second-and third-busiest airport respectively . Garuda Indonesia , the country 's flag carrier since 1949 , is one of the world 's leading airlines and a member of the global airline alliance SkyTeam . Port of Tanjung Priok is the busiest and most advanced Indonesian port , handling more than 50 % of Indonesia 's trans-shipment cargo traffic .
=== Energy ===
In 2017 , Indonesia was the world 's 9th largest energy producer with , and the 15th largest energy consumer , with . The country has substantial energy resources , including of conventional oil and gas reserves ( of which about 4 ; billion barrels are recoverable ) , 8 ; billion barrels of oil-equivalent of coal-based methane ( CBM ) resources , and 28 ; billion tonnes of recoverable coal . While reliance on domestic coal and imported oil has increased , Indonesia has seen progress in renewable energy with hydropower being the most abundant source . Furthermore , the country has the potential for geothermal , solar , wind , biomass and ocean energy . Indonesia has set out to achieve 23 % use of renewable energy by 2025 and 31 % by 2050. , Indonesia 's total national installed power generation capacity stands at 55,528.51 MW .
The country 's largest dam , Jatiluhur Dam , has several purposes including the provision of hydroelectric power generation , water supply , flood control , irrigation and aquaculture . The earth-fill dam is high and withholds a reservoir of . It helps to supply water to Jakarta and to irrigate of rice fields and has an installed capacity of 186.5 MW which feeds into the Java grid managed by the State Electricity Company ( Perusahaan Listrik Negara , PLN ) .
=== Science and technology ===
Indonesia 's expenditure on science and technology is relatively low , at less than 0.1 % of GDP ( 2017 ) . Historical examples of scientific and technological developments include the paddy cultivation technique Terrace ( agriculture ) , which is common in Southeast Asia , and the pinisi boats by the Bugis and Makassar people . In the 1980s , Indonesian engineer Tjokorda Raka Sukawati invented a road construction technique named Sosrobahu that allows the construction of long stretches of flyovers above existing main roads with minimum traffic disruption . It later became widely used in several countries . The country is also an active producer of passenger trains and freight wagons with its state-owned company , the Industri Kereta Api ( INKA ) , and has exported trains abroad .
Indonesia has a long history in developing military and small commuter aircraft as the only country in Southeast Asia to build and produce aircraft . With its state-owned company , the Indonesian Aerospace ( PT . Dirgantara Indonesia ) , Indonesia has provided components for Boeing and Airbus . The company also collaborated with EADS CASA of Spain to develop the CASA/IPTN CN-235 CN-235 that has seen use by several countries . Former President B. J. Habibie played a vital role in this achievement . Indonesia has also joined the South Korean programme to manufacture the fifth-generation jet fighter KAI KF-X .
Indonesia has a space programme and space agency , the National Institute of Aeronautics and Space ( Lembaga Penerbangan dan Antariksa Nasional , LAPAN ) . In the 1970s , Indonesia became the first developing country to operate a satellite system called Palapa , a series of communication satellites owned by Indosat Ooredoo . The first satellite , PALAPA A1 was launched on 8 July 1976 from the Kennedy Space Center in Florida , United States . , Indonesia has launched 18 satellites for various purposes , and LAPAN has expressed a desire to put satellites in orbit with native launch vehicles by 2040.
=== Tourism ===
Tourism in Indonesia contributed around US $ 19.7 ; billion to GDP in 2019 . In 2018 , Indonesia received 15.8 ; million visitors , a growth of 12.5 % from last year , and received an average receipt of US $ 967 . China , Singapore , Malaysia , Australia , and Japan are the top five sources of visitors to Indonesia . Since 2011 , Wonderful Indonesia has been the slogan of the country 's international marketing campaign to promote tourism .
Nature and culture are prime attractions of Indonesian tourism . The former can boast a unique combination of a tropical climate , a vast archipelago , and a long stretch of beaches , and the latter complement those with a rich cultural heritage reflecting Indonesia 's dynamic history and ethnic diversity . Indonesia has a well-preserved natural ecosystem with rain forests that stretch over about 57 % of Indonesia 's land ( 225 ; million acres ) . Forests on Sumatra and Kalimantan are examples of popular destinations , such as the Orangutan wildlife reserve . Moreover , Indonesia has one of the world 's longest coastlines , measuring . The ancient Borobudur and Prambanan temples as well as Toraja and Bali , with its traditional festivities , are some of the popular destinations for cultural tourism .
Indonesia has List of World Heritage Sites in Indonesia , including the Komodo National Park and the Ombilin Coal Mine ; and a further 19 in a tentative list that includes Bunaken National Park and Raja Ampat Islands . Other attractions include the specific points in Indonesian history , such as the colonial heritage of the Dutch East Indies in the old towns of Kota Tua Jakarta and Dutch architecture in Semarang , and the List of palaces in Indonesia of Pagaruyung Palace , Ubud Palace , and Kraton Ngayogyakarta Hadiningrat .
== Demographics ==
The 2020 Indonesian census recorded Demographics of Indonesia Indonesia 's population as 270.2 ; million , the List of countries and dependencies by population , with a moderately high population growth rate at 1.3 % . Java is the world 's most populous island , where 56 % of the country 's population lives . The population density is 141 people per km2 ( 365 per sq mi ) , ranking 88th in the world , although Java has a population density of 1,067 people per km2 ( 2,435 per sq mi ) . In 1961 , the first post-colonial census recorded a total of 97 ; million people . It is expected to grow to around 295 ; million by 2030 and 321 ; million by 2050 . The country currently possesses a relatively young population , with a median age of 30.2 years ( 2017 estimate ) .
The spread of the population is uneven throughout the archipelago with a varying habitat and level of List of Indonesian provinces by Human Development Index , ranging from the megacity of Jakarta to Uncontacted peoples in Papua . As of 2017 , about 54.7 % of the population lives in urban areas . Jakarta is the country 's primate city and the List of largest cities second-most populous urban area in the world with over 34 ; million residents . About 8 ; million Overseas Indonesians ; most settled in Malaysia , the Netherlands , Saudi Arabia , the United Arab Emirates , Hong Kong , Singapore , the United States , and Australia .
=== Ethnic groups and languages ===
Indonesia is an ethnically diverse country , with around 600 distinct native ethnic groups . Most Indonesians are descended from Austronesian peoples whose languages had origins in Proto-Austronesian language Proto-Austronesian , which possibly originated in what is now Taiwan . Another major grouping is the Melanesians , who inhabit eastern Indonesia ( the Maluku Islands and Western New Guinea ) .
The Javanese people are the largest ethnic group , constituting 40.2 % of the population , and are politically dominant . They are predominantly located in the central to eastern parts of Java and also sizable numbers in most provinces . The Sundanese people , Malays ( ethnic group ) , Batak people , Madurese people , Minangkabau people and Bugis people are the next largest groups in the country . A sense of Indonesian nationhood exists alongside strong regional identities .
The country 's official language is Indonesian language , a variant of Malay language based on its Prestige ( sociolinguistics ) , which for centuries had been the lingua franca of the archipelago . It was Youth Pledge and achieved official status under the name Bahasa Indonesia in 1945 . As a result of centuries-long contact with other languages , it is rich in local and foreign influences , including from Javanese , Sundanese , Minangkabau , Hindi , Sanskrit , Chinese , Arabic , Dutch , Portuguese and English . Nearly every Indonesian speaks the language due to its widespread use in education , academics , communications , business , politics , and mass media . Most Indonesians also speak at least one of more than 700 local languages , often as their first language . Most belong to the Austronesian languages , while there are over 270 Papuan languages spoken in eastern Indonesia . Of these , Javanese language is the most widely spoken .
In 1930 , Dutch people and other Europeans ( Totok ) , Eurasian ( mixed ancestry ) , and derivative people like the Indo people , numbered 240,000 or 0.4 % of the total population . Historically , they constituted only a tiny fraction of the native population and remain so today . Also , the Dutch language never had a substantial number of speakers or official status despite the Dutch presence for almost 350 years . The small minorities that can speak it or Dutch-based creole languages fluently are the aforementioned ethnic groups and descendants of Dutch colonisers . This reflected the primary purpose of the Dutch colonial empire , which was commercial exchange as opposed to sovereignty over homogeneous landmasses . Today , there is some degree of fluency by either educated members of the oldest generation or legal professionals , as specific law codes are still only available in Dutch .
=== Religion ===
While the constitution stipulates religious freedom , the government officially recognises only Religion in Indonesia : Islam in Indonesia , Protestantism in Indonesia , Roman Catholicism in Indonesia , Hinduism in Indonesia , Buddhism in Indonesia , and Supreme Council for the Confucian Religion in Indonesia ; with indigenous religions only partly acknowledged . Indonesia is the world 's most populous Muslim-majority country with 227 ; million adherents in 2017 , with the majority being Sunni Islam ( 99 % ) . The Shia Islam in Indonesia and Ahmadiyya in Indonesia respectively constitute 1 % ( 13 ; million ) and 0.2 % ( 200,000400,000 ) of the Muslim population . Almost 11 % of Indonesians are Christians , while the rest are Hindus , Buddhists , and others . Most Hindus are Balinese people , and most Buddhism are Chinese Indonesians .
The natives of the Indonesian archipelago originally practised indigenous animism and dynamism ( metaphysics ) , beliefs that are common to Austronesian people . They worshipped and revered ancestral spirit , and believed that supernatural spirits ( [ might inhabit certain places such as large trees , stones , forests , mountains , or sacred sites . Examples of Indonesian native belief systems include the Sundanese people Sundanese ] [ [ Sunda Wiwitan , Dayak people 's Kaharingan , and the Javanese people Kejawn . They have had a significant impact on how other faiths are practised , evidenced by a large proportion of peoplesuch as the Javanese abangan , Balinese Hinduism , and Dayak Christianspractising a less orthodoxy , syncretism form of their religion .
Hinduism in Indonesia influences reached the archipelago as early as the first century CE . The Sundanese people Kingdoms of Sunda of Salakanagara in western Java around 130 was the first historically recorded Greater India kingdom in the archipelago . Buddhism in Indonesia arrived around the 6th century , and its history in Indonesia is closely related to that of Hinduism , as some empires based on Buddhism had its roots around the same period . The archipelago has witnessed the rise and fall of powerful and influential Hindu and Buddhist empires such as Majapahit , Shailendra dynasty , Srivijaya , and Mataram . Though no longer a majority , Hinduism and Buddhism remain to have a substantial influence on Indonesian culture .
Islam in Indonesia was introduced by Sunni Islam traders of the Shafi ' i fiqh , as well as Sufi traders from the Indian subcontinent and southern Arabian peninsula as early as the 8th century CE . For the most part , Islam overlaid and mixed with existing cultural and religious influences that resulted in a distinct form of Islam . Trade , missionary works such as by the Wali Sanga and Chinese explorer Zheng He , and military campaigns by several sultanates helped accelerate the spread of the religion . By the end of the 16th century , Islam had supplanted Hinduism and Buddhism as the dominant religion of Java and Sumatra .
Catholic Church in Indonesia was brought by Portuguese traders and missionaries such as Society of Jesus Francis Xavier , who visited and baptised several thousand locals . Its spread faced difficulty due to the VOC policy of banning the religion and the Dutch hostility due to the Eighty Years ' War against Catholic Spain 's rule . Protestantism in Indonesia is mostly a result of Calvinism and Lutheranism missionary efforts during the Dutch colonial era . Although they are the most common branch , there is a multitude of other denominations elsewhere in the country .
There was a History of the Jews in Indonesia until 1945 , mostly Dutch and some Baghdadi Jews . Since most have left after Indonesia proclaimed independence , Judaism was never accorded official status , and only a tiny number of Jews remain today , mostly in Jakarta and Surabaya . At the national and local level , Indonesia 's political leadership and civil society groups have played a crucial role in interfaith relations , both positively and negatively . The invocation of the first principle of Indonesia 's philosophical foundation , Pancasila ( the belief in the one and only God ) often serves as a reminder of religious tolerance , though instances of intolerance have occurred . An overwhelming majority of Indonesians consider religion to be essential , and its role is present in almost all aspects of society , including politics , education , marriage , and Public holidays in Indonesia .
=== Education and health ===
Education is compulsory for 12 years . Parents can choose between state-run , non-sectarian schools or private or semi-private religious ( usually Islamic ) schools , supervised by the ministries of Education and Religion , respectively . Private international schools that do not follow the Education in Indonesia # 2013 Curriculum are also available . The enrolment rate is 93 % for primary education , 79 % for secondary education , and 36 % for tertiary education ( 2018 ) . The literacy rate is 96 % ( 2018 ) , and the government spends about 3.6 % of GDP ( 2015 ) on education . In 2018 , there were more than 4,500 higher educational institutions in Indonesia , with the top universities ( the University of Indonesia , Bandung Institute of Technology and Gadjah Mada University ) and most others located in Java .
Government expenditure on healthcare is about 3.3 % of GDP in 2016 . As part of an attempt to achieve universal health care , the government launched the National Health Insurance ( Jaminan Kesehatan Nasional , JKN ) in 2014 . It includes coverage for a range of services from the public and also private firms that have opted to join the scheme . In recent decades , there have been remarkable improvements such as rising life expectancy ( from 62.3 years in 1990 to 71.7 years in 2019 ) and declining child mortality ( from 84 deaths per 1,000 births in 1990 to 25.4 deaths in 2017 ) . Nevertheless , Indonesia continues to face challenges that include maternal and child health , low air quality , malnutrition , high rate of smoking , and infectious diseases .
=== Issues ===
Nearly 80 % of Indonesia 's population lives in the western parts of the archipelago , but they are growing at a slower pace than the rest of the country . This situation creates a gap in wealth , unemployment rate , and health between densely populated islands and economic centres ( such as Sumatra and Java ) and sparsely populated , disadvantaged areas ( such as Maluku Islands and Western New Guinea ) . Numerous cases of racism and discrimination , especially Discrimination against Chinese Indonesians and Indigenous people of New Guinea , have been well documented ; the latter has to do with an Free Papua Movement ongoing , decades-long separatist movement . LGBT rights in Indonesia has been relatively obscure . However , in the 2010s ( especially after 2016 ) , a wave of anti-LGBT rhetoric has surged rapidly , putting LGBT Indonesians into a frequent subject of intimidation , discrimination , and even violence .
== Culture ==
The cultural history of the Indonesian archipelago spans more than two millennia . Influences from the Indian subcontinent , mainland China , the Middle East , Europe , and the Austronesian peoples have historically shaped the cultural , linguistic and religious makeup of the archipelago . As a result , modern-day Indonesia has a multicultural , multilingual and multi-ethnic society , with a complex cultural mixture that differs significantly from the original indigenous cultures . Indonesia currently holds UNESCO Intangible Cultural Heritage Lists eleven items of UNESCO 's Intangible Cultural Heritage , including a wayang puppet theatre , kris , batik , pencak silat , angklung , and the three genres of traditional Balinese dance .
=== Art and architecture ===
Indonesian arts include both age-old art forms developed through centuries and a recently developed contemporary art . Despite often displaying local ingenuity , Indonesian arts have absorbed foreign influencesmost notably from India , the Arab world , China and Europe , as a result of contacts and interactions facilitated , and often motivated , by trade . Painting is an Balinese art , where its people are famed for their artistry . Their painting tradition started as classical Kamasan or Wayang style visual narrative , derived from visual art discovered on Candi of Indonesia bas reliefs in eastern Java .
There have been numerous discoveries of Megalithic art in Indonesia . Subsequently , tribal art has flourished within the culture of Nias people , Batak people , Asmat people , Dayak people and Toraja . Wood and stone are common materials used as the media for sculpting among these tribes . Between the 8th and 15th centuries , the Javanese civilisation has developed a refined stone sculpting art and architecture which was influenced by Hindu-Buddhist Dharma civilisation . The temples of Borobudur and Prambanan are among the most famous examples of the practice .
As with the arts , Indonesian architecture has absorbed foreign influences that have brought cultural changes and profound effect on building styles and techniques . The most dominant has traditionally been Architecture of India ; however , Chinese , Arab , and European influences have also been significant . Traditional carpentry , masonry , stone and woodwork techniques and decorations have thrived in vernacular architecture , with numbers of traditional houses ' ( rumah adat ) styles that have been developed . The traditional houses and settlements in the country vary by ethnic groups , and each has a specific custom and history . Examples include Toraja 's Tongkonan , Minangkabau people 's Rumah Gadang and Rangkiang , Javanese style Pendopo pavilion with Joglo style roof , Dayak people 's longhouses , various Rumah Melayu , Balinese architecture and Balinese temple , and also different forms of rice barns ( lumbung ) .
=== Music , dance and clothing ===
The music of Indonesia predates historical records . Various indigenous tribes incorporate chants and songs accompanied by musical instruments in their rituals . Angklung , kacapi suling , gong , gamelan , talempong , kulintang , and sasando are examples of traditional Indonesian instruments . The diverse world of Indonesian music genres is the result of the musical creativity of its people , and subsequent cultural encounters with foreign influences . These include Qanbs and qasida from the Middle East , keroncong from Portugal , and dangdutone of the most popular music genres in Indonesiawith notable Hindi influence as well as Malay orchestras . Today , the Indonesian music industry enjoys both nationwide and regional popularity in Malaysia , Singapore , and Brunei , due to common culture and intelligible languages between Indonesian language and Malay language .
Indonesian dances have a diverse history , with more than 3,000 original dances . Scholars believe that they had their beginning in rituals and religious worship . Examples include war dances , a dance of witch doctors , and dance to call for rain or any agricultural rituals such as Hudoq . Indonesian dances derive its influences from the archipelago 's prehistoric and tribal , Hindu-Buddhist , and Islamic periods . Recently , modern dances and urban teen dances have gained popularity due to the influence of Western culture , as well as those of Japan and South Korea to some extent . Various traditional dances , however , including those of Java , Bali and Dayak continue to be a living and dynamic tradition .
Indonesia has various styles of clothing as a result of its long and rich cultural history . The national costume has its origins in the indigenous culture of the country and traditional textile traditions . The Javanese Batik and Kebaya are arguably Indonesia 's most recognised national costume , though they have Sundanese people and Balinese people origins as well . Each province has a representation of traditional attire and dress , such as Ulos of Batak from North Sumatra ; Songket of Malays ( ethnic group ) and Minangkabau people from Sumatra ; and Ikat of Sasak people from Lombok . People wear national and regional costumes during traditional weddings , formal ceremonies , music performances , government and official occasions , and they vary from traditional to modern attire .
=== Theatre and cinema ===
Wayang , the Javanese , Sundanese , and Balinese shadow puppet theatre display several mythological legends such as Ramayana and Mahabharata . Other forms of local drama include the Javanese Ludruk and Ketoprak , the Sundanese Sandiwara , Betawi Lenong , and various Balinese dance drama . They incorporate humour and jest and often involve audiences in their performances . Some theatre traditions also include music , dancing and the Pencak Silat martial art such as Randai from Minangkabau people of West Sumatra . It is usually performed for traditional ceremonies and festivals , and based on semi-historical Minangkabau legends and love story . Modern performing art also developed in Indonesia with their distinct style of drama . Notable theatre , dance , and drama troupe such as Teater Koma are famous as it often portrays social and political satire of Indonesian society .
The first film produced in the archipelago was Loetoeng Kasaroeng , a silent film by Dutch director L. Heuveldorp . The film industry expanded after independence , with six films made in 1949 rising to 58 in 1955 . Usmar Ismail , who made significant imprints in the 1950s and 1960s , is generally considered to be the pioneer of Indonesian films . The Guided Democracy in Indonesia saw the use of cinema for nationalistic , anti-Western purposes , and foreign films were subsequently banned , while the New Order utilised a censorship code that aimed to maintain social order . Production of films peaked during the 1980s , although it declined significantly in the next decade . Notable films in this period include Satan 's Slave ( 1980 film ) ( 1980 ) , Nagabonar ( 1987 ) , Tjoet Nja ' Dhien ( 1988 ) , Catatan Si Boy ( 1989 ) , and Warkop 's comedy films .
Independent filmmaking was a rebirth of the film industry since 1998 , where films started addressing previously banned topics , such as religion , race , and love . Between 2000 and 2005 , the number of films released each year steadily increased . Riri Riza and Mira Lesmana were among the new generation of filmmakers who co-directed Kuldesak ( 1999 ) , Petualangan Sherina ( 2000 ) , Ada Apa dengan Cinta ? ( 2002 ) , and Laskar Pelangi ( 2008 ) . In 2016 , Warkop DKI Reborn : Jangkrik Boss Part 1 smashed box office records , becoming the most-watched Indonesian film with 6.8 ; million tickets sold . Indonesia has held annual film festivals and awards , including the Indonesian Film Festival ( Festival Film Indonesia ) that has been held intermittently since 1955 . It hands out the Citra Award , the film industry 's most prestigious award . From 1973 to 1992 , the festival was held annually and then discontinued until its revival in 2004.
=== Mass media and literature ===
Media of Indonesia freedom increased considerably after the fall of the New Order , during which the Ministry of Information monitored and controlled domestic media and restricted foreign media . The television market includes several national commercial networks and provincial networks that compete with public TVRI , which held a monopoly on TV broadcasting from 1962 to 1989 . By the early 21st century , the improved communications system had brought television signals to every village , and people can choose from up to 11 channels . Private radio stations carry news bulletins while foreign broadcasters supply programmes . The number of printed publications has increased significantly since 1998.
Like other developing countries , Indonesia began development of the Internet in the early 1990s . Its first commercial Internet service provider , PT . Indo Internet began operation in Jakarta in 1994 . The country had 171 ; million Internet users in 2018 , with a penetration rate that keeps increasing annually . Most are between the ages of 15 and 19 and depend primarily on mobile phones for access , outnumbering both laptops and computers .
The oldest evidence of writing in the Indonesian archipelago is a series of Sanskrit inscriptions dated to the 5th century . Many of Indonesia 's peoples have firmly rooted oral traditions , which help to define and preserve their cultural identities . In written poetry and prose , several traditional forms dominate , mainly syair , pantun , gurindam , List of Hikayat and Javanese historical texts . Examples of these forms include Syair Abdul Muluk , Hikayat Hang Tuah , Malay Annals , and Babad Tanah Jawi .
Early modern Indonesian literature originates in Sumatran tradition . Literature and poetry flourished during the decades leading up to and after independence . Balai Pustaka , the government bureau for popular literature , was instituted in 1917 to promote the development of indigenous literature . Many scholars consider the 1950s and 1960s to be the Golden Age of Indonesian Literature . The style and characteristics of modern Indonesian literature vary according to the dynamics of the country 's political and social landscape , most notably the war of independence in the second half of the 1940s and the anti-communist mass killings in the mid-1960s . Notable literary figures of the modern era include Multatuli , Chairil Anwar , Mohammad Yamin , Merari Siregar , Marah Roesli , Pramoedya Ananta Toer , and Ayu Utami .
=== Cuisine ===
Indonesian cuisine is one of the most diverse , vibrant , and colourful in the world , full of intense flavour . Many regional cuisines exist , often based upon indigenous culture and foreign influences such as Chinese , European , Middle Eastern , and Indian precedents . Rice is the leading staple food and is served with side dishes of meat and vegetables . Spices ( notably chilli ) , coconut milk , fish and chicken are fundamental ingredients .
Some popular dishes such as nasi goreng , gado-gado , Satay , and Soto ( food ) are ubiquitous and considered as national dishes . The Ministry of Tourism , however , chose tumpeng as the official national dish in 2014 , describing it as binding the diversity of various culinary traditions . Other popular dishes include rendang , one of the many Padang cuisines along with dendeng and gulai . Another fermented food is oncom , similar in some ways to tempeh but uses a variety of bases ( not only soy ) , created by different fungi , and is prevalent in West Java .
=== Sports ===
Sports are generally male-oriented , and spectators are often associated with illegal gambling . Badminton and association football are the most popular sports . Indonesia is among the only five countries that have won the Thomas Cup and Uber Cup , the world team championship of men 's and women 's badminton . Along with Olympic weightlifting , it is the sport that contributes the most to Indonesia at the Olympics Indonesia 's Olympic medal tally . Liga 1 ( Indonesia ) is the country 's premier football club league . On the international stage , Indonesia national football team was the first Asian team to participate at the FIFA World Cup in 1938 FIFA World Cup as the Dutch East Indies . On a regional level , Indonesia won a bronze medal at the 1958 Asian Games as well as two gold medals at the 1987 Southeast Asian Games and 1991 Southeast Asian Games ( SEA Games ) . Indonesia 's first appearance at the AFC Asian Cup was in 1996 AFC Asian Cup and successfully qualified for the next three tournaments , although they never make the knockout phase .
Other popular sports include boxing and basketball , which has a long history in Indonesia and was part of the first National Sports Week ( Indonesia ) ( Pekan Olahraga Nasional , PON ) in 1948 . Some of the famous Indonesian boxers include Ellyas Pical , three times International Boxing Federation Super flyweight champion ; Nico Thomas , Muhammad Rachman , and Chris John ( boxer ) . In motorsport , Rio Haryanto became the first Indonesian to compete in Formula One in 2016 . Sepak takraw and karapan sapi ( bull racing ) in Madura Island are some examples of traditional sports in Indonesia . In areas with a history of tribal warfare , mock fighting contests are held , such as caci in Flores and pasola in Sumba . Pencak Silat is an Indonesian martial art and in 1987 , became one of the sporting events in the SEA Games , with Indonesia appearing as one of the leading competitors . In Southeast Asia , Indonesia is one of the top sports powerhouses by winning the SEA Games ten times since 1977 , most recently in 2011 Southeast Asian Games .

Sierra Leone ( , also , ) , officially the Republic of Sierra Leone , informally Salone , is a country on the southwest coast of West Africa . It is bordered by Liberia to the southeast and Guinea to the northeast . Sierra Leone has a tropical climate with a diverse environment ranging from savanna to rainforests , a total area of and a population of 7,092,113 as of the 2015 census . The capital and largest city is Freetown . The country is divided into five administrative regions which are subdivided into Districts of Sierra Leone . Sierra Leone is a constitutional republic with a unicameral parliament and a directly elected president . Sierra Leone is a Muslim majority country at approximately 78 % , though with a politically influential Christians minority at about 21 % . Muslims and Christians interact very well together and religious violence is extremely rare in the country . All the major Muslim and Christian holidays are officially national holidays in the country .
Sierra Leone achieved independence from the United Kingdom on 27 April 1961 , and Milton Margai became the country 's first Prime Minister . Sierra Leone held its first general election as an independent nation on May 27 , 1962 . Siaka Stevens was democratically elected Prime Minister in 1967 , however , once in office , he became increasingly authoritarian during his rule from 1968 to 1985 . From 1978 to 1985 , Stevens ' APC party was the only legal political party in Sierra Leone , and all other political parties were banned .
The multiparty democratic constitution of Sierra Leone was again adopted in 1991 by President Joseph Saidu Momoh , Stevens ' hand-picked choice . From March 23 , 1991 to 2002 , a group of former Sierra Leone soldiers launched a brutal civil war in a failed attempt to overthrow the Sierra Leone Government . The APC 's 24-year rule of Sierra Leone ended on April 29 , 1992 in a military coup and a 25-year-old Captain ( armed forces ) Valentine Strasser ruled the country from 1992 to 1996 in a junta government .
Sierra Leone returned to a democratically elected government when the military junta under Brigadier Julius Maada Bio handed the presidency to Ahmad Tejan Kabbah of the Sierra Leone People 's Party ( SLPP ) after his victory in the 1996 election . However , the Sierra Leone military overthrew President Kabbah in a coup on May 25 , 1997 , A coalition of West African ECOWAS armed forces led by Nigeria reinstated President Kabbah in February 1998 . In January 2002 , President Kabbah officially announced the end of the civil war . Sierra Leone has uninterrupted democratic government from 1998 to the present day .
Sixteen ethnic groups inhabit Sierra Leone , the two largest and most influential being the Temne people and Mende people peoples . About 2 % of the country 's population are Krio people , descendants of freed African American and West Indian slaves . English is the official language used in schools and government administration ; however , Krio language is the most widely spoken language across Sierra Leone , spoken by 97 % of the country 's population . Sierra Leone is very rich in natural resources , especially diamond , gold , bauxite and aluminum . The country is a member of the United Nations , African Union , Economic Community of West African States ( ECOWAS ) , Mano River Union , Commonwealth of Nations , African Development Bank , and Organisation of Islamic Cooperation .
==Etymology==
The country takes its name from the Lion Mountains near Freetown . Originally named Serra Leoa ( Portuguese language for `` Lioness Mountains '' ) by Portuguese explorer Pedro de Sintra in 1462 , the modern name is derived from the Italian language spelling , which was introduced by Republic of Venice explorer Alvise Cadamosto and subsequently copied by other European cartography .
== History of Sierra Leone ==
=== Early history ===
Archaeological finds show that Sierra Leone has been inhabited continuously for at least 2,500 years , populated successively by societies who migrated from other parts of Africa . The use of iron was adopted by the 9th century , and by 1000 AD , agriculture was being practised along the coast . Over time , the climate changed considerably , altering boundaries between different ecological zones , affecting migration and conquest .
Sierra Leone 's dense tropical rainforest and swampy environment was considered impenetrable ; it was also host to the tsetse fly , which carried a disease fatal to horses and the zebu cattle used by the Mande people . This environment protected its people from conquest by the Mande and other African empires , and limited the influence of the Mali Empire . Islam was introduced by Sosso Empire traders , merchants and migrants from the north and east , becoming widely adopted in the 18th century .
===European trading===
European contacts within Sierra Leone were among the first in West Africa in the 15th century . In 1462 , Portuguese discoveries Pedro de Sintra mapped the hills surrounding what is now Freetown Harbour , naming the shaped formation Serra da Leoa or `` Serra Leoa '' ( Portuguese language for Lioness Mountains ) . The Spanish rendering of this geographic formation is Sierra Leona , which later was adapted and , misspelled , became the country 's current name . Although according to the professor C. Magbaily Fyle this could have been a misinterpretation of historians : according to him , there has been evidence of travellers calling the region Serra Lyoa well before 1462 , the year when Sintra first arrived . This would imply that the identity of the person who named Sierra Leone is unknown .
Soon after Sintra 's expedition , Portuguese traders arrived at the harbour . By 1495 they had built a fortified trading post on the coast . The Dutch Republic and Kingdom of France also set up trade here , and each nation used Sierra Leone as a trading point for slaves brought by African traders from interior areas undergoing wars and conflicts over territory . In 1562 , the Kingdom of England initiated the Triangle Trade when admiral John Hawkins ( naval commander ) of the Royal Navy transported 300 enslaved Africans  acquired `` by the sword and partly by other means ''  to the Spanish colony of Santo Domingo on Hispaniola in the Caribbean Sea area of the West Indies islands , where he sold them .
=== Early colonies ===
In the late 18th century , many African-Americans claimed the protection of the British Crown . There were thousands of these Black Loyalists , people of African descent who joined the British military forces during the American Revolutionary War . Many of these Loyalist ( American Revolution ) had been slaves who escaped to join the British , lured by promises of freedom ( emancipation ) . The official documentation known as the Book of Negroes lists thousands of freed slaves whom the British evacuated from the nascent United States and resettled in colonies elsewhere in British North America ( north to Canada , or south to the West Indies ) .
In 1787 the British Crown founded a settlement in Sierra Leone in what was called the `` Province of Freedom '' . It intended to resettle some of the `` Black Poor of London '' , some of whom were African-Americans freed by the British during the war . About 400 blacks and 60 whites reached Sierra Leone on 15 May 1787 . The group also included some West Indies of African descent from London . After they established Granville Town , most of the first group of colonists died , owing to disease and warfare with the indigenous African peoples ( Temne people ) , who resisted their encroachment . The 64 ; remaining colonists established a second Granville Town .
Following the American Revolution , more than 3,000 Black Loyalists had also been settled in Nova Scotia , where they were finally granted land . They founded Birchtown , Nova Scotia , but faced harsh winters and racial discrimination from nearby Shelburne , Nova Scotia . Thomas Peters ( black leader ) pressed British authorities for relief and more aid ; together with British abolitionist John Clarkson ( abolitionist ) , the Sierra Leone Company was established to relocate Black Loyalists who wanted to take their chances in West Africa . In 1792 nearly 1200 ; persons from Nova Scotia crossed the Atlantic to build the second ( and only permanent ) Colony of Sierra Leone and the settlement of Freetown on 11 March 1792 . In Sierra Leone they were called the Nova Scotian Settlers , the Nova Scotians , or the Settlers .
The Settlers built Freetown in the styles they knew from their lives in the American South ; they also continued American fashion and American manners . In addition , many continued to practise Methodism in Freetown . Black settlers in Sierra Leone enjoyed much more autonomy in that they were more politically engaged . Black immigrants elected different levels of political representatives , 'tithingmen ' , who represented each dozen settlers , and 'hundreders ' who represented larger amounts . This sort of representation was not available in Nova Scotia . The initial process of society-building in Freetown , however , was a harsh struggle . The Crown did not supply enough basic supplies and provisions , and the Settlers were continually threatened by illegal slave trading and the risk of re-enslavement . In the 1790s , the Settlers , including adult women , voted for the first time in elections . The Sierra Leone Company , controlled by London investors , refused to allow the settlers to take fee simple of the land . In 1799 some of the settlers revolted . The Crown subdued the revolt by bringing in forces of more than 500 ; Jamaican Maroons , whom they transported from Cudjoe 's Town ( Trelawny Town ) via Nova Scotia in 1800 . Led by Colonel Montague James , the Maroons helped the colonial forces to put down the revolt , and in the process the Jamaican Maroons in Sierra Leone secured the best houses and farms .
On 1 January 1808 , Thomas Ludlam ( colonialist ) , the Governor of the Sierra Leone Company and a leading abolitionist , surrendered the company 's charter . This ended its 16 ; years of running the Colony . The British Crown reorganised the Sierra Leone Company as the African Institution ; it was directed to improve the local economy . Its members represented both British who hoped to inspire local entrepreneurs and those with interest in the Macauley & Babington Company , which held the ( British ) monopoly on Sierra Leone trade .
At about the same time ( following the Slave Trade Act 1807 ) , British crews delivered thousands of formerly enslaved Africans to Freetown , after liberating them from illegal slave ships . These Liberated Africans or recaptives were sold for $ 20 a head as apprentices to the white settlers , Nova Scotian Settlers , and the Jamaican Maroons . Some of the recaptives who were not sold as apprentices were forced to join the Navy . Many recaptives were treated poorly and even abused because some of the original settlers considered them their property . Cut off from their various homelands and traditions , the Liberated Africans were forced to assimilate to the Western styles of Settlers and Maroons . For example , some of the recaptives were forced to change their name to a more Western sounding one . Though some people happily embraced these changes because they considered it as being part of the community , some were not happy with these changes and wanted to keep their own identity . Many recaptives were so unhappy that they risked the possibility of being sold back into slavery by leaving Sierra Leone and going back to their original villages . They built a flourishing trade in flowers and beads on the West African coast .
These returned Africans were from many areas of Africa , but principally the west coast . During the 19th century , freed black Americans , some Americo Liberian 'refugees ' , and particularly West Indians , also immigrated and settled in Freetown . Together these peoples created a new creole ethnicity called the Krio people ( initially called Creoles ) and a trading language , Krio language , which became commonly used among many of the ethnicities in the country .
=== Colonial era ( 18001961 ) ===
The settlement of Sierra Leone in the 1800s was unique in that the population was composed of displaced Africans who were brought to the colony after the British abolition of the slave trade in 1807 . Upon arrival in Sierra Leone , each `` recaptive '' was given a registration number , and information on their physical qualities would be entered into the Register of Liberated Africans . However , oftentimes the documentation would be overwhelmingly subjective and would result in inaccurate entries , making them difficult to track . In addition , differences between the Register of Liberated Africans of 1808 and the List of Captured Negroes of 1812 ( which emulated the 1808 document ) revealed some disparities in the entries of the recaptives , specifically in the names ; many recaptives decided to change their given names to more anglicised versions which contributed to the difficulty in tracking them after they arrived in Sierra Leone .
According to the British Act for the Abolition of the Slave Trade in 1807 , the recaptives could be subject to apprenticeships led by British colonists in Sierra Leone and the males enlisted into the Army or Navy . In many instances , the recaptives who were assigned to apprenticeships were sold for $ 20 , giving the apprenticeship system qualities similar to slavery . It is documented that the recaptive apprentices were unpaid and the settlers who they were appointed to had devices which could be used to discipline them , namely sticks . According to Suzanne Schwartz , a historian on colonial Sierra Leone , in June 1808 a group of 21 men and women ran away to the nearby native settlement of Robiss and upon recapture were imprisoned by the settlers in Sierra Leone , thus contributing to the slavery-like qualities of the apprenticeship system .
In the early 19th century , Freetown served as the residence of the British colonial governor of the region , who also administered the Gold Coast ( British colony ) ( now Ghana ) and the Gambia settlements . Sierra Leone developed as the educational centre of British West Africa . The British established Fourah Bay College here in 1827 , which rapidly became a magnet for English-speaking Africans on the West Coast . For more than a century , it was the only European-style university in western Sub-Saharan Africa .
The British interacted mostly with the Krios in Freetown , who did most of the trading with the indigenous peoples of the interior . In addition , educated Krios held numerous positions in the colonial government , giving them status and well-paying positions . Following the Berlin Conference of 18841885 , the UK decided that it needed to establish more dominion over the inland areas , to satisfy what was described by the European powers as `` effective occupation '' of territories . In 1896 it annexed these areas , declaring them the Sierra Leone Protectorate . With this change , the British began to expand their administration in the region , recruiting British citizens to posts , and pushing Krios out of positions in government and even the desirable residential areas in Freetown .
During the British annexation to Sierra Leone , there were several chiefs in the Northern and Southern part of the country who were also resisting the hut tax war but they used diplomacy to achieve their goal . To the north , from 1820 to 1906 there was a Limba chief named Almamy Suluku who ruled his territory for many years , fighting different tribes to protect his territory , while at the same time using diplomacy to trick the protectorate and sending fighters to assist Bai Bureh . http : //www.sierra-leone.org/Heroes/heroes5.html .
Another prominent figure in Sierra Leone history is Bai Sherbro ( ) . Bai Sherbro was a chief and warrior in Bonte Island , which is in the southwestern part of the country . He , like Bai Bureh , exercised resistance to the British . Bai Sherbro also sent fighters to Bai Bureh  s camp to help him fight against the British . Bai Sherbro was influential and powerful , so the British greatly feared him . Bai Sherbro was subsequently captured , and along with Bai Bureh exiled to the Gold Coast , which is now modern day Ghana . http : //www.sierra-leone.org/Heroes/heroes5.html .
Nyagua , ( ) , also known as the tracking king , was a fierce King who captured many districts and many came to join him for protection . Nyagua was also resistant to the British cause . However , Nyagua , realizing that he lacked sufficient strength , attempted to use diplomacy . At the same time , he sent warriors to assist Bai Bureh to fight against the British . The British later captured Nyagua , and he was also exiled to the Gold Coast . http : //www.sierra-leone.org/Heroes/heroes5.html .
Madam Yoko , ( ) was a brilliant woman of culture and ambition . She employed her capacity for friendly communications to persuade the British to give her control of the Kpaa Mende chiefdom . She used diplomacy to communicate with many local chiefs who did not trust her friendship with the British . Because Madam Yoko supported the British , some sub-chiefs rebelled , causing Yoko to take refuge in the police barracks . For her loyalty , she was awarded a silver medal by Queen Victoria . Until 1906 Madam Yoko ruled as a paramount chief in the new British Protectorate . Sadly , it appears that she committed suicide at the age of fifty-five , perhaps due to the loss of support from her own people . http : //www.sierra-leone.org/Heroes/heroes5.html .
In addition , the British annexation of the Protectorate interfered with the sovereignty of indigenous chiefs . They designated chiefs as units of local government , rather than dealing with them individually as had been the previous practice . They did not maintain relationships even with longtime allies , such as Bai Bureh , chief of Kasseh , a community on the Small Scarcies River . He was later unfairly portrayed as a prime instigator of the Hut Tax war in 1898.
Colonel Frederic Cardew , military governor of the Protectorate , in 1898 established a new tax on dwellings and demanded that the chiefs use their peoples to maintain roads . The taxes were often higher than the value of the dwellings , and 24 chiefs signed a petition to Cardew , stating how destructive this was ; their people could not afford to take time off from their subsistence agriculture . They resisted payment of taxes . Tensions over the new colonial requirements , and the administration 's suspicions towards the chiefs , led to the Hut Tax War of 1898 , also called the Temne-Mende War . The British fired first . The Northern front of majority Temne people was led by Bai Bureh . The Southern front , consisting mostly of Mende people , entered the conflict somewhat later for other reasons .
For several months , Bureh 's fighters had the advantage over the vastly more powerful British forces , but the British troops and Bureh 's warriors suffered hundreds of fatalities . Bai Bureh finally surrendered on 11 November 1898 to end the destruction of his people 's territory and dwellings . Although the British government recommended leniency , Cardew insisted on sending the chief and two allies into exile in the Gold Coast ; his government hanged 96 of the chief 's warriors . Bai Bureh was allowed to return in 1905 , when he resumed his chieftaincy of Kasseh .
The defeat of the Temne and Mende in the Hut Tax war ended mass resistance to the Protectorate and colonial government , but intermittent rioting and labour unrest continued throughout the colonial period . Riots in 1955 and 1956 involved `` many tens of thousands '' of Sierra Leonians in the protectorate .
Domestic Slavery in Africa , which continued to be practised by local African elites , was abolished in 1928 . A notable event in 1935 was the granting of a monopoly on mineral mining to the Sierra Leone Selection Trust , run by De Beers . The monopoly was scheduled to last 98 years . Mining of diamonds in the east and other minerals expanded , drawing labourers there from other parts of the country .
In 1924 , the UK government divided Sierra Leone into a Colony and a Protectorate , with different political systems constitutionally defined for each . The Colony was Freetown and its coastal area ; the Protectorate was defined as the hinterland areas dominated by local chiefs . Antagonism between the two entities escalated to a heated debate in 1947 , when proposals were introduced to provide for a single political system for both the Colony and the Protectorate . Most of the proposals came from leaders of the Protectorate , whose population far outnumbered that in the colony . The Krios , led by I. T. A. Wallace-Johnson Isaac Wallace-Johnson , opposed the proposals , as they would have resulted in reducing the political power of the Krios in the Colony .
In 1951 , educated protectorate leaders from different groups , including Sir Milton Margai , Lamina Sankoh , Siaka Stevens , Mohamed Sanusi Mustapha , John Karefa-Smart , Kande Bureh , Sir Albert Margai , Amadu Wurie and Sir Banja Tejan-Sie joined together with the powerful paramount chiefs in the protectorate to form the Sierra Leone People 's Party or SLPP as the party of the protectorate . The SLPP leadership , led by Sir Milton Margai , negotiated with the British and the educated Krio-dominated colony based in Freetown to achieve independence .
Owing to the astute politics of Milton Margai of the Mende people , the educated Protectorate elite was won over to join forces with the paramount chiefs in the face of Krio intransigence . Later , Margai used the same skills to win over opposition leaders and moderate Krio elements to achieve independence from the UK . In November 1951 , Margai oversaw the drafting of a new constitution , which united the separate Colonial and Protectorate legislatures and provided a framework for decolonisation . In 1953 , Sierra Leone was granted local ministerial powers and Margai was elected Chief Minister of Sierra Leone . The new constitution ensured Sierra Leone a parliamentary system within the Commonwealth of Nations . In May 1957 , Sierra Leone held its first parliamentary election . The SLPP , which was then the most popular political party in the colony of Sierra Leone as well as being supported by the powerful paramount chiefs in the provinces , won the most seats in Parliament and Margai was re-elected as Chief Minister by a landslide .
=== 1960 Independence Conference ===
On 20 April 1960 , Milton Margai led a 24-member Sierra Leonean delegation at constitutional conferences that were held with the Government of Queen Elizabeth II and British Colonial Secretary Iain Macleod in negotiations for independence held in London .
On the conclusion of talks in London on 4 May 1960 , the United Kingdom agreed to grant Sierra Leone independence on 27 April 1961.
=== Independence ( 1961 ) and Margai Administration ( 19611964 ) ===
On 27 April 1961 , Sir Milton Margai led Sierra Leone to independence from Great Britain and became the country 's first Prime Minister . Thousands of Sierra Leoneans took to the streets in celebration . The Dominion of Sierra Leone retained a parliamentary system of government and was a member of the Commonwealth of Nations . The leader of the main opposition All People 's Congress ( APC ) , Siaka Stevens , along with Isaac Wallace-Johnson , another outspoken critic of the SLPP government , were arrested and placed under [ arrest ] in Freetown , along with sixteen others charged with disrupting the independence celebration .
In May 1962 , Sierra Leone held its Sierra Leonean general election , 1962 as an independent nation . The Sierra Leone People 's Party ( SLPP ) won a Plurality ( voting ) of seats in parliament , and Milton Margai was re-elected as prime minister .
Margai was very popular among Sierra Leoneans during his time in power , most known for his self-effacement . He was neither corrupt nor did he make a lavish display of his power or status . He based the government on the rule of law and the separation of powers , with multiparty political institutions and fairly viable representative structures . Margai used his conservative ideology to lead Sierra Leone without much strife . He appointed government officials to represent various ethnic groups . Margai employed a brokerage style of politics , by sharing political power among political parties and interest groups ; and with the powerful paramount chiefs in the provinces , most of whom were key allies of his government .
===Final years of democracy ( 19641967 ) ===
Upon Milton Margai 's unexpected death in 1964 , his [ Sir Albert Margai ] , was appointed as Prime Minister by parliament . Sir Albert 's leadership was briefly challenged by Foreign Minister [ [ John Karefa-Smart , who questioned Sir Albert 's succession to the SLPP leadership position . Karefa-Smart led a prominent small minority faction within the SLPP party in opposition of Albert Margai as Prime Minister . However , Karefa-Smart failed to receive strong support within the SLPP and the SLPP dominated members of parliament in his attempt to have Albert Margai stripped of his position as the leader of the SLPP and prime minister of the country . The large majority of SLPP members backed Albert Margai over Karefa-Smart . Soon after Albert Margai was sworn in as Prime Minister , he dismissed several senior government officials who had served under his elder brother Milton 's government , viewing them as a threat to his administration , including Karefa-Smart .
Sir Albert resorted to increasingly authoritarian actions in response to protests and enacted several laws against the opposition All People 's Congress ( APC ) , whilst attempting to establish a one-party state . Sir Albert was opposed to the colonial legacy of allowing executive powers to the Paramount Chiefs , many of whom had been key allies of his late brother Sir Milton . Accordingly , they began to consider Sir Albert a threat to the ruling houses across the country . Margai appointed many non-Creoles to the country 's civil service in Freetown , in an overall diversification of the civil service in the capital , which had been dominated by members of the Creole ethnic group . As a result , Albert Margai became unpopular in the Creole community , many of whom had supported Sir Milton . Margai was accused of favouring members of his own Mende ethnic group for prominent positions .
In 1967 , riots broke out in Freetown against Margai 's policies ; in response he declared a state of emergency across the country . Sir Albert was accused of corruption and of a policy of affirmative action in favour of his own Mende people ethnic group . Although possessing the full backing of the country 's security forces , he called for free and fair elections .
=== Military coups ( 19671968 ) ===
The APC , with its leader Siaka Stevens , narrowly won a small majority of seats in Parliament over the SLPP in a closely contested Sierra Leonean general election , 1967 . Stevens was sworn in as Prime Minister on 21 March 1967.
Within hours after taking office , Stevens was ousted in a bloodless military coup led by Brigadier General David Lansana , the commander of the Republic of Sierra Leone Armed Forces . He was a close ally of Albert Margai , who had appointed him to the position in 1964 . Lansana placed Stevens under [ arrest ] in Freetown and insisted that the determination of Prime Minister should await the election of the tribal representatives to the House . Upon his release , Stevens went into exile in Guinea .
On 23 March 1967 , a group of military officers in the Sierra Leone Army led by Brigadier General Andrew Juxon-Smith , overrode this action by a coup d'tat ; they seized control of the government , arresting Lansana , and suspending the constitution . The group set up the National Reformation Council ( NRC ) , with Andrew Juxon-Smith as its chairman and Head of State of the country .
On 18 April 1968 a group of low ranking soldiers in the Sierra Leone Army who called themselves the Anti-Corruption Revolutionary Movement ( ACRM ) , led by Brigadier General John Amadu Bangura , Sergeants ' Coup ( Sierra Leone ) the NRC Military junta . The ACRM junta arrested many senior NRC members . They reinstated the constitution and returned power to Stevens , who at last assumed the office of Prime Minister .
=== One-party state ( 19681991 ) ===
Stevens assumed power again in 1968 with a great deal of hope and ambition . Much trust was placed upon him as he championed multiparty politics . Stevens had campaigned on a platform of bringing the tribes together under socialist principles . During his first decade or so in power , Stevens renegotiated some of what he called `` useless prefinanced schemes '' contracted by his predecessors , both Albert Margai of the SLPP and Juxon-Smith of the NRC . Some of these policies by the SLPP and the NRC were said to have left the country in an economically deprived state .
Stevens reorganised the country 's oil refinery , the government-owned Cape Sierra Hotel , and a cement factory . He cancelled Juxon-Smith 's construction of a church and mosque on the grounds of Victoria Park ( since mid 2017 Freetown Amusement Park ) . Stevens began efforts that would later bridge the distance between the provinces and the city . Roads and hospitals were constructed in the provinces , and Paramount Chiefs and provincial peoples became a prominent force in Freetown .
Under pressure of several coup attempts , real or perceived , Stevens ' rule grew more and more authoritarian , and his relationship with some of his ardent supporters deteriorated . He removed the SLPP party from competitive politics in general elections , some believed , through the use of violence and intimidation . To maintain the support of the military , Stevens retained the popular John Amadu Bangura as head of the Sierra Leone Armed Forces .
After the return to civilian rule , by-elections were held ( beginning in autumn 1968 ) and an all-APC cabinet was appointed . Calm was not completely restored . In November 1968 , unrest in the provinces led Stevens to declare a state of emergency across the country . Many senior officers in the Sierra Leone Army were greatly disappointed with Stevens ' policies and his handling of the Sierra Leone Military , but none could confront Stevens . Brigadier General Bangura , who had reinstated Stevens as Prime Minister , was widely considered the only person who could control Stevens . The army was devoted to Bangura , and this made him potentially dangerous to Stevens . In January 1970 , Bangura was arrested and charged with Conspiracy ( crime ) and plotting to commit a coup against the Stevens government . After a trial that lasted a few months , Bangura was convicted and Capital punishment . On 29 March 1970 , Brigadier Bangura was executed by hanging in Freetown .
After the execution of Bangura , a group of soldiers loyal to the executed general held a mutiny in Freetown and other parts of the country in opposition to Stevens ' government . Dozens of soldiers were arrested and convicted by a court martial in Freetown for their participation in the mutiny against the president . Among the soldiers arrested was a little-known army Corporal , Foday Sankoh , a strong Bangura supporter . Corporal Sankoh was convicted and jailed for seven years at the Pademba Road Prison in Freetown .
In April 1971 , a new republican constitution was adopted under which Stevens became president . In the 1972 by-elections , the opposition SLPP complained of intimidation and procedural obstruction by the APC and militia . These problems became so severe that the SLPP boycotted the Sierra Leonean general election , 1973 ; as a result the APC won 84 of the 85 elected seats .
An alleged plot to overthrow president Stevens failed in 1974 and its leaders were executed . In mid-1974 , Guinean soldiers , as requested by Stevens , were stationed in the country to help maintain his hold on power , as Stevens was a close ally of then-Guinean president Ahmed Sekou Toure . In March 1976 , Stevens was elected without opposition for a second five-year term as president . On 19 July 1975 , 14 senior army and government officials , including David Lansana , former cabinet minister Mohamed Sorie Forna ( father of writer Aminatta Forna ) , Brigadier General Ibrahim Bash Taqi and Lieutenant Habib Lansana Kamara were executed after being convicted of attempting a coup to topple president Stevens ' government .
In 1977 , a nationwide student demonstration against the government disrupted Sierra Leone politics . The demonstration was quickly put down by the army and Stevens ' own personal Special Security Division ( SSD ) , a heavily armed paramilitary force he had created to protect him and maintain his hold on power . SSD officers were very loyal to Stevens and were deployed across Sierra Leone to put down any rebellion or protest against Stevens ' government . Sierra Leonean parliamentary election , 1977 was called later that year in which corruption was again endemic ; the APC won 74 seats and the SLPP 15 . In 1978 , the APC-dominant parliament approved a new constitution making the country a one-party state . The 1978 constitution made the APC the only legal political party in Sierra Leone . This move led to another major demonstration against the government in many parts of the country , but it was also put down by the army and Stevens ' SSD force .
Stevens is generally criticised for dictatorial methods and government corruption , but on a positive note , he kept the country stable and from collapsing into civil war . He created several government institutions that are still in use today . Stevens also reduced ethnic polarisation in government by incorporating members of various ethnic groups into his all-dominant APC government .
Siaka Stevens retired from politics in November 1985 after being in power for eighteen years . The APC named a new presidential candidate to succeed Stevens at its last delegate conference , held in Freetown in November 1985 . The candidate was Major General Joseph Saidu Momoh , head of the Sierra Leone Armed Forces and Stevens ' own choice to succeed him . As head of the armed forces , General Momoh had been very loyal to Stevens , who had appointed him to the position . Like Stevens , Momoh was also a member of the minority Limba people ( Sierra Leone ) ethnic group .
As the sole candidate , Momoh was elected president without opposition and sworn in as Sierra Leone 's second president on 28 November 1985 in Freetown . A one-party parliamentary election between APC members was held in May 1986 . President Momoh appointed his former military colleague and key ally , Major General Mohamed Tarawalie to succeed him as the head of the Sierra Leone Military . General Tarawalie was also a strong loyalist and key Momoh supporter . President Momoh named James Bambay Kamara as the head of the Sierra Leone Police . Bambay Kamara was also a strong Momoh loyalist and supporter . Momoh broke from former President Siaka Stevens by integrating the powerful SSD into the Sierra Leone Police as a special paramilitary force . Under President Stevens , the SSD had been a powerful personal force used to maintain his hold on power , independent from the Sierra Leone Military and Sierra Leone Police Force . The Sierra Leone Police under Bambay Kamara 's leadership , was accused of physical violence , arrest and intimidation against critics of President Momoh 's government .
President Momoh 's strong links with the army and his verbal attacks on corruption earned him much-needed initial support among Sierra Leoneans . With the lack of new faces in the new APC cabinet under president Momoh and the return of many of the old faces from Stevens ' government , criticisms soon arose that Momoh was simply perpetuating the rule of Stevens .
The next few years under the Momoh administration were characterised by corruption , which Momoh defused by sacking several senior cabinet ministers . To formalise his war against corruption , President Momoh announced a `` Code of Conduct for Political Leaders and Public Servants '' . After an alleged attempt to overthrow President Momoh in March 1987 , more than 60 senior government officials were arrested , including Vice-President Francis Minah , who was removed from office , convicted of plotting the coup , and executed by [ in 1989 , along with five others .
=== Sierra Leone Civil War ( 19912002 ) ===
In October 1990 , owing to mounting pressure from both within and outside the country for political and economic reform , president Momoh set up a constitutional review commission to assess the 1978 one-party constitution . Based on the commission 's recommendations a constitution re-establishing a multiparty system was approved by the exclusive APC Parliament by a 60 % majority vote , becoming effective on 1 October 1991 . There was great suspicion that president Momoh was not serious about his promise of political reform , as APC rule continued to be increasingly marked by abuses of power .
The brutal civil war that was going on in neighbouring Liberia ] played a significant role in the outbreak of fighting in Sierra Leone . [ [ Charles Taylor ( Liberia )  then leader of the National Patriotic Front of Liberia  reportedly helped form the Revolutionary United Front Revolutionary United Front ( RUF ) under the command of former Sierra Leonean army corporal Foday Sankoh , an ethnic Temne from Tonkolili District in Northern Sierra Leone . Sankoh was a British trained former army corporal who had also undergone guerrilla training in Libya . Taylor 's aim was for the RUF to attack the bases of Nigerian dominated peacekeeping troops in Sierra Leone who were opposed to his rebel movement in Liberia .
On 29 April 1992 , a group of young soldiers in the Sierra Leone Army , led by seven army officers  Lieutenant Sahr Sandy , Captain Valentine Strasser , Sergeant Solomon Musa , Captain Komba Mondeh , Lieutenant Tom Nyuma , Captain Julius Maada Bio and Captain Komba Kambo launched a military coup that sent president Momoh into exile in Guinea , and the young soldiers established the National Provisional Ruling Council ( NPRC ) , with 25-year-old Captain Valentine Strasser as its chairman and Head of State of the country .
Sergeant Solomon Musa , a childhood friend of Strasser , became the deputy chairman and deputy leader of the NPRC Military junta government . Strasser became the world 's youngest Head of State when he seized power just three days after his 25th birthday . The NPRC junta established the National Supreme Council of State as the military highest command and final authority in all matters , and was exclusively made up of the highest ranking NPRC soldiers , included Strasser himself and the original soldiers who toppled president Momoh .
One of the highest ranking soldiers of the NPRC Junta , Lieutenant Sahr Sandy , a trusted ally of Strasser , was assassinated , allegedly by Major S.I.M . Turay , a key loyalist of ousted president Momoh . A heavily armed military manhunt took place across the country to find Lieutenant Sandy 's killer . However , the main suspect , Major S.I.M Turay , went into hiding and fled the country to Guinea , fearing for his life . Dozens of soldiers loyal to the ousted president Momoh were arrested , including Colonel Kahota M. Dumbuya and Major Yayah Turay . Lieutenant Sandy was given a state funeral and his funeral prayers service at the cathedral church in Freetown was attended by many high-ranking soldiers of the NPRC junta , including Strasser himself and NPRC deputy leader Sergeant Solomon Musa .
The NPRC Junta immediately suspended the constitution , banned all political parties , limited freedom of speech and freedom of the press and enacted a rule-by-decree policy , in which soldiers were granted unlimited powers of administrative detention without charge or trial , and challenges against such detentions in court were precluded .
The NPRC Junta maintained relations with the Economic Community of West African States ( ECOWAS ) and strengthened support for Sierra Leone-based Economic Community of West African States Monitoring Group troops fighting in Liberia . On 28 December 1992 , an alleged coup attempt against the NPRC government of Strasser , aimed at freeing the detained Colonel Yahya Kanu , Colonel Kahota M.S . Dumbuya and former inspector general of police Bambay Kamara , was foiled . Several Junior army officers led by Sergeant Mohamed Lamin Bangura were identified as being behind the coup plot . The coup plot led to the firing squad execution of seventeen soldiers in the Sierra Leone Army including Colonel Kahota M Dumbuya , Major Yayah Kanu and Sergeant Mohamed Lamin Bangura . Several prominent members of the Momoh government who had been in detention at the Pa Demba Road prison , including former inspector general of police Bambay Kamara , were also executed .
On 5 July 1994 the deputy NPRC leader Sergeant Solomon Musa , who was very popular with the general population , particularly in Freetown , was arrested and sent into exile after he was accused of planning a coup to topple Strasser , an accusation Sergeant Musa denied . Strasser replaced Musa as deputy NPRC chairman with Captain Julius Maada Bio , who was instantly promoted by Strasser to Brigadier .
The NPRC proved to be nearly as ineffectual as the Momoh-led APC government in repelling the RUF . More and more of the country fell to RUF fighters , and by 1994 they held much of the diamond-rich Eastern Province and were at the edge of Freetown . In response , the NPRC hired several hundred mercenaries from the private firm Executive Outcomes . Within a month they had driven RUF fighters back to enclaves along Sierra Leone 's borders , and cleared the RUF from the Kono diamond-producing areas of Sierra Leone .
With Strasser 's two most senior NPRC allies and commanders Lieutenant Sahr Sandy and Lieutenant Solomon Musa no longer around to defend him , Strasser 's leadership within the NPRC Supreme Council of State was not considered much stronger . On 16 January 1996 , after about four years in power , Strasser was arrested in a palace coup at the Defence Headquarters in Freetown by his fellow NPRC soldiers . Strasser was immediately flown into exile in a military helicopter to Conakry , Guinea .
In his first public broadcast to the nation following the 1996 coup , Brigadier Bio stated that his support for returning Sierra Leone to a democratically elected civilian government and his commitment to ending the civil war were his motivations for the coup . Promises of a return to civilian rule were fulfilled by Bio , who handed power over to Ahmad Tejan Kabbah , of the Sierra Leone People 's Party ( SLPP ) , after the conclusion of elections in early 1996 . President Kabbah took power with a great promise of ending the civil war . President Kabbah opened dialogue with the RUF and invited RUF leader Foday Sankoh for peace negotiations .
On 25 May 1997 , seventeen soldiers in the Sierra Leone army led by Corporal Tamba Gborie , loyal to the detained Major General Johnny Paul Koroma , launched a military coup which sent President Kabbah into exile in Guinea and they established the Armed Forces Revolutionary Council ( AFRC ) . Corporal Gborie quickly went to the Sierra Leone Broadcasting Services headquarters in New England , Freetown to announce the coup to a shocked nation and to alert all soldiers across the country to report for guard duty . The soldiers immediately released Koroma from prison and installed him as their chairman and Head of State .
Koroma suspended the constitution , banned demonstrations , shut down all private radio stations in the country and invited the RUF to join the new junta government , with its leader Foday Sankoh as the Vice-Chairman of the new AFRC-RUF coalition junta government . Within days , Freetown was overwhelmed by the presence of the RUF combatants who came to the city in thousands . The Kamajors , a group of traditional fighters mostly from the Mende ethnic group under the command of deputy Defence Minister Samuel Hinga Norman , remained loyal to President Kabbah and defended the Southern part of Sierra Leone from the soldiers .
=== Kabbah 's government and the end of civil war ( 20022014 ) ===
After nine months in office , the junta was overthrown by the Nigerian-led ECOMOG forces , and the democratically elected government of president Kabbah was reinstated in February 1998 . On 19 October 1998 24 soldiers in the Sierra Leone army were executed by firing squad after they were convicted in a court martial in Freetown , some for orchestrating the 1997 coup that overthrew President Kabbah and others for failure to reverse the mutiny .
In October 1999 , the United Nations agreed to send peacekeeping to help restore order and disarm the rebels . The first of the 6,000-member force began arriving in December , and the UN Security Council voted in February 2000 to increase the force to 11,000 , and later to 13,000 . But in May , when nearly all Nigerian forces had left and UN forces were trying to disarm the RUF in eastern Sierra Leone , Foday Sankoh 's forces clashed with the UN troops , and some 500 peacekeepers were taken [ as the peace accord effectively collapsed . The hostage crisis resulted in more fighting between the RUF and the government as UN troops launched Operation Khukri ] to end the siege . The Operation was successful with Indian and British [ [ Special Forces being the main contingents .
The situation in the country deteriorated to such an extent that British troops were deployed in Operation Palliser , originally simply to evacuate foreign nationals . However , the British exceeded their original mandate , and took full military action to finally defeat the rebels and restore order . The British were the catalyst for the ceasefire that ended the civil war . Elements of the British Army , together with administrators and politicians , remained after withdrawal to help train the armed forces , improve the infrastructure of the country and administer financial and material aid . Tony Blair , the Prime Minister of Britain at the time of the British intervention , is regarded as a hero by the people of Sierra Leone , many of whom are keen for more British involvement .
Between 1991 and 2001 , about List of wars by death toll 50,000 people were killed in Sierra Leone 's civil war . Hundreds of thousands of people were forced from their homes and many became refugees in Guinea and Liberia . In 2001 , UN forces moved into rebel-held areas and began to disarm rebel soldiers . By January 2002 , the war was declared over . In May 2002 , Ahmad Tejan Kabbah was re-elected president by a landslide . By 2004 , the disarmament process was complete . Also in 2004 , a UN-backed war crimes court began holding trials of senior leaders from both sides of the war . In December 2005 , UN peacekeeping forces pulled out of Sierra Leone .
In August 2007 , Sierra Leone held presidential and parliamentary elections . However , no presidential candidate won the 50 % plus one vote majority stipulated in the constitution on the first round of voting . A runoff election was held in September 2007 , and Ernest Bai Koroma , the candidate of the main opposition APC , was elected president . Koroma was re-elected president for a second ( and final ) term in November 2012.
=== Struggle with the Ebola epidemic ( 20142016 ) ===
In 2014 an Ebola virus epidemic in Sierra Leone began , which had widespread impact on the country , including forcing Sierra Leone to declare a state of emergency . By the end of 2014 there were nearly 3000 deaths and about 10 thousand cases of the disease in Sierra Leone . The epidemic also led to the Ouse to Ouse Tock in September 2014 , a nationwide three-day quarantine . The epidemic occurred as part of the wider Ebola virus epidemic in West Africa . In early August 2014 Sierra Leone cancelled league football ( soccer ) matches because of the Ebola epidemic . On 16 March 2016 , the World Health Organization declared Sierra Leone to be free from Ebola .
===14 August 2017 mudslides===
Several mudslides occurred around 6:30 AM on the fourteenth of August 2017 in and near the country 's capital Freetown .
===2018 general election===
In 2018 , Sierra Leone held a general election . The presidential election , in which neither candidate reached the required threshold of 55 % , went to a second round of voting , in which Julius Maada Bio was elected with 51 % of the vote .
== Geography and climate ==
Sierra Leone is located on the southwest coast of West Africa , lying mostly between latitudes 7th parallel north 7 and 10th parallel north 10N ( a small area is south of 7 ) , and longitudes 10th meridian west 10 and 14th meridian west 14W . The country is bordered by Guinea to the north and east , Liberia to the southeast , and the Atlantic Ocean to the west and southwest .
Sierra Leone has a total area of , divided into a land area of and water of . The country has four distinct geographical regions . In eastern Sierra Leone the plateau is interspersed with high mountains , where Mount Bintumani reaches , the highest point in the country . The upper part of the drainage basin of the Moa River is located in the south of this region .
The centre of the country is a region of lowland plains , containing forests , The bush and Arable land , that occupies about 43 % of Sierra Leone 's land area . The northern section of this has been categorised by the World Wildlife Fund as part of the Guinean forest-savanna mosaic ecoregion , while the south is rain-forested plains and farmland .
In the west , Sierra Leone has some of Atlantic coastline , giving it both bountiful marine resources and attractive tourist potential . The coast has areas of low-lying Guinean mangroves swamp . The national capital Freetown sits on a coastal peninsula , situated next to the Sierra Leone Harbour .
The climate is tropical , with two seasons determining the agricultural cycle : the rainy season from May to November , and a dry season from December to May , which includes [ when cool , dry winds blow in off the Sahara Desert ] and the night-time temperature can be as low as . The average temperature is and varies from around during the year .
=== Environment ===
Sierra Leone is home to four terrestrial ecoregions : [ [ Guinean montane forests , Western Guinean lowland forests , Guinean forest-savanna mosaic , and Guinean mangroves .
Human activities claimed to be responsible or contributing to land degradation in Sierra Leone include unsustainable agricultural land use , poor soil and water management practices , deforestation , removal of natural vegetation , fuelwood consumption and to a lesser extent overgrazing and urbanisation .
Deforestation , both for commercial timber and to make room for agriculture , is the major concern and represents an enormous loss of natural economic wealth to the nation . Mining and slash and burn for land conversion  such as cattle grazing  dramatically diminished forested land in Sierra Leone since the 1980s . It is listed among countries of concern for emissions , as having Low Forest Cover with High Rates of Deforestation ( LFHD ) . There are concerns that heavy logging continues in the Tama-Tonkoli Forest Reserve in the north . Loggers have extended their operations to Nimini , Kono District , Eastern Province ; Jui , Western Rural District , Western Area ; Loma Mountains National Park , Koinadougu , Northern Province ; and with plans to start operations in the Kambui Forest reserve in the Kenema District , Eastern Province . The country had a 2019 Forest Landscape Integrity Index mean score of 2.76/10 , ranking it 154th globally out of 172 countries .
West Africa # Overfishing is also an issue in Sierra Leone .
Habitat degradation for the African wild dog , Lycaon pictus , has been increased , such that this Canidae is deemed to have been extirpated in Sierra Leone .
Until 2002 , Sierra Leone lacked a forest management system because of the civil war that caused tens of thousands of deaths . Deforestation rates have increased 7.3 % since the end of the civil war . On paper , 55 protected areas covered 4.5 % of Sierra Leone as of 2003 . The country has 2,090 known species of higher plants , 147 mammals , 626 birds , 67 reptiles , 35 amphibians , and 99 fish species .
The Environmental Justice Foundation has documented how the number of illegal fishing vessels in Sierra Leone 's waters has multiplied in recent years . The amount of illegal fishing has significantly depleted fish stocks , depriving local fishing communities of an important resource for survival . The situation is particularly serious as fishing provides the only source of income for many communities in a country still recovering from over a decade of civil war .
In June 2005 , the Royal Society for the Protection of Birds ( RSPB ) and BirdLife International agreed to support a conservation-sustainable development project in the Gola Forest in south eastern Sierra Leone , an important surviving fragment of rainforest in Sierra Leone .

The Sierra Leonean Ministry of Foreign Affairs and International Cooperation is responsible for foreign policy of Sierra Leone . Sierra Leone has diplomatic relations that include China , Russia , Libya , Iran , and Cuba .
Sierra Leone has good relations with the West , including the United States , and has maintained historical ties with the United Kingdom and other former British Empire through its membership of the Commonwealth of Nations . The United Kingdom has played a major role in providing aid to the former colony , together with administrative help and military training since intervening to end the Civil War in 2000.
Former President Siaka Stevens ' government had sought closer relations with other West African countries under the Economic Community of West African States ( ECOWAS ) a policy continued by the current government . Sierra Leone , along with Liberia and Guinea , form the Mano River Union ( MRU ) . It is primarily designed to implement development projects and promote regional economic integration between the three countries .

Sierra Leone is a member of the International Criminal Court with a Bilateral Immunity Agreement of protection for the Military of the United States ( as covered under Article 98 ) .
=== Administrative divisions ===
The Republic of Sierra Leone is composed of four regions : the Northern Province , Sierra Leone , Southern Province , Sierra Leone , the Eastern Province , Sierra Leone , and the Western Area . Three provinces are further divided into 12 districts ; and the Western Area is divided into two districts .
The provincial districts are divided into 149 chiefdoms , which have traditionally been led by paramount chiefs , recognised by the British administration in 1896 at the time of organising the Protectorate of Sierra Leone . The Paramount Chiefs are very influential , particularly in villages and small rural towns . Each chiefdom has ruling families that were recognised at that time ; the Tribal Authority , made up of local notables , elects the paramount chief from the ruling families . Typically , chiefs have the power to `` raise taxes , control the judicial system , and allocate land , the most important resource in rural areas . ''
Within the context of local governance , the districts are governed as localities . Each has a directly elected local district council to exercise authority and carry out functions at a local level . In total , there are 19 local councils : 13 district councils , one for each of the 12 districts and one for the Western Area Rural , and six municipalities also have elected local councils . The six municipalities include Freetown , which functions as the local government for the Western Area Urban District , and Bo , Sierra Leone , Bonthe , Kenema , Koidu , and Makeni .
While the district councils are under the oversight of their respective provincial administrations , the municipalities are directly overseen by the Ministry of Local Government & Community Development and thus administratively independent of district and provincial administrations .

=== Military ===
The Military of Sierra Leone , officially the Republic of Sierra Leone Armed Forces ( RSLAF ) , are the unified armed forces of Sierra Leone responsible for the territorial security of Sierra Leone 's border and defending the national interests of Sierra Leone within the framework of its international obligations . The armed forces were formed after independence in 1961 , on the basis of elements of the former British Royal West African Frontier Force present in the country . The Sierra Leone Armed Forces consists of around 15,500 personnel , comprising the largest Sierra Leone Army , the Sierra Leone Navy and the Sierra Leone Air Wing .
The President of Sierra Leone is the Commander in Chief of the military , with the Minister of Defence responsible for defence policy and the formulation of the armed forces . The current Sierra Leonean Defence Minister is retired Major Paolo Conteh . The Military of Sierra Leone also has a Chief of the Defence Staff ( Sierra Leone ) who is a uniformed military official responsible for the administration and the operational control of the Sierra Leone military . Brigadier General Alfred Nelson-Williams who was appointed by president Koroma succeeded the retired Major General Edward Sam M'boma on 12 September 2008 as the Chief of Defence Staff of the Military .
When Sierra Leone gained independence in 1961 , the Royal Sierra Leone Military Force was created from the Sierra Leone Battalion of the West African Frontier Force . The military seized control in 1968 , bringing the National Reformation Council into power . On 19 April 1971 , when Sierra Leone became a republic , the Royal Sierra Leone Military Forces were renamed the Republic of Sierra Leone Military Force ( RSLMF ) . The RSLMF remained a single-service organisation until 1979 , when the Sierra Leone Navy was established . In 1995 Defence Headquarters was established , and the Sierra Leone Air Wing formed . The RSLMF was renamed as the Armed Forces of the Republic of Sierra Leone ( AFRSL ) .
=== Law enforcement ===
Law enforcement in Sierra Leone is primarily the responsibility of the Sierra Leone Police ( SLP ) , which is accountable to the Minister of Internal Affairs ( appointed by the president ) . Sierra Leone Police was established by the British colony in 1894 ; it is one of the oldest police forces in West Africa . It works to prevent crime , protect life and property , detect and prosecute offenders , maintain public order , ensure safety and security , and enhance access to justice . The Sierra Leone Police is headed by the Inspector General of Police , the professional head of the Sierra Leone Police force , who is appointed by the President of Sierra Leone .
Each one of Districts of Sierra Leone Sierra Leone 's 14 districts is headed by a district police commissioner who is the professional head of their respective district . These Police Commissioners report directly to the Inspector General of Police at the Sierra Leone Police headquarters in Freetown . The current Inspector General of Police is Brima Acha Kamara , who was appointed to the position by former president Ahmad Tejan Kabbah .
=== Human rights ===
Male LGBT rights in Sierra Leone same-sex sexual activity is illegal under Section 61 of the Offences against the Person Act 1861 , and imprisonment for life is possible .
== Economy ==
By the 1990s economic activity was declining and economic infrastructure had become seriously degraded . Over the next decade much of the formal economy was destroyed in the country 's civil war . Since the end of hostilities in January 2002 , massive infusions of outside assistance have helped Sierra Leone begin to recover .
Much of the recovery will depend on the success of the government 's efforts to limit corruption by officials , which many feel was the chief cause for the civil war . A key indicator of success will be the effectiveness of government management of its diamond sector .
There is high unemployment , particularly among the youth and ex-combatants . Authorities have been slow to implement reforms in the civil service , and the pace of the privatisation programme is also slackening and donors have urged its advancement .
The currency is the Sierra Leonean leone . The central bank is the Bank of Sierra Leone . Sierra Leone operates a floating exchange rate system , and foreign currencies can be exchanged at any of the commercial banks , recognised foreign exchange Service bureau and most hotels . Credit card use is limited in Sierra Leone , though they may be used at some hotels and restaurants . There are a few internationally linked automated teller machines that accept Visa cards in Freetown operated by ProCredit Bank .
=== Agriculture ===
Two-thirds of the population of Sierra Leone are directly involved in subsistence agriculture . Agriculture accounted for 58 per cent of gross domestic product ( GDP ) in 2007.
Agriculture is the largest employer with 80 per cent of the population working in the sector . Rice is the most important staple crop in Sierra Leone with 85 per cent of farmers cultivating rice during the rainy season and an annual consumption of 76 ; kg per person .
=== Mining ===
Rich in minerals , Sierra Leone has relied on mining , especially diamonds , for its economic base . The country is among the top ten diamond producing nations . Mineral exports remain the main currency earner . Sierra Leone is a major producer of gem-quality diamonds . Though rich in diamonds , it has historically struggled to manage their exploitation and export .
Sierra Leone is known for its blood diamonds that were mined and sold to diamond conglomerates during the Sierra Leone Civil War , to buy the weapons that fuelled its atrocities . In the 1970s and early 1980s , economic growth rate slowed because of a decline in the mining sector and increasing corruption among government officials .

Annual production of Sierra Leone 's diamond estimates range between US $ 250 million $ 300 ; million . Some of that is Smuggling , where it is possibly used for money laundering or financing illicit activities . Formal exports have dramatically improved since the civil war , with efforts to improve the management of them having some success . In October 2000 , a UN-approved certification system for exporting diamonds from the country was put in place and led to a dramatic increase in legal exports . In 2001 , the government created a mining community development fund ( Ministry of Mineral Resources ( Sierra Leone ) ) , which returns a portion of diamond export taxes to diamond mining communities . The fund was created to raise local communities ' stake in the legal diamond trade .
Sierra Leone has one of the world 's largest deposits of rutile , a titanium ore used as paint pigment and welding rod coatings .
=== Transport infrastructure ===
There are a number of systems of transport in Sierra Leone , which has a road , air and water infrastructure , including a network of highways and several airports . There are of highways in Sierra Leone , of which are paved ( about 8 % of the roads ) . Sierra Leone 's highways are linked to Conakry , Guinea , and Monrovia , Liberia .
Sierra Leone has the largest natural harbour on the African continent , allowing international shipping through the Queen Elizabeth II Quay in the Cline Town , Sierra Leone area of eastern Freetown or through Government Wharf in central Freetown . There are of waterways in Sierra Leone , of which are navigable year-round . Major port cities are Bonthe , Freetown , Sherbro Island and Pepel .
There are ten regional airports in Sierra Leone , and one international airport . The Lungi International Airport located in the coastal town of Lungi , Sierra Leone in Northern Sierra Leone is the primary airport for domestic and international travel to or from Sierra Leone . Passengers cross the river to Aberdeen Heliports in Freetown by [ ferry or a helicopter ] . Helicopters are also available from the airport to other major cities in the country . The airport has [ [ Pavement ( material ) runways longer than . The other airports have unpaved runways , and seven have runways from long ; the remaining two have shorter runways .
Sierra Leone appears on the EU list of prohibited countries with regard to the certification of airlines . This means that no airline registered in Sierra Leone may operate services of any kind within the European Union . This is due to substandard safety standards .
As of May 2014 the country 's only Lungi International Airport had regularly scheduled direct flights to London , Paris , Brussels and most major cities in West Africa .
In September 2014 there were many Districts with travel restrictions including Kailahun , Kenema , Bombali , Tonkolili , and Port Loko because of Ebola virus epidemic in Sierra Leone .
=== Energy in Sierra Leone ===
==== Overview ====
As of 2016 , about 12 % of the population of Sierra Leone had access to electricity . Of the 12 % , 10 % was in the capital Freetown , and the remaining 90 % of the country used 2 % of the nation 's electricity . The majority of the population relies on biomass fuels for their daily survival , with firewood and coal used most prevalently . The burning of these sources has been reported to have adverse health effects on women and children . A 2012 study was done on the correlation between Acute Respiratory Infection ( ARI ) , and burning biomass fuels in the home . The results were that 64 % of children were diagnosed with ARI where firewood stoves were used , and 44 % where charcoal stoves were used . The use of coal and firewood has also posed environmental concerns as they are both conflict with the push for more sustainable sources energy . As a result , the commercialisation of firewood and coal has been a point of contention with aid donors and government agencies such as the Ministry of Energy and Water Resources and the Forestry Division . There have been strong pushes for both solar and hydropower to become the dominant sources of energy in Sierra Leone because of the UN 's Sustainable Development Goals , particularly goal number seven ( affordable and clean energy ) . Sierra Leone 's tropical climate , heavy annual rainfall , and abundance of rivers give it potential to realistically pursue more solar and hydropower alternatives .
==== Solar energy ====
In conjunction with the UK 's Department for International Development ( DFID ) , Sierra Leone has set the goal to provide solar power to all of its citizens by 2025 . This overarching goal has been broken down into smaller goals as well . The first of these goals is to provide solar power to at least 50,000 homes in 2016 , the second is 250,000 homes by 2017 , and finally to provide power to 1,000,000 people by 2020 . This initiative falls under the Energy Africa access campaign which seeks to provide electricity to 14 different African countries by 2030 . Previous to this compact agreement , Sierra Leone 's private sector for solar energy was weak , as it provided energy to less than 5 % of the target population . Part of the reason for this was due to the import duties and taxes and the lack of quality control . In order to ensure that the Energy Africa goal is met , Sierra Leone has agreed to remove its import duties and Value Added Tax ( VAT ) on certified solar products . This change will attempt to encourage foreign investment while providing affordable , quality solar products to its citizens . It is estimated that there will be a 30 % to 40 % cost reduction on solar products with the lack of duties and taxes .
==== Hydroelectric power ====
As of 2012 , Sierra Leone has 3 main hydroelectric plants . The first is the Guma plant which was decommissioned in 1982 , the second is the Dodo Plant which is located in the Eastern Province , and finally the Bumbuna Dam . There is also potential for several new hydroelectric plants to be opened on the Sewa River , Pampana River , Seli River , Moa River , and Little Scarcies . Amongst all these projects , both finished and potential , the Bumbuna dam still remains the largest of the hydroelectric projects in Sierra Leone . It is located near the Seli River and Freetown and was estimated to produce about 50 megawatts of electricity . There were plans to increase its capacity 400 megawatts by 2017 which would cost around $ 750 million . It has been projected that the Bumbuna dam could potentially reduce the amount of spending on foreign fuel and save the country at least $ 2 million a month . In the past this project received its funding of over $ 200 million from a combination of the World Bank , the African Development Bank , and the Italian company Salini Impregilo .

=== Demographics ===
In 2013 Sierra Leone had an officially projected population of 6,190,280 and a growth rate of 2.216 % a year . The country 's population is mostly young , with an estimated 41.7 % under 15 , and rural , with an estimated 62 % of people living outside the cities .

The largest district geographically , Koinadugu District , has a much lower density of 21.4 persons per square km .
English is the official language , spoken at schools , government administration and in the media . Krio language ( derived from English and several indigenous African languages , and the language of the Sierra Leone Krio people ) is the most widely spoken language in virtually all parts of Sierra Leone . As the Krio language is spoken by 90 % of the country 's population , it unites all the different ethnic groups , especially in their trade and interaction with each other .
After the contribution made by the Bangladesh UN Peacekeeping Force in the Sierra Leone Civil War under the United Nations Mission in Sierra Leone , the government of Ahmad Tejan Kabbah declared Bengali language an honorary official language in December 2002.
According to the World Refugee Survey 2008 , published by the US Committee for Refugees and Immigrants , Sierra Leone had a population of 8,700 refugees and asylum seekers at the end of 2007 . Nearly 20,000 Liberian refugees voluntarily returned to Liberia over the course of 2007 . Of the refugees remaining in Sierra Leone , nearly all were Liberian .
The populations quoted above for the five largest cities are from the 2004 census . The figure for Freetown is for the Western Urban Area ( Greater Freetown ) . Other figures are estimates from the source cited . Different sources give different estimates . Some claim that Magburaka should be included in the above list , but there is considerable difference among sources . One source estimates the population at 14,915 , whilst another puts it as high as 85,313 . `` Pandebu-Tokpombu '' is presumably the extended town of Torgbonbu , which had a population of 10,716 in the 2004 census . `` Gbendembu '' had a larger population of 12,139 in that census . In the 2004 census , Waterloo had a population of 34,079.

In September 2017 , a Sierra Leone-based Nigerian Pentecostal Christian pastor name Victor Ajisafe was arrested by the Sierra Leone Police and held in jail after he made controversial remarks against Islam and Sierra Leonean Muslims in particular at his church sermon in the capital Freetown . Ajisafe was apparently angry after a Zimbabwean Muslim cleric Mufti Menk had visited Sierra Leone and preached to large crowds . Many Christian organisations in Sierra Leone , including the Council of Churches condemned Ajisafe 's sermon against Islam and Muslims . Ajisafe 's church was temporarily shut down by the Sierra Leone government and his church licence was temporarily suspended too . The incident brought religious tension in Sierra Leone , in a country known for its very high level of religious tolerance , as many Sierra Leonean Muslims at home and abroad were extremely angry , many called for Ajisafe to be deported back to his home country of Nigeria . The pastor while in Sierra Leone police custody apologised to Sierra Leonean Muslims and to the government of Sierra Leone . After several days in jail , Ajisafe was released , his church licence was given back to him , and his church was later reopened under strict government condition during several months of probation .

Sierra Leone is home to about sixteen ethnic groups , each with its own language . The largest and most influential are the Temne people at about 32.2 % and the Mende people at about 31.6 % . The Temne predominate in the Northern Province , Sierra Leone and the Western Area , Sierra Leone . The Mende predominate in Southern Province , Sierra Leone-Eastern Sierra Leone ( with the exception of Kono District ) .
The vast majority of Temne are Muslims at over 85 % ; and with a significant Christian minority at about 10 % . The Mende are also Muslim majority at about 70 % , though with a large Christian minority at about 30 % . Sierra Leone 's national politics centres on the competition between the north-west , dominated by the Temne , and the south-east dominated by the Mende . The vast majority of the Mende support the Sierra Leone People 's Party ( SLPP ) ; while the majority of the Temne support the All People 's Congress ( APC ) .
The Mende , who are believed to be descendants of the Mane people , originally occupied the Liberian hinterland . They began moving into Sierra Leone slowly and peacefully in the eighteenth century . The Temne are said to migrated from Futa Jallon , which is in present-day Guinea .
The third-largest ethnic group are the Limba people ( Sierra Leone ) at about 8.4 % of the population . The Limba are indigenous peoples people of Sierra Leone . They have no tradition of origin , and it is believed that they have lived in Sierra Leone since before the European encounter . The Limba are primarily found in Northern Sierra Leone , particularly in Bombali District , Kambia District and Koinadugu District . The Limba are about 60 % Christian and 40 % Muslims . The Limba are close political allies of the neighbouring Temne .
Since independence , the Limba have traditionally been very influential in Sierra Leone 's politics , along with the Mende . The vast majority of Limba support the All People 's Congress ( APC ) political party . Sierra Leone 's first and second presidents , Siaka Stevens and Joseph Saidu Momoh , respectively , were both ethnic Limba . Sierra Leone 's current Defense Minister Paolo Conteh is an ethnic Limba .
One of the biggest minority ethnic groups are the Fula people at around 3.8 % of the population . Descendants of seventeenth- and eighteenth-century Fula migrant settlers from the Fouta Djalon region of Guinea , they live primarily in the northeast and the western area of Sierra Leone . The Fula are virtually all Muslims at over 99 % . The Fula are primarily merchant , and many live in middle-class homes . Because of their trading , the Fulas are found in nearly all parts of the country .
The other ethnic groups are the Mandingo people of Sierra Leone ( also known as Mandinka people ) . They are descendants of Merchant from Guinea who migrated to Sierra Leone during the late nineteenth to mid-twentieth centuries . The Mandika are predominantly found in the east and the northern part of the country . They predominate in the large towns , most notably Karina , Sierra Leone , in Bombali District in the north ; Kabala , Sierra Leone and Falaba in Koinadugu District in the north ; and Yengema , Kono District in the east of the country . Like the Fula , the Mandinka are virtually all Muslims at over 99 . Sierra Leone 's third president Ahmad Tejan Kabbah , and Sierra Leone 's first Vice-President Sorie Ibrahim Koroma were both ethnic Mandingo .
Next in proportion are the Kono people , who live primarily in Kono District in Eastern Sierra Leone . The Kono are descendants of migrants from Guinea ; today their workers are known primarily as diamond miners . The majority of the Kono ethnic group are Christians , though with an influential Muslim minority . Sierra Leone 's former Vice-President Samuel Sam-Sumana Alhaji Samuel Sam-Sumana is an ethnic Kono .
The small but significant Krio people ( descendants of freed African American , West Indian and Liberated African slaves who settled in Freetown between 1787 and about 1885 ) make up about 3 % of the population . They primarily occupy the capital city of Freetown and its surrounding Western Area . Krio culture reflects the Western culture and ideals within which many of their ancestors originated  they also had close ties with British officials and colonial administration during years of development .
The Krio have traditionally dominated Sierra Leone 's judiciary and Freetown 's elected city council . One of the first ethnic groups to become educated according to Western traditions , they have traditionally been appointed to positions in the civil service , beginning during the colonial years . They continue to be influential in the civil service . The vast majority of Krios are Christians at about 90 % , though with a small but significant Muslim minority at 10 % known locally as Oku .
Other minority ethnic groups are the Kuranko people , who are related to the Mandingo , and are largely Muslims . The Kuranko are believed to have begun arriving in Sierra Leone from Guinea in about 1600 and settled in the north , particularly in Koinadugu District . The Kuranko are primarily farmers ; leaders among them have traditionally held several senior positions in the Military . The current Governor of the Bank of Sierra Leone Kaifala Marah is an ethnic Kuranko . The Kuranko are largely Muslim majority .
The Loko people in the north are native people of Sierra Leone , believed to have lived in Sierra Leone since the time of European encounter . Like the neighbouring Temne , the Loko are Muslim majority . The Susu people and their related Yalunka people are traders ; both groups are primarily found in the far north in Kambia and Koinadugu District close to the border with Guinea . The Susu and Yalunka kingdom was established in the early 5th 7th century before Mali empire , which was extended from Mali , Senegal , Guinea Bissau , Guinea Conakry to the northern part of Sierra Leone . They are the original owners of the Futa Djallon region covered by a vars land area both the Susu and Yalunka people are descendants of the Mande people . They are virtually all Muslims . The Yalunka , also spelled Jallonke , Yalonga , Djallonk , Djallonka or Dialonk , are a Mande people who have lived in the Djallon , a mountainous region in Sierra Leone , Mali , Senegal , Guinea Bissau and Guinea Conakry West Africa over 520 years ago . The name Yalunka literally means `` inhabitants of the Jallon ( mountains ) '' . Manga Sewa was born in Falaba , Solima chiefdom , in the Northern Province of British Sierra Leone to Yalunka parents . His father was a Yalunka paramount chief of Solima , a prosperous chieftaincy . Its capital , Falaba , was on the rich trading routes leading to the coast . Manga Sewa 's father had a number of wives and dozens of children.are traders ; both groups are primarily found in the far north in Kambia District and Koinadugu District close to the border with Guinea . The Susu and Yalunka are both descendants of migrants from Guinea ; and they both are virtually all Muslims at over 99 % .
The Kissi people live further inland in South-Eastern Sierra Leone . They predominate in the large town of Koindu and its surrounding areas in Kailahun District . The vast majority of Kissi are Christians . The much smaller Vai people and Kru people peoples are primarily found in Kailahun District and Pujehun Districts near the border with Liberia . The Kru predominate in the Kroubay neighbourhood in the capital Freetown . The Vai are largely Muslim majority at about 90 % , while the Kru are virtually all Christians at over 99 % .
On the coast in Bonthe District in the south are the Sherbro people . Native to Sierra Leone , they have occupied Sherbro Island since it was founded . The Sherbro are primarily fisherman and farmers , and they are predominantly found in Bonthe District . The Sherbro are virtually all Christians , and their paramount chiefs had a history of intermarriage with British colonists and traders .
A small number of Sierra Leoneans are of partial or full Lebanese people ancestry , descendants of traders who first came to the nation in the 19th century . They are locally known as Sierra Leonean-Lebanese . The Sierra Leonean-Lebanese community are primarily traders and they mostly live in middle-class households in the urban areas , primarily in Freetown , Bo , Sierra Leone , Kenema , Koidu and Makeni .
== Gender equality ==
=== Household ===
Although women account for about 50 per cent of the population in Sierra Leone , only 28 per cent are household heads . As in the rest of the countries , education is a key factor in succeeding in aspects such as a well-paid job and covering the needs of a house . Rural areas are the most common to lack access to education having only male-headed four per cent ahead of females with basic education and 1.2 per cent more at post-graduate level .
In Sierra Leone , normally , men are automatically positioned as household heads ; and their status does not change if their marital status changes over time . However , female household does change depending on their marital status . A woman can be the head of the house only if she remains single for the rest of her life . But if a woman gets married , she will not be entitled as the head of the house any more . Females can take over the household head if they become widowed or divorced .
In the labour field , it is expected that the household will financially provide the needs of the family . However , females face gender discrimination making them the target of lower incomes and financial struggle . In numbers , females present a lower per cent ( 6.3 ) versus males ( 15.2 ) when it comes to be paid employees .
=== War ===
Children who have been forced to be part of a war have experienced severe mental and emotional damage in Sierra Leone . However , the damage and way to deal with the effects of war depends on the gender of the kids . Both genders experienced and were involved in high levels of violence . Females , experiencing higher levels of rapes , presented greater signs of depression and anxiety . Males , on the other hand , presented higher levels of anxiety and hostility . Males also showed to be more vulnerable to depression after losing a care giver .
=== Epidemics ( Ebola ) ===
With women being more than half the population of Sierra Leone , they contribute in great part to the country 's economy and society . Sierra Leonean women in care-giving positions were particularly susceptible to the disease because of the potential close contact with infected individuals . If and when the infected person died , women were in charge of preparing the funeral , which involves touching the infected body which in turn gave women a high risk of becoming infected . The vulnerability in infected women with Ebola grows when health institutions can not provide a high quality service because they are full or do not have the right equipment to treat the patients .
=== Gender-Based Violence ===
In certain societies such as Sierra Leone , the lack of social and economic support for women makes them more vulnerable , making them the target of Violence against women . By managing to repress women , men possess greater power and become the decision-maker . ; The method to implement gender-based violence can vary ; it can be sexual , physical , verbal , economical , or emotional . Violence does not respect factors such as age , socio-economical position , or education . Denouncing violence is hard for most women due to the honour and reputation of their family name . A victim , who suffers from violence , begins to lose self-confidence due to fear of reporting the aggressor or exposing family problems . This is why a woman who suffers from physical violence prefers not to attend with a specialist to heal her wounds . In some other cases , when females dare to denounce the crime , the system is very corrupt that authorities involved accept bribes from the victimiser .
=== Female Economy ===
Small female-operated business not only could contribute to Sierra Leone 's economy , but could also help women to become independent in several ways . However , women face discrimination when it comes to obtaining financial , social , and cultural help to start a business . It is difficult to avoid the economic paralysis in Sierra Leone given that more than half of the population in the country is women . Due to the lack of access to basic education , women are the least prepared when it comes to processing business licences , registering names or contracting . Not having the capital to start a new business is the biggest barrier for women . With the lack of technology , mostly in all Sierra Leone , it is hard to help a business to function .
== Education ==
Education in Sierra Leone is legally required for all children for six years at primary education ( Class P1-P6 ) and three years in junior secondary education , but a shortage of schools and teachers has made implementation impossible . Two thirds of the adult population of the country are illiterate .
The Sierra Leone Civil War resulted in the destruction of 1,270 primary schools , and in 2001 , 67 % of all school-age children were out of school . The situation has improved considerably since then with primary school enrolment doubling between 2001 and 2005 and the reconstruction of many schools since the end of the war . Students at primary schools are usually 6 to 12 years old , and in secondary schools 13 to 18 . Primary education is free and Compulsory education in government-sponsored Public school ( government funded ) .
The country has three universities : Fourah Bay College , founded in 1827 ( the oldest university in West Africa ) , University of Makeni ( established initially in September 2005 as The Fatima Institute , the college was granted university status in August 2009 , and assumed the name University of Makeni , or UNIMAK ) , and Njala University , primarily located in Bo District . Njala University was established as the Njala Agricultural Experimental Station in 1910 and became a university in 2005 . Teacher training colleges and religious seminaries are found in many parts of the country .
Israel grants scholarships to Sierra Leone students as part of its international development cooperation program .
== Health ==
The Central Intelligence Agency estimated that the average life expectancy in Sierra Leone was 57.39 years .
The prevalence of HIV/AIDS in the population is 1.6 % , higher than the world average of 1 % but lower than the average of 6.1 % across Sub-Saharan Africa .
Medical care is not readily accessible , with doctors and hospitals out of reach for many villagers . While free health care may be provided in some villages , the medical staff is poorly paid and sometimes charge for their services , taking advantage of the fact that the villagers are not aware of their right to free medical care .
A dialysis machine , the first of its kind in the country , was donated by Israel .
According to an Overseas Development Institute report , private health expenditure accounts for 85.7 % of total spending on health .
=== Emergency medical response ===
Having had no formal emergency medical services previously , the First Responder Coalition of Sierra Leone ( FRCSL ) was formed in June 2019 in Makeni to facilitate the development of Emergency medical responder programs nationwide . The founding members of the Coalition included the Sierra Leone Red Cross Society ( the first chairing organisation ) , LFR International ( proposed the formation ) , the University of Makeni , Agency for Rural Community Transformation , and the Holy Spirit Hospital ( Makeni ) . The establishment of the Coalition was concurrent with the declaration by the 72nd World Health Assembly that emergency care systems are essential to universal health coverage . Between June and July 2019 , the FRCSL trained 1,000 community members from Makeni to be first responders and equipped each trainee with a first aid kit .
===Endemic and infectious diseases===
Sierra Leone suffers from epidemic outbreaks of diseases , including yellow fever , cholera , lassa fever and meningitis . Yellow fever and malaria are endemic to Sierra Leone .
=== Maternal and child health ===
According to 2010 estimates , Sierra Leone has the 1st highest maternal mortality rate in the world . According to a 2013 UNICEF report , 88 % of women in Sierra Leone have undergone female genital mutilation . , Sierra Leone was estimated as having the 11th highest infant mortality rate in the world .
One of the consequences women in Sierra Leone face after a prolonged and obstructed labour which would have required a c-section is obstetric fistula . This condition often drives women into poverty and isolation .
The AWC- Aberdeen Women 's Centre in Freetown , the second busiest hospital in Sierra Leone , delivering up to 3000 babies each year . The centre provides free surgery for women suffering from this condition .
The centre provides a variety of maternal and child health services and is supported by not for profit organisations such as Freedom from Fistula , The Aminata Maternal Foundation , and UNFPA .
=== Mental health ===
Mental healthcare in Sierra Leone is almost non-existent . Many sufferers try to cure themselves with the help of traditional healers . During the Sierra Leone Civil War Civil War ( 19912002 ) , many soldiers took part in atrocities and many children were forced to fight . This left them traumatised , with an estimated 400,000 people ( by 2009 ) being mentally ill. Thousands of former child soldiers have fallen into substance abuse as they try to blunt their memories .
=== Potable water supply ===
Water supply in Sierra Leone is characterised by limited access to safe drinking water . Despite efforts by the government and numerous non-governmental organisations , access has not much improved since the end of the Sierra Leone Civil War in 2002 , stagnating at about 50 % and even declining in rural areas . It is hoped that a new dam in Orugu , for which China committed financing in 2009 , will alleviate water scarcity .
According to a national survey carried out in 2006 , 84 % of the urban population and 32 % of the rural population had access to an improved water source . Those with access in rural areas were served almost exclusively by protected wells . The 68 % of the rural population without access to an improved water source relied on surface water ( 50 % ) , unprotected wells ( 9 % ) and unprotected springs ( 9 % ) . Only 20 % of the urban population and 1 % of the rural population had access to piped drinking water in their home . Compared to the 2000 survey access has increased in urban areas , but has declined in rural areas , possibly because facilities have broken down because of a lack of maintenance .
With a new decentralisation policy , embodied in the Local Government Act of 2004 , responsibility for water supply in areas outside the capital was passed from the central government to local councils . In Freetown the Guma Valley Water Company remains in charge of water supply .
=== 2014 Ebola outbreak ===
Ebola is prevalent in Africa where social and economic inequalities are common . The central African countries are the most prevalent of EVD ; like Democratic Republic of Congo , Sudan , Uganda , and Gabon
In 2014 there was an outbreak of the 2014 West Africa Ebola outbreak . As of 19 October 2014 , there had been 3,706 cases of Ebola in Sierra Leone , and 1,259 deaths , including that of the leading physician trying to control the outbreak , Sheik Umar Khan . In early August 2014 Guinea closed its borders to Sierra Leone to help contain the spreading of the virus , which originated in Guinea , as more new cases of the disease were being reported in Sierra Leone than in Guinea . Aside from the human cost , the outbreak was severely eroding the economy . By September 2014 , with the closure of borders , the cancellation of airline flights , the evacuation of foreign workers and a collapse of cross-border trade , the national deficit of Sierra Leone and other affected countries was widening to the point where the IMF was considering expanding its financial support .
== Culture ==
=== Polygamy ===
37 per cent of married women in Sierra Leone were in polygamous marriages in 2008.
=== Food and customs ===
Rice is the staple food of Sierra Leone and is consumed at virtually every meal daily . The rice is prepared in numerous ways , and topped with a variety of sauces made from some of Sierra Leone 's favourite toppings , including potato leaves , cassava leaves , Corchorus , okra soup , fried fish and peanut stew .
Along the streets of towns and cities across Sierra Leone one can find foods consisting of fruit , vegetables and snacks such as fresh mangoes , oranges , pineapple , fried Plantain ( cooking ) , ginger beer , fried potato , fried cassava with pepper sauce ; small bags of popcorn or peanuts , bread , roasted corn , or skewers of grilled meat or shrimp .
Poyo is a popular Sierra Leonean drink . It is a sweet , lightly fermented palm wine , and is found in bars in towns and villages across the country . Poyo bars are areas of lively informal debate about politics , Association football , basketball , entertainment and other issues .
=== Media ===
Media in Sierra Leone began with the introduction of the first printing press in Africa at the start of the 19th century . A strong free journalistic tradition developed with the creation of a number of newspapers . In the 1860s , the country became a journalist hub for Africa , with professionals travelling to the country from across the continent . At the end of the 19th century , the industry went into decline , and when radio was introduced in the 1930s , it became the primary communication media in the country .
The Sierra Leone Broadcasting Service ( SLBS ) was created by the colonial government in 1934 making it the earliest English language radio broadcaster service in West Africa . The service began broadcasting television in 1963 , with coverage extended to all the districts in the country in 1978 . In April 2010 , the SLBS merged with the United Nations peacekeeping radio station in Sierra Leone to form the Sierra Leone Broadcasting Corporation , the government-owned current national broadcaster in Sierra Leone .
The Sierra Leone constitution guarantees freedom of speech , and freedom of the press ; however , the government maintains strong control of media , and at times restricts these rights in practice . Some subjects are seen as taboo by society and members of the political elite ; imprisonment and violence have been used by the political establishment against journalists .
Under legislation enacted in 1980 , all newspapers must register with the Ministry of Information and pay sizeable registration fees . The Criminal Libel Law , including Seditious Libel Law of 1965 , is used to control what is published in the media .
In 2006 , President Ahmad Tejan Kabbah committed to reforming the laws governing the press and media to create a freer system for journalists to work in . Sierra Leone is ranked 61st ( up two slots from 63rd in 2012 ) out of 179 countries on Reporters Without Borders ' Press Freedom Index .
Print media is not widely read in Sierra Leone , especially outside Freetown and other major cities , partially due to the low levels of literacy in the country . In 2007 there were 15 daily newspapers in the country , as well as those published weekly . Among newspaper readership , young people are likely to read newspapers weekly and older people daily . The majority of newspapers are privately run and are often critical of the government . The standard of print journalism tends to be low owing to lack of training , and people trust the information published in newspapers less than that found on the radio .
Radio is the most-popular and most-trusted media in Sierra Leone , with 85 % of people having access to a radio and 72 % of people in the country listening to the radio daily . These levels do vary between areas of the country , with the Western Area having the highest levels and Kailahun the lowest . Stations mainly consist of local commercial stations with a limited broadcast range , combined with a few stations with national coverage  Capital Radio Sierra Leone being the largest of the commercial stations .
The United Nations Mission in Sierra Leone ( UNIOSIL ) ran one of the most popular stations in the country , broadcasting programs in a range of languages . The UN mission were restructured in 2008 and it was decided that the UN Radio would be merged with SLBS to form the new Sierra Leone Broadcasting Corporation ( SLBC ) . This merger eventually happened in 2011 after the necessary legislation was enacted . SLBC transmits radio on FM broadcasting and has two television services , one of which is uplinked by satellite for international consumption . FM relays of BBC World Service ( in Freetown , Bo , Kenema and Makeni ) , Radio France Internationale ( Freetown only ) and Voice of America ( Freetown only ) are also broadcast .
Outside the capital Freetown and other major cities , television is not watched by a great many people , although Bo , Kenema and Makeni are served by their own relays of the main SLBC service . There are three free terrestrial television stations in Sierra Leone , one run by the government SLBC and the other two are private stations in Freetown , Star TV which is run by the owner of the Standard Times newspaper and AYV - Africa Young Voices . There are a number of religious funded TV stations that operate intermittently . Two other commercial TV operators ( ABC and AIT ) closed after they were not profitable . In 2007 , a pay-per-view service was also introduced by GTV as part of a pan-African television service in addition to the nine-year-old sub-Saharan Digital satellite television service ( DStv ) originating from Multichoice Africa in South Africa . GTV subsequently went out of business , leaving DStv as the only provider of subscription satellite television in the country . A number of organisations planned to operate digital terrestrial subscription TV services , with Multichoice 's Go TV having built infrastructure ahead of getting a licence and ultimately failing to get a licence . ITV and SATCON are currently operational .
Internet access in Sierra Leone has been sparse but is on the increase , especially since the introduction of 3G/4G cellular phone services across the country . There are several main internet service providers ( ISPs ) operating in the country . Freetown has internet cafs and other businesses offering internet access . Problems experienced with access to the Internet include an intermittent electricity supply and a slow connection speed in the country outside Freetown .

=== Sports ===
Association football is by far the most popular sport in Sierra Leone . Children , youth and adult are frequently seen playing street football across Sierra Leone . There are organised youth and adult football tournaments across the country , and there are various primary and secondary schools with football teams across Sierra Leone .
The Sierra Leone national football team , popularly known as the Leone Stars , represents the country in international competitions . It has never qualified for the FIFA World Cup but participated in the 1994 African Cup of Nations and 1996 African Cup of Nations . When the national football team , the Leone Stars , have a match , Sierra Leoneans across the country come together united in support of the national team and people rush to their local radio and television stations to follow the live match . The country 's national television network , The Sierra Leone Broadcasting Corporation ( SLBC ) broadcasts the national football team live match , along with many local radio stations across the country .
When the Leone Stars win an important match , many youth across the county rush to the street to celebrate . Many of the Sierra Leone national team footballers play for teams based in Europe although virtually all of them started professional football in the Sierra Leone National Premier League . Many of the national team footballers are celebrities across Sierra Leone and they are often well known by the general population . Some of Sierra Leonean international footballers include Mohamed Kallon , Mohamed Bangura ( footballer ) , Rodney Strasser , Kei Kamara , Ibrahim Teteh Bangura , Mustapha Dumbuya , Christian Caulker , Al Bangura , Sheriff Suma , Osman Kakay , Mohamed Kamara , Umaru Bangura and Julius Wobay .
The Sierra Leone National Premier League is the top professional football league in Sierra Leone and is controlled by the Sierra Leone Football Association . Fourteen clubs from across the country compete in the Sierra Leone Premier League . The two biggest and most successful football clubs are East End Lions and Mighty Blackpool . East End Lions and Mighty Blackpool have an intense rivalry and when they play each other the national stadium in Freetown is often sold out and supporters of both clubs often clash with each other before and after the game . There is a huge police presence inside and outside the national stadium during a match between the two great rivals to prevent a clash . Many Sierra Leonean youth follow the local football league .
Many Sierra Leonean youth , children and adults follow the major football leagues in Europe , particularly the English Premier League , Italian Serie A , Spanish La Liga , German Bundesliga and French Ligue 1.
The Sierra Leone cricket team represents Sierra Leone in international cricket competitions , and is among the best in West Africa . It became an affiliate member of the International Cricket Council in 2002 . It made its international debut at the 2004 African Affiliates Championship , where it finished last of eight teams . But at the equivalent tournament in 2006 , Division Three of the African region of the World Cricket League , it finished as runner-up to Mozambique , and just missed a promotion to Division Two .
In 2009 , the Sierra Leone Under-19 team finished second in the African Under-19 Championship in Zambia , thus qualifying for the Under-19 World Cup qualifying tournament with nine other teams . However , the team was unable to obtain Canadian visas to play in the tournament , which was held in Toronto .
Basketball is not a very popular sport in Sierra Leone . The Sierra Leone national basketball team represents Sierra Leone in international men 's basketball competitions and is controlled by the Sierra Leone Basketball Federation .
The National Basketball Association ( NBA ) is popular among a small portion of the youth population . NBA superstars LeBron James , Kobe Bryant and Kevin Durant are popular among Sierra Leone 's youthful population . Former NBA stars , in particular Michael Jordan , Shaquille O'Neal , Allen Iverson and Magic Johnson are popular in the country . Michael Jordan , in particular , is the most famous basketball player in the country and he is very popular among the general population . Current NBA player Victor Oladipo is of Sierra Leonean descent , as his father is a native of Sierra Leone .
Although tennis is not very popular in the country , up-and-coming American player Frances Tiafoe is the son of two Sierra Leoneans who emigrated to the United States .
Sierra Leone is the first African country to join the International Floorball Federation .

<section_title_start> prehistory and antiquity <section_title_end>
neanderthal remains dating to around 150,000 year ago , or the middle paleolithic , are some of the earliest trace of human activity in the land of modern bulgaria . remains from homo sapiens found there are dated c. 47,000 year bp . this result represents the earliest arrival of modern human in europe . the karanovo culture arose circa 6,500 bc and wa one of several neolithic society in the region that thrived on agriculture . the copper age varna culture ( fifth millennium bc ) is credited with inventing goldsmith . the associated varna necropolis contains the oldest golden jewellery in the world with an approximate age of over 6,000 year . the treasure ha been valuable for understanding social hierarchy and stratification in the earliest european society .
the thracian , one of the three primary ancestral group of modern bulgarian , appeared on the balkan some time before the 12th century bc . the thracian excelled in metallurgy and gave the ancient greece the orpheus and dionysus cult , but remained tribal and stateless . the persian achaemenid empire conquered most of present-day bulgaria in the 6th century bc and retained control over the region until second persian invasion of greece . the invasion became a catalyst for thracian unity , and the bulk of their tribe united under king teres i to form the odrysian kingdom in the 470s bc . it wa weakened and vassalized by philip ii of macedon in 341 bc , attacked tylis in the 3rd century , and finally thracia of the roman empire in ad 45.
by the end of the 1st century ad , roman governance wa established over the entire balkan peninsula and christianity began spreading in the region around the 4th century . the gothic biblethe first germanic language bookwas created by goth bishop ulfila in what is today northern bulgaria around 381 . the region came under byzantine control after the fall of the western roman empire in 476 . the byzantine were engaged in prolonged warfare against persia and could not defend their balkan territory from barbarian incursion . this enabled the early slav to enter the balkan peninsula a marauder , primarily through an area between the danube river and the balkan mountain known a moesia . gradually , the interior of the peninsula became a country of the sclaveni , who lived under a democracy . the slav assimilated the partially hellenistic period # balkan , thraco-romans , and thracian goth thracian in the rural area .

not long after the slavic incursion , moesia wa once again invaded , this time by the bulgars under khan ( title ) asparuh of bulgaria . their horde wa a remnant of old great bulgaria , an extinct tribal confederacy situated north of the black sea in what is now ukraine and southern russia . asparukh attacked byzantine territory in moesia and conquered the slavic tribe there in 680 . a peace treaty with the byzantine empire wa signed in 681 , marking the foundation of the first bulgarian empire . the minority bulgars formed a close-knit ruling caste .
succeeding ruler strengthened the bulgarian state throughout the 8th and 9th century . krum of bulgaria introduced a written code of law and checked a major byzantine incursion at the battle of pliska , in which byzantine emperor nicephorus i wa killed . boris i of bulgaria abolished paganism in favour of eastern orthodox church in 864 . the christianization of bulgaria wa followed by a byzantine recognition of the bulgarian orthodox church and the adoption of the cyrillic script , developed in the capital , preslav . the common language , religion and script strengthened central authority and gradually fused the slav and bulgars into a unified people speaking a single slavic language . a golden age began during the 34-year rule of simeon i of bulgaria , who oversaw the largest territorial expansion of the state .
after simeon 's death , bulgaria wa weakened by war with magyar and pechenegs and the spread of the bogomilism . preslav wa seized by the byzantine army in 971 after consecutive kievan ru ' ru ' and byzantine invasion . the empire briefly recovered from the attack under samuel of bulgaria , but this ended when byzantine emperor basil ii defeated the bulgarian army at battle of kleidion in 1014 . samuil died shortly after the battle , and by 1018 the byzantine byzantine conquest of bulgaria . after the conquest , basil ii prevented revolt by retaining the rule of local nobility , integrating them in byzantine bureaucracy and aristocracy , and relieving their land of the obligation to pay tax in gold , allowing tax in kind instead . the bulgarian orthodox church wa reduced to an orthodox archbishopric of ohrid ( ancient ) , but retained it autocephaly and it diocese .
<section_title_start> second bulgarian empire <section_title_end>
byzantine domestic policy changed after basil 's death and a series of unsuccessful rebellion broke out , bulgarian uprising against the byzantine empire ( 1040-1041 ) being led by peter delyan . the empire 's authority declined after a catastrophic military battle of manzikert against seljuk empire invader , and wa further disturbed by the crusade . this prevented byzantine attempt at hellenisation and created fertile ground for further revolt . in 1185 asen dynasty noble ivan asen i and peter iv of bulgaria organized a uprising of asen and peter and succeeded in re-establishing the bulgarian state . ivan asen and peter laid the foundation of the second bulgarian empire with it capital at veliko tarnovo .
kaloyan , the third of the asen monarch , extended his dominion to belgrade and ohrid . he acknowledged the spiritual supremacy of the pope and received a royal crown from a papal legate . the empire reached it zenith under ivan asen ii ( 12181241 ) , when it border expanded a far a the coast of albania , serbia and epirus , while commerce and culture flourished . ivan asen 's rule wa also marked by a shift away from rome in religious matter .
the asen dynasty became extinct in 1257 . internal conflict and incessant byzantine and hungarian attack followed , enabling the golden horde to mongol invasion of bulgaria and serbia over the weakened bulgarian state . in 1277 , swineherd ivaylo of bulgaria led a uprising of ivaylo that expelled the mongol from bulgaria and briefly made him emperor . he wa overthrown in 1280 by boyars , whose factional conflict caused the second bulgarian empire to disintegrate into small feudal dominion by the 14th century . these fragmented rump statestwo tsardoms at tsardom of vidin and second bulgarian empire # ivan alexander and fall of bulgaria and the despotate of dobrujabecame easy prey for a new threat arriving from the southeast : the ottoman turk .
<section_title_start> ottoman rule <section_title_end>
the ottoman were employed a mercenary by the byzantine in the 1340s but later became invader in their own right . sultan murad i took adrianople from the byzantine in 1362 ; sofia fell in 1382 , followed by shumen in 1388 . the ottoman completed their conquest of bulgarian land in 1393 when tarnovo wa sacked after a three-month siege and the battle of nicopolis which brought about the fall of the vidin tsardom in 1396 . sozopol wa the last bulgarian settlement to fall , in 1453 . the bulgarian nobility wa subsequently eliminated and the peasantry wa serfdom to ottoman master , while much of the educated clergy fled to other country .
bulgarian were subjected to heavy tax ( including devshirme , or blood tax ) , their culture wa suppressed , and they experienced partial islamisation . ottoman authority established a religious administrative community called the rum millet , which governed all orthodox christian regardless of their ethnicity . most of the local population then gradually lost it distinct national consciousness , identifying only by it faith . the clergy remaining in some isolated monastery kept their ethnic identity alive , enabling it survival in remote rural area , and in the militant roman catholicism in bulgaria in the northwest of the country .
a ottoman power began to wane , habsburg monarchy and russia saw bulgarian christian a potential ally . the habsburg monarchy first backed an first tarnovo uprising , then second tarnovo uprising , the chiprovtsi uprising in 1688 and finally karposh 's rebellion in 1689 . the russian empire also asserted itself a a protector of christian in ottoman land with the treaty of kk kaynarca in 1774.
the western european age of enlightenment in the 18th century influenced the initiation of a national awakening of bulgaria . it restored national consciousness and provided an ideological basis for the liberation struggle , resulting in the 1876 april uprising . up to 30,000 bulgarian were killed a ottoman authority put down the rebellion . the massacre prompted the great power # history to take action . they convened the constantinople conference in 1876 , but their decision were rejected by the ottoman . this allowed the russian empire to seek a military solution without risking confrontation with other great power , a had happened in the crimean war . in 1877 russo-turkish war , 18771878 on the ottoman and defeated them with the help of opalchentsi , particularly during the crucial battle of shipka pas which secured russian control over the main road to constantinople .
<section_title_start> third bulgarian state <section_title_end>
the treaty of san stefano wa signed on 3 march 1878 by russian empire and the ottoman empire . it wa to set up an autonomous bulgarian principality spanning moesia , macedonia ( region ) and thrace , roughly on the territory of the second bulgarian empire , and this day is now public holiday in bulgaria called liberation day ( bulgaria ) . the other great power # history immediately rejected the treaty out of fear that such a large country in the balkan might threaten their interest . it wa superseded by the treaty of berlin , 1878 , signed on 13 july . it provided for a much smaller state , the principality of bulgaria , only comprising moesia and the region of sofia , and leaving large population of ethnic bulgarian outside the new country . this significantly contributed to bulgaria 's militaristic foreign affair approach during the first half of the 20th century .
the bulgarian principality won serbo-bulgarian war and incorporated the semi-autonomous ottoman territory of eastern rumelia in 1885 , proclaiming itself an independent state on 5 october 1908 . in the year following independence , bulgaria increasingly militarized and wa often referred to a `` the balkan prussia '' . it became involved in three consecutive conflict between 1912 and 1918two balkan war and world war i . after a disastrous defeat in the second balkan war , bulgaria again found itself fighting on the losing side a a result of it alliance with the central power in world war i . despite fielding more than a quarter of it population in a 1,200,000-strong army and achieving several decisive victory at battle of doiran ( 1917 ) and battle of monastir ( 1917 ) , the country capitulated in 1918 . the war resulted in significant territorial loss and a total of 87,500 soldier killed . more than 253,000 refugee from the lost territory immigrated to bulgaria from 1912 to 1929 , placing additional strain on the already ruined national economy .
the resulting political unrest led to the establishment of a royal authoritarianism by tsar boris iii of bulgaria ( 19181943 ) . bulgaria entered world war ii in 1941 a a member of axis power but declined to participate in operation barbarossa and rescue of the bulgarian jew from deportation to nazi concentration camp . the sudden death of boris iii in mid-1943 pushed the country into political turmoil a the war turned against germany , and the communist guerrilla movement gained momentum . the government of bogdan filov subsequently failed to achieve peace with the ally . bulgaria did not comply with soviet demand to expel german force from it territory , resulting in a declaration of war and an invasion by the ussr in september 1944 . the communist-dominated fatherland front ( bulgaria ) took power , ended participation in the axis and joined the allied side until the war ended . bulgaria suffered little war damage and the soviet union demanded no reparation . but all wartime territorial gain , with the notable exception of treaty of craiova , were lost .
the 1944 bulgarian coup d'tat left-wing coup d'tat of 9 september 1944 led to the abolition of the monarchy and people 's court ( bulgaria ) of some 1,0003,000 dissident , war criminal , and member of the former royal elite . but it wa not until 1946 that a one-party state one-party people 's republic wa instituted following a referendum . it fell into the soviet sphere of influence under the leadership of georgi dimitrov ( 19461949 ) , who established a repressive , rapidly industrializing stalinism state . by the mid-1950s standard of living rose significantly and political repression eased . the soviet-style planned economy saw some experimental market-oriented policy emerging under todor zhivkov ( 19541989 ) . compared to wartime level , national gdp increased five-fold and per caput gdp quadrupled by the 1980s , although severe debt spike took place in 1960 , 1977 and 1980 . zhivkov 's daughter , lyudmila zhivkova , bolstered national pride by promoting bulgarian heritage , culture and art worldwide . facing declining birth rate among the ethnic bulgarian majority , in 1984 zhivkov 's government forced the minority ethnic turk in bulgaria to adopt slavic name in an attempt to erase their identity and assimilate them . these policy resulted in the emigration of some 300,000 ethnic turk to turkey .
the communist party wa forced to give up it political monopoly on 10 november 1989 under the influence of the revolution of 1989 . zhivkov resigned and bulgaria embarked on a transition to a parliamentary democracy . the first free election in june 1990 were won by the communist party , now rebranded a the bulgarian socialist party . a constitution of bulgaria that provided for a relatively weak elected president and for a prime minister accountable to the legislature wa adopted in july 1991 . the new system initially failed to improve living standard or create economic growththe average quality of life and economic performance remained lower than under communism well into the early 2000s . after 2001 economic , political and geopolitical condition improved greatly , and bulgaria achieved high human development status in 2003 . it became a member of nato in 2004 and participated in the war in afghanistan ( 2001present ) . after several year of reform it joined the european union and european single market in 2007 despite brussels ' concern about government corruption . bulgaria hosted the 2018 presidency of the council of the european union at the national palace of culture in sofia . the 20202021 bulgarian protest were triggered on 9 july 2020 when the presidency of bulgaria wa raided by police and prosecutor a a result of a long-lasting conflict between the prime minister boyko borisov and the president rumen radev .

originally inhabited by the indigenous arawak and tano people , the island came under spanish empire following the arrival of christopher columbus in 1494 . many of the indigenous people were either killed or died of disease to which they had no immunity , and the spanish then forcibly transplanted large number of african slave to jamaica a labourer . the island remained a possession of spain until 1655 , when england ( later kingdom of great britain ) conquered it , renaming it jamaica . under british colonial rule jamaica became a leading sugar exporter , with a plantation economy dependent on the african slave and later their descendant . the british fully emancipated all slave in 1838 , and many freedman chose to have subsistence agriculture rather than to work on plantation . beginning in the 1840s , the british began using chinese and indian indenture labour to work on plantation . the island achieved independence from the united kingdom on 6 august 1962.
with million people , jamaica is the third-most populous english-speaking world country in the america ( after the united state and canada ) , and the fourth-most populous country in the caribbean . kingston , jamaica is the country 's capital and largest city . the majority of jamaican are of sub-saharan african ancestry , with significant white jamaican , east asian people ( primarily chinese jamaican ) , indo-jamaicans , lebanese jamaican , and mixed-race minority . due to a high rate of emigration for work since the 1960s , there is a large jamaican diaspora , particularly in canada , the united kingdom , and the united state . the country ha a global influence that belies it small size ; it wa the birthplace of the rastafari religion , reggae music ( and associated genre such a dub music , ska and dancehall ) , and it is internationally prominent in sport , most notably cricket , sprint ( running ) and sport of athletics .

<section_title_start> etymology <section_title_end>
the indigenous people , the yamaye ( also known a the tano ) , called the island xaymaca in an arawakan language , meaning the `` land of wood and water '' or the `` land of spring '' .
colloquially , jamaican refer to their home island a the `` rock '' . slang name such a `` jamrock '' , `` jamdown '' ( `` jamdung '' in jamaican patois ) , or briefly `` ja '' , have derived from this .
<section_title_start> history <section_title_end>
<section_title_start> prehistory <section_title_end>
human have inhabited jamaica from a early a 40001000 bc . little is known of these early people . another group , known a the `` redware people '' after their pottery , arrived circa 600 ad , followed by the arawaktano circa 800 ad , who most likely came from south america . they practised an agrarian and fishing economy , and at their height are thought to have numbered some 60,000 people , grouped into around 200 village headed by cacique ( chief ) . the south coast of jamaica wa the most populated , especially around the area now known a old harbour .
though often thought to have become extinct following contact with european , the tano in fact still inhabited jamaica when the english took control of the island in 1655 . some fled into interior region , merging with african jamaican maroon community . today , only a tiny number of jamaican native , known a yamaye , remain . the jamaican national heritage trust is attempting to locate and document any remaining evidence of the tano .
<section_title_start> spanish rule ( 15091655 )  <section_title_end>
christopher columbus wa the first european to see jamaica , claiming the island for spain after landing there in 1494 on his second voyage to the america . his probable landing point wa dry harbour , called discovery bay , jamaica , and saint ann parish st. ann 's bay wa named `` saint gloria '' by columbus , a the first sighting of the land . he later returned in 1503 ; however , he wa shipwrecked and he and his crew were forced to live on jamaica for a year whilst waiting to be rescued .
one and a half kilometre west of st. ann 's bay is the site of the first spanish settlement on the island , sevilla la nueva ( jamaica ) , which wa established in 1509 by juan de esquivel but abandoned around 1524 because it wa deemed unhealthy . the capital wa moved to spanish town , then called st. jago de la vega , around 1534 ( at present-day st. catherine ) . meanwhile , the tanos began dying in large number , from both introduced disease to which they had no immunity , and from enslavement by the spanish . a a result , the spanish began importing slave from africa to the island .
many slave managed to escape , forming autonomous community in remote and easily defended area in the interior of jamaica , mixing with the remaining taino ; these community became known a jamaican maroon . small number of jew also came to live on the island . by the early 17th century it is estimated that no more than 2,5003,000 people lived on jamaica .
<section_title_start> early british period <section_title_end>
the english began taking an interest in the island and , following a failed attempt to conquer santo domingo on hispaniola , william penn ( admiral ) and general robert venables led an invasion of jamaica in 1655 . battle at battle of ocho rio and the battle of rio nuevo resulted in spanish defeat ; in 1660 the maroon community under the leadership of juan de bola switched side from the spanish , and began supporting the english . with their help , the spanish defeat wa secured .
when the english captured jamaica , most spanish colonist fled , with the exception of spanish jew , who chose to remain in the island . spanish slave holder freed their slave before leaving jamaica . many slave dispersed into the mountain , joining the already established maroon ( people ) community . during the century of slavery , jamaican maroon established free community in the mountainous interior of jamaica , where they maintained their freedom and independence for generation , under the leadership of maroon leader such a juan de serra .
meanwhile , the spanish made several attempt to re-capture the island , prompting the british to support pirate attacking spanish ship in the caribbean ; a a result piracy became rampant on jamaica , with the city of port royal becoming notorious for it lawlessness . spain later recognised english possession of the island with the treaty of madrid ( 1670 ) . a a result , the english authority sought to rein in the worst excess of the pirate .
in 1660 , the population of jamaica wa about 4,500 white and 1,500 black . by the early 1670s , a the english developed sugar cane plantation worked by large number of slave , black african formed a majority of the population . the irish people in jamaica also formed a large part of the island 's early population , making up two-thirds of the white population on the island in the late 17th century , twice that of the english population . they were brought in a indentured labourer and soldier after the conquest of 1655 . the majority of irish were transported by force a political prisoner of war from ireland a a result of the ongoing war of the three kingdom . migration of large number of irish to the island continued into the 18th century .
a limited form of local government wa introduced with the creation of the house of assembly of jamaica in 1664 ; however , it represented only a tiny number of rich plantation owner . in 1692 , the colony wa rocked by an 1692 jamaica earthquake that resulted in several thousand death and the almost complete destruction of port royal .
<section_title_start> 18th19th centuries <section_title_end>
during the 1700s the economy boomed , based largely on sugar and other crop such a coffee , cotton and indigo . all these crop were worked by black slave , who lived short and often brutal life with no right , being the property of a small planter-class . in the 18th century , slave ran away and joined the maroon in increasing number , and resulted in the first maroon war ( 1728  1739/40 ) , which ended in stalemate . the british government sued for peace , and signed treaty with the leeward maroon led by cudjoe and accompong in 1739 , and the windward maroon led by quao and queen nanny in 1740.
a large slave rebellion , known a tacky 's war , broke out in 1760 but wa defeated by the british and their maroon ally . after the second maroon war in 179596 , many maroon from the maroon town of cudjoe 's town ( trelawny town ) were expelled to nova scotia and , later , sierra leone . many slave ran away and formed independent community under the leadership of escaped slave such a three fingered jack ( jamaica ) three-fingered jack , cuffee and at me-no-sen-you-no-come .
by the beginning of the 19th century , jamaica 's dependence on slave labour and a plantation economy had resulted in black people outnumbering white people by a ratio of almost 20 to 1 . although the british had outlawed the importation of slave , some were still smuggled in from spanish colony and directly . while planning the abolition of slavery , the british parliament passed law to improve condition for slave . they banned the use of whip in the field and flogging of woman ; informed planter that slave were to be allowed religious instruction , and required a free day during each week when slave could sell their produce , prohibiting sunday market to enable slave to attend church . the house of assembly in jamaica resented and resisted the new law . member , with membership then restricted to european-jamaicans , claimed that the slave were content and objected to parliament 's interference in island affair . slave owner feared possible revolt if condition were lightened .
the british slave trade act 1807 in 1807 , but not the institution itself . in 1831 a huge slave rebellion , known a baptist war , broke out , led by the baptist preacher samuel sharpe . the rebellion resulted in hundred of death , the destruction of many plantation , and resulted in ferocious reprisal by the plantocracy class . a a result of rebellion such a these , a well a the effort of abolitionist , the british outlawed slavery in it empire in 1834 , with full abolitionism in the united kingdom from chattel slavery declared in 1838 . the population in 1834 wa 371,070 , of whom 15,000 were white , 5,000 free black ; 40,000 'coloured ' or free people of color ( mixed race ) ; and 311,070 were slave . the resulting labour shortage prompted the british to begin to `` import '' indentured servant to supplement the labour pool , a many freedman resisted working on the plantation . worker recruited from india began arriving in 1845 , chinese worker in 1854 . many south asian and chinese descendant continue to reside in jamaica today .
over the next 20 year , several epidemic of cholera , scarlet fever , and smallpox hit the island , killing almost 60,000 people ( about 10 per day ) . nevertheless , in 1871 the census recorded a population of 506,154 people , 246,573 of which were male , and 259,581 female . their race were recorded a 13,101 white , 100,346 coloured ( mixed black and white ) , and 392,707 black . this period wa marked by an economic slump , with many jamaican living in poverty . dissatisfaction with this , and continued racial discrimination and marginalisation of the black majority , led to the outbreak of the morant bay rebellion in 1865 led by paul bogle , which wa put down by governor edward john eyre with such brutality that he wa recalled from his position . his successor , john peter grant , enacted a series of social , financial and political reform whilst aiming to uphold firm british rule over the island , which became a crown colony in 1866 . in 1872 the capital wa transferred from spanish town to kingston .
<section_title_start> early 20th century <section_title_end>
in 1907 jamaica wa struck by 1907 kingston earthquake  this , and the subsequent fire , caused immense destruction in kingston and the death of 8001,000 people .
unemployment and poverty remained a problem for many jamaican . various movement seeking political change arose a a result , most notably the universal negro improvement association and african community league founded by marcus garvey in 1917 . a well a seeking greater political right and an improvement for the condition of worker , garvey wa also a prominent pan-africanist and proponent of the back-to-africa movement . he wa also one of the chief inspiration behind rastafari , a religion founded in jamaica in the 1930s that combined christianity with an afrocentric theology focused on the figure of haile selassie , emperor of ethiopia . despite occasional persecution , rastafari grew to become an established faith on the island , later spreading abroad .
the great depression of the 1930s hit jamaica hard . a part of the british west indian labour unrest of 193439 , jamaica saw numerous strike , culminating in a strike in 1938 that turned into a full-blown riot .
a a result , the british government instituted report of west india royal commission ( moyne report ) to look into the cause of the disturbance ; their report recommended political and economic reform in britain 's caribbean colony . a new house of representative wa established in 1944 , elected by universal adult suffrage . during this period jamaica 's two-party system emerged , with the creation of the jamaican labour party ( jlp ) under alexander bustamante and the people 's national party ( pnp ) under norman manley .
jamaica slowly gained increasing autonomy from the united kingdom . in 1958 it became a province in the federation of the west indie , a federation of several of british west indie britain 's caribbean colony . membership of the federation proved to be divisive , however , and a 1961 jamaican federation of the west indie membership referendum on the issue saw a slight majority voting to leave . after leaving the federation , jamaica attained full independence of jamaica on 6 august 1962 . the new state retained , however , it membership in the commonwealth of nation ( with the queen a head of state ) and adopted a westminster parliamentary system westminster-style parliamentary system . bustamante , at the age of 78 , became the country 's first prime minister of jamaica .
<section_title_start> post-independence era <section_title_end>
strong economic growth , averaging approximately 6 % per annum , marked the first ten year of independence under conservative jlp government ; these were led by successive prime minister alexander bustamante , donald sangster ( who died of natural cause within two month of taking office ) and hugh shearer . the growth wa fuelled by high level of private investment in bauxite/alumina , tourism , the manufacturing industry and , to a lesser extent , the agricultural sector . in the 1967 jamaican general election , the jlp were victorious again , winning 33 out of 53 seat , with the pnp taking 20 seat .
in term of foreign policy jamaica became a member of the non-aligned movement , seeking to retain strong tie with britain and the united state whilst also developing link with communist state such a cuba .
the optimism of the first decade wa accompanied by a growing sense of inequality among many afro-jamaicans , and a concern that the benefit of growth were not being shared by the urban poor , many of whom ended up living in crime-ridden shanty town in kingston . this , combined with the effect of a slowdown in the global economy in 1970 , led to the voter 1972 jamaican general election under michael manley in 1972 . the pnp won 37 seat to the jlp 's 16.
manley 's government enacted various social reform , such a a higher minimum wage , land reform , legislation for woman 's equality , greater housing construction and an increase in educational provision . internationally he improved tie with the communist bloc and vigorously opposed the apartheid regime in south africa .
in 1976 , the pnp won another landslide , winning 47 seat to the jlp 's 13 . the turnout wa a very high 85 percent . however , the economy faltered in this period due to a combination of internal and external factor ( such a the oil shock ) . the rivalry between the jlp and pnp became intense , and jamaican political conflict political and gang-related violence grew significantly in this period .
by 1980 , jamaica 's gross national product had declined to some 25 % below it 1972 level . seeking change , jamaican voted the jlp 1980 jamaican general election in 1980 under edward seaga , the jlp winning 51 seat to the pnp 's nine seat . firmly anti-communist , seaga cut tie with cuba and sent troop to support the u invasion of grenada in 1983 . the economic deterioration , however , continued into the mid-1980s , exacerbated by a number of factor . the largest and third-largest alumina producer , alpart and alcoa , closed ; and there wa a significant reduction in production by the second-largest producer , alcan . reynolds jamaica mine , ltd. left the jamaican industry . there wa also a decline in tourism , which wa important to the economy . owing to rising foreign and local debt , accompanied by large fiscal deficit , the government sought international monetary fund ( imf ) financing , which wa dependent on implementing various austerity measure . these resulted in strike in 1985 and a decline in support for the seaga government , exacerbated by criticism of the government 's response to the devastation caused by hurricane gilbert in 1988 . having now de-emphasised socialism and adopting a more centrist position , michael manley and the pnp were 1989 jamaican general election re-elected in 1989 , winning 45 seat to the jlp 's 15.
the pnp went on to win a string of election , under prime minister michael manley ( 19891992 ) , p. j. patterson ( 19922005 ) and portia simpson-miller ( 20052007 ) . in the 1993 jamaican general election , patterson led the pnp to victory , winning 52 seat to the jlp 's eight seat . patterson also won the 1997 jamaican general election , by another landslide margin of 50 seat to the jlp 's 10 seat . patterson 's third consecutive victory came in the 2002 jamaican general election , when the pnp retained power , but with a reduced seat majority of 34 seat to 26 . patterson stepped down on 26 february 2006 , and wa replaced by portia simpson-miller , jamaica 's first female prime minister . the turnout slowly declined during this period of time , from 67.4 % in 1993 to 59.1 % in 2002.
during this period various economic reform were introduced , such a deregulating the finance sector and floating the jamaican dollar , a well a greater investment in infrastructure , whilst also retaining a strong social safety net . political violence , so prevalent in the previous two decade , declined significantly .

independence , however widely celebrated in jamaica , ha been questioned in the early 21st century . in 2011 , a survey showed that approximately 60 % of jamaican believe that the country would have been better off had it remained a british colony , with only 17 % believing it would have been worse off , citing a problem year of social and fiscal mismanagement in the country . however , this poll reflected a greater discontent with the jlp handling of crime and the economy , and a a result , holness and the jlp were defeated in the 2011 jamaican general election , which saw portia simpson-miller and the pnp return to power . the number of seat had been increased to 63 , and the pnp swept to power with a landslide 42 seat to the jlp 's 21 . the voter turnout wa 53.17 % .
holness 's jlp won the 2016 jamaican general election general election narrowly , defeating simpson-miller 's pnp , on 25 february . the pnp won 31 seat to the jlp 's 32 . a a result , simpson-miller became opposition leader for a second time . the voter turnout dipped below 50 % for the first time , registering just 48.37 % .
in the 2020 jamaican general election , andrew holness made history for the jlp by accomplishing a second consecutive win for the jamaica labour party , winning 49 seat to 14 won by the pnp , led this time by peter phillips ( politician ) . the last time a consecutive win occurred for the jlp wa in 1980 . however , the turnout at this election wa just 37 % , probably affected by the coronavirus pandemic .

<section_title_start>  aquatic life  <section_title_end>
coral reef ecosystem are important because they provide people with a source of livelihood , food , recreation , and medicinal compound and protect the land on which they live . jamaica relies on the ocean and it ecosystem for it development . however , the marine life in jamaica is also being affected . there could be many factor that contribute to marine life not having the best health . jamaica 's geological origin , topographical feature and seasonal high rainfall make it susceptible to a range of natural hazard that can affect the coastal and oceanic environment . these include storm surge , slope failure ( landslide ) , earthquake , flood and hurricane . coral reef in the negril marine park ( nmp ) , jamaica , have been increasingly impacted by nutrient pollution and macroalgal bloom following decade of intensive development a a major tourist destination . another one of those factor could include tourism : being that jamaica is a very touristy place , the island draw numerous people traveling here from all over the world . the jamaican tourism industry account for 32 % of total employment and 36 % of the country 's gdp and is largely based on the sun , sea and sand , the last two of these attribute being dependent on healthy coral reef ecosystem . because of jamaica 's tourism , they have developed a study to see if the tourist would be willing to help financially to manage their marine ecosystem because jamaica alone is unable to . the ocean connects all the country all over the world , however , everyone and everything is affecting the flow and life in the ocean . jamaica is a very touristy place specifically because of their beach . if their ocean are not functioning at their best then the well-being of jamaica and the people who live there will start to deteriorate . according to the oecd , ocean contribute $ 1.5 trillion annually in value-added to the overall economy . a developing country on an island will get the majority of their revenue from their ocean .
<section_title_start>  pollution  <section_title_end>
pollution come from run-off , sewage system , and garbage . however , this typically all end up in the ocean after there is rain or flood . everything that end up in the water change the quality and balance of the ocean . poor coastal water quality ha adversely affected fishery , tourism and mariculture , a well a undermining biological sustainability of the living resource of ocean and coastal habitat . jamaica import and export many good through their water . some of the import that go into jamaica include petroleum and petroleum product . issue include accident at sea ; risk of spill through local and international transport of petroleum and petroleum product . oil spill can disrupt the marine life with chemical that are not normally found in the ocean . other form of pollution also occur in jamaica . solid waste disposal mechanism in jamaica are currently inadequate . the solid waste get into the water through rainfall force . solid waste is also harmful to wildlife , particularly bird , fish and turtle that feed at the surface of the water and mistake floating debris for food . for example , plastic can be caught around bird and turtle neck making it difficult to eat and breath a they begin to grow causing the plastic to get tighter around their neck . piece of plastic , metal , and glass can be mistaken for the food fish eat . each jamaican generates 1 ; kg ( 2 ; lb ) of waste per day ; only 70 % of this is collected by national solid waste management authority ( nswma )  the remaining 30 % is either burnt or disposed of in gullies/waterways .
<section_title_start>  environmental policy  <section_title_end>
there are policy that are being put into place to help preserve the ocean and the life below water . the goal of integrated coastal zone management ( iczm ) is to improve the quality of life of human community who depend on coastal resource while maintaining the biological diversity and productivity of coastal ecosystem . developing an underdeveloped country can impact the ocean ecosystem because of all the construction that would be done to develop the country . over-building , driven by powerful market force a well a poverty among some sector of the population , and destructive exploitation contribute to the decline of ocean and coastal resource . developing practice that will contribute to the life of the people but also to the life of the ocean and it ecosystem . some of these practice include : develop sustainable fishery practice , ensure sustainable mariculture technique and practice , sustainable management of shipping , and promote sustainable tourism practice . a for tourism , tourism is the number one source of foreign exchange earnings in jamaica and , a such is vital to the national economy . tourist typically go to country unaware of issue and how they impact those issue . tourist are not going to be used to living in a different style compared to their own country . practice such a : provide sewage treatment facility for all tourist area , determine carrying capacity of the environment prior to planning tourism activity , provide alternative type of tourist activity can help to get desired result such a the development of alternative tourism which will reduce the current pressure on resource that support traditional tourism activity . a study wa conducted to see how tourist could help with sustainable financing for ocean and coastal management in jamaica . instead of using tourist fee they would call them environmental fee . this study aim to inform the relevant stakeholder of the feasibility of implementing environmental fee a well a the likely impact of such revenue generating instrument on the current tourist visitation rate to the island . the development of a user fee system would help fund environmental management and protection . the result show that tourist have a high consumer surplus associated with a vacation in jamaica , and have a significantly lower willingness to pay for a tourism tax when compared to an environmental tax . the finding of the study show that the `` label '' of the tax and a well a the respondent 's awareness of the institutional mechanism for environmental protection and tourism are important to their decision framework . tourist are more willing to pay for environmental fee rather than tourist tax fee . a tax high enough to fund for environmental management and protection but low enough to continue to bring tourist to jamaica . it ha been show that if an environmental tax of $ 1 per person were introduced it would not cause a significant decline in visitation rate and would generate revenue of u $ 1.7m .

<section_title_start> colonialism <section_title_end>

<section_title_start> government and politics <section_title_end>
papua new guinea is a commonwealth realm with elizabeth ii a monarchy of papua new guinea . the constitutional convention , which prepared the draft constitution , and australia , the outgoing metropolitan power , had thought that papua new guinea would not remain a monarchy . the founder , however , considered that imperial honour had a cachet . the monarch is represented by the governor-general of papua new guinea , currently bob dadae . papua new guinea ( and the solomon island ) are unusual among commonwealth realm in that governors-general are elected by the legislature , rather than chosen by the executive branch .
the prime minister of papua new guinea head the cabinet of papua new guinea , which consists of 31 member of parliament from the ruling coalition , which make up the government . the current prime minister is james marape . the unicameralism national parliament of papua new guinea ha 111 seat , of which 22 are occupied by the governor of the 22 province and the national capital district ( papua new guinea ) . candidate for member of parliament are voted upon when the prime minister asks the governor-general to call a national election , a maximum of five year after the previous national election .
in the early year of independence , the instability of the party system led to frequent motion of no confidence in parliament , with resulting change of the government , but with referral to the electorate , through national election only occurring every five year . in recent year , successive government have passed legislation preventing such vote sooner than 18 month after a national election and within 12 month of the next election . in 2012 , the first two ( of three ) reading were passed to prevent vote of no confidence occurring within the first 30 month . this restriction on vote of no confidence ha arguably resulted in greater stability , although perhaps at a cost of reducing the accountability of the executive branch of government .
election in png attract numerous candidate . after independence in 1975 , member were elected by the first-past-the-post voting first-past-the-post system , with winner frequently gaining le than 15 % of the vote . electoral reform in 2001 introduced the limited preferential vote system ( lpv ) , a version of the instant-runoff voting . the 2007 papua new guinean general election wa the first to be conducted using lpv .
under a 2002 amendment , the leader of the party winning the largest number of seat in the election is invited by the governor-general to form the government , if she can muster the necessary majority in parliament . the process of forming such a coalition in png , where party do not have much ideology , involves considerable `` horse-trading '' right up until the last moment . peter o'neill emerged a papua new guinea 's prime minister after the july 2012 election , and formed a government with leo dion , the former governor of east new britain province , a deputy prime minister .
in 2011 there wa a 20112012 papua new guinean constitutional crisis between the parliament-elect prime minister , peter o'neill ( voted into office by a large majority of mp ) , and michael somare , who wa deemed by the supreme court to retain office . the stand-off between parliament and the supreme court continued until the july 2012 national election , with legislation passed effectively removing the chief justice and subjecting the supreme court member to greater control by the legislature , a well a a series of other law passed , for example limiting the age for a prime minister . the confrontation reached a peak , with the deputy prime minister entering the supreme court during a hearing , escorted by police , ostensibly to arrest the chief justice . there wa strong pressure among some mp to defer the national election for a further six month to one year , although their power to do that were highly questionable . the parliament-elect prime minister and other cooler-headed mp carried the vote for the writ for the new election to be issued , slightly late , but for the election itself to occur on time , thereby avoiding a continuation of the constitutional crisis .
in may 2019 , o'neill resigned a prime minister and wa replaced through a vote of parliament by james marape . davis steven wa appointed deputy prime minister .
<section_title_start>  law  <section_title_end>
the unicameral parliament enacts legislation in the same manner a in other commonwealth realm that use the westminster system of government . the cabinet collectively agree government policy , then the relevant minister introduces bill to parliament , depending on which government department is responsible for implementation of a particular law . back bench member of parliament can also introduce bill . parliament debate bill , and ( section 110.1 of the constitution ) they become enacted law when the speaker certifies that parliament ha passed them . there is no royal assent .
all ordinary statute enacted by parliament must be consistent with the constitution . the court have jurisdiction to rule on the constitutionality of statute , both in dispute before them and on a reference where there is no dispute but only an abstract question of law . unusually among developing country , the judicial branch of government in papua new guinea ha remained remarkably independent , and successive executive government have continued to respect it authority .
the `` underlying law '' ( papua new guinea 's common law ) consists of principle and rule of common law and equity in english common law a it stood on 16 september 1975 ( the date of independence ) , and thereafter the decision of png 's own court . the court are directed by the constitution and , latterly , the underlying law act , to take note of the `` custom '' of traditional community . they are to determine which custom are common to the whole country and may be declared also to be part of the underlying law . in practice , this ha proved difficult and ha been largely neglected . statute are largely adapted from overseas jurisdiction , primarily australia and england . advocacy in the court follows the adversarial pattern of other common-law country . this national court system , used in town and city , is supported by a village court system in the more remote area . the law underpinning the village court is 'customary law ' .

the country is situated on the pacific ring of fire , at the point of collision of several plate tectonics . geologically , the island of new guinea is a northern extension of the indo-australian plate indo-australian tectonic plate , forming part of a single land mass which is australia ( continent ) australia-new guinea ( also called sahul or meganesia ) . it is connected to the australian segment by a shallow continental shelf across the torres strait , which in former age lay exposed a a land bridge , particularly during ice age when sea level were lower than at present . a the indo-australian plate ( which includes landmass of india , australia , and the indian ocean floor in between ) drift north , it collides with the eurasian plate . the collision of the two plate pushed up the himalaya , the indonesian island , and new guinea 's central range . the central range is much younger and higher than the mountain of australia , so high that it is home to rare equatorial glacier .
there are several active volcano , and eruption are frequent . earthquake are relatively common , sometimes accompanied by tsunami . on 25 february 2018 , an 2018 papua new guinea earthquake earthquake of magnitude 7.5 and depth of 35 kilometre struck the middle of papua new guinea . the worst of the damage wa centred around the southern highland region . papua new guinea is one of the few region close to the equator that experience snowfall , which occurs in the most elevated part of the mainland .
the border between papua new guinea and indonesia wa confirmed by treaty with australia before independence in 1974 . the land border comprises a segment of the 141st meridian east 141 e meridian from the north coast southward to where it meet the fly river flowing east , then a short curve of the river 's thalweg to where it meet the 14101'10 '' e meridian flowing west , then southward to the south coast . the 141 e meridian formed the entire eastern boundary of dutch new guinea according to it 1828 annexation proclamation . treaty of the hague ( 1895 ) the dutch and british agreed to a territorial exchange , bringing the entire left bank of the fly river into british new guinea and moving the southern border east to the torasi estuary . the maritime boundary with australia wa confirmed by a treaty in 1978 . in the torres strait it run close to the mainland of new guinea , keeping the adjacent north western torres strait island ( dauan island , boigu island ( queensland ) and saibai island ) under australian sovereignty . maritime boundary with the solomon island were confirmed by papua new guineasolomon island maritime boundary treaty .

many of the other island within png territory , including new britain , new ireland , bougainville , the admiralty island , the trobriand island , and the louisiade archipelago , were never linked to new guinea by land bridge . a a consequence , they have their own flora and fauna ; in particular , they lack many of the land mammal and flightless bird that are common to new guinea and australia .
australia and new guinea are portion of the ancient supercontinent of gondwana , which started to break into smaller continent in the cretaceous period , 65130 million year ago . australia finally broke free from antarctica about 45 million year ago . all the australasian land are home to the antarctic flora , descended from the flora of southern gondwana , including the pinophyta podocarpaceae and araucaria pine , and the broad-leafed southern beech ( nothofagus ) . these plant family are still present in papua new guinea . new guinea is part of the humid tropic , and many indomalayan realm rainforest plant spread across the narrow strait from asia , mixing together with the old australian and antarctic flora .

<section_title_start>  climate  <section_title_end>
the climate on the island is essentially tropical , but it varies by region . the maximum mean temperature in the lowland is 30 to 32  c , and the minimum 23-24  c. in the highland above 2100 meter , colder condition prevail and night frost are common there , while the daytime temperature exceeds 22 c , regardless of the season .
<section_title_start>  economy  <section_title_end>
papua new guinea is richly endowed with natural resource , including mineral and renewable resource , such a forest , marine ( including a large portion of the world 's major tuna stock ) , and in some part agriculture . the rugged terrainincluding high mountain range and valley , swamp and islandsand high cost of developing infrastructure , combined with other factor ( including law and order problem in some centre and the system of customary land title ) make it difficult for outside developer . local developer are handicapped by year of deficient investment in education , health , and access to finance . agriculture , for subsistence and cash crop , provides a livelihood for 85 % of the population and continues to provide some 30 % of gdp . mineral deposit , including gold , oil , and copper , account for 72 % of export earnings . elaeis guineensis production ha grown steadily over recent year ( largely from estate and with extensive outgrower output ) , with palm oil now the main agricultural export . coffee remains the major export crop ( produced largely in the highland province ) ; followed by cocoa bean and coconut oil/copra from the coastal area , each largely produced by smallholder ; tea , produced on estate ; and rubber . the iagifu/hedinia field wa discovered in 1986 in the papuan fold and thrust belt .
former prime minister sir mekere morauta tried to restore integrity to state institution , stabilise the papua new guinean kina , restore stability to the national budget , privatise public enterprise where appropriate , and ensure ongoing peace on bougainville following the 1997 agreement which ended bougainville 's secessionist unrest . the morauta government had considerable success in attracting international support , specifically gaining the backing of the international monetary fund ( imf ) and the world bank in securing development assistance loan .
a of 2019 , png 's real gdp growth rate wa 3.8 % , with an inflation rate of 4.3 % this economic growth ha been primarily attributed to strong commodity price , particularly mineral but also agricultural , with the high demand for mineral product largely sustained even during the crisis by the buoyant asian market , mining in papua new guinea and by a buoyant outlook and the construction phase for natural gas exploration , production , and exportation in liquefied form ( liquefied natural gas or `` lng '' ) by lng carrier , all of which will require multibillion-dollar investment ( exploration , production well , pipeline , storage , liquefaction plant , port terminal , lng tanker ship ) .
the first major gas project wa the png lng joint venture . exxonmobil is operator of the joint venture , also comprising png company oil search , santos limited , kumul petroleum holding ( papua new guinea 's national oil and gas company ) , jxtg holding , the png government 's mineral resource development company and petromin corporation . the project is an integrated development that includes gas production and processing facility in the hela province , southern highland province and western province ( papua new guinea ) province of papua new guinea , including liquefaction and storage facility ( located northwest of port moresby ) with capacity of 6.9 million tonne per year . there are over of pipeline connecting the facility . it is the largest private-sector investment in the history of png . a second major project is based on initial right held by the french oil and gas major total s.a. and the u.s. company interoil corp. ( ioc ) , which have partly combined their asset after total agreed in december 2013 to purchase 61.3 % of ioc 's antelope and elk gas field right , with the plan to develop them starting in 2016 , including the construction of a liquefaction plant to allow export of lng . total s.a. ha separately another joint operating agreement with oil search .
further gas and mineral project are proposed ( including the large wafi-golpu copper-gold mine ) , with extensive exploration ongoing across the country .
the png government 's long-term vision 2050 and shorter-term policy document , including the 2013 budget and the 2014 responsible sustainable development strategy , emphasise the need for a more diverse economy , based upon sustainable industry and avoiding the effect of dutch disease from major resource extraction project undermining other industry , a ha occurred in many country experiencing oil or other mineral boom , notably in western africa , undermining much of their agriculture sector , manufacturing and tourism , and with them broad-based employment prospect . measure have been taken to mitigate these effect , including through the establishment of a sovereign wealth fund , partly to stabilise revenue and expenditure flow , but much will depend upon the readiness to make real reform to effective use of revenue , tackling rampant corruption and empowering household and business to access market , service and develop a more buoyant economy , with lower cost , especially for small to medium-size enterprise . one major project conducted through the png department for community development suggested that other pathway to sustainable development should be considered .
the institute of national affair , a png independent policy think tank , provides a report on the business and investment environment of papua new guinea every five year , based upon a survey of large and small , local and overseas company , highlighting law and order problem and corruption , a the worst impediment , followed by the poor state of transport , power and communication infrastructure .
<section_title_start>  land tenure  <section_title_end>
the png legislature ha enacted law in which a type of tenure called `` aboriginal title customary land title ] '' is recognised , meaning that the traditional land of the [ [ indigenous people have some legal basis to inalienable tenure . this customary land notionally cover most of the usable land in the country ( some 97 % of total land area ) ; alienated land is either held privately under state lease or is government land . freehold title ( also known a fee simple ) can only be held by papua new guinean citizen .
only some 3 % of the land of papua new guinea is in private hand ; this is privately held under 99-year state lease , or it is held by the state . there is virtually no freehold title ; the few existing freehold are automatically converted to state lease when they are transferred between vendor and purchaser . unalienated land is owned under customary title by traditional landowner . the precise nature of the seisin varies from one culture to another . many writer portray land a in the communal ownership of traditional clan ; however , closer study usually show that the smallest portion of land whose ownership can not be further divided are held by the individual head of extended family and their descendant or their descendant alone if they have recently died .
this is a matter of vital importance because a problem of economic development is identifying the membership of customary landowning group and the owner . dispute between mining and forestry company and landowner group often devolve on the issue of whether the company entered into contractual relation for the use of land with the true owner . customary propertyusually land can not be devised by will . it can only be inherited according to the custom of the deceased 's people . the land act wa amended in 2010 along with the land group incorporation act , intended to improve the management of state land , mechanism for dispute resolution over land , and to enable customary landowner to be better able to access finance and possible partnership over portion of their land , if they seek to develop it for urban or rural economic activity . the land group incorporation act requires more specific identification of the customary landowner than hitherto and their more specific authorisation before any land arrangement are determined ; ( a major issue in recent year ha been a land grab , using , or rather misusing , the lease-leaseback provision under the land act , notably using 'special agricultural and business lease ' ( sabls ) to acquire vast tract of customary land , purportedly for agricultural project , but in an almost all case a a back-door mechanism for securing tropical forest resource for loggingcircumventing the more exacting requirement of the forest act , for securing timber permit ( which must comply with sustainability requirement and be competitively secured , and with the customary landowner approval ) . following a national outcry , these sabls have been subject to a commission of inquiry , established in mid-2011 , for which the report is still awaited for initial presentation to the prime minister and parliament .

in antiquity , somalia wa an important commercial center . it is among the most probable location of the fabled ancient land of punt . during the middle age , several powerful somali empire dominated the regional trade , including the ajuran sultanate , the adal sultanate , and the sultanate of the geledi .
in the late 19th century , somalia wa colonized by italian empire . the italian established the colony of italian somaliland . in the interior , mohammed abdullah hassan 's dervish movement ( somali ) somaliland campaign the british in the neighbouring british somaliland four time , forcing them to retreat to the coast , before finally being defeated in the somaliland campaign ( 1920 ) . italy acquired full control of the northeastern , central , and southern part of the area after successfully waging the history of somalia # 20th century against the ruling majeerteen sultanate and sultanate of hobyo . in 1960 , the two territory united to form the independent somali republic under a civilian government .
the supreme revolutionary council ( somalia ) seized power in 1969 and established the somali democratic republic , which collapsed 22 year later , in 1991 , with the onset of the somali civil war . during this period most region returned to xeer and sharia . in the early 2000s , a number of interim federal administration were created . the transitional national government , republic of somalia ( tng ) wa established in 2000 , followed by the formation of the transitional federal government , republic of somalia ( tfg ) in 2004 , which reestablished the somali armed force . in 2006 , the tfg assumed control of most of the nation 's southern conflict zone from the newly formed islamic court union ( icu ) . the icu subsequently splintered into more radical group , such a al-shabaab ( militant group ) al-shabaab , which battled the tfg and it african union mission to somalia ( 2007present ) ally for control of the region .

<section_title_start> history <section_title_end>
<section_title_start> prehistory <section_title_end>
somalia ha been inhabited since at least the paleolithic period . during the stone age , the doian and hargeisan culture flourished here . the oldest evidence of burial custom in the horn of africa come from cemetery in somalia dating back to the 4th millennium bce . the stone implement from the jalelo site in the north were also characterized in 1909 a important artifact demonstrating the archaeological universality during the paleolithic between the east and the west .
according to linguist , the first afroasiatic languages-speaking population arrived in the region during the ensuing neolithic period from the family 's proposed afroasiatic urheimat ( `` original homeland '' ) in the nile valley , or the near east .
the laas geel complex on the outskirt of hargeisa in northwestern somalia date back approximately 5,000 year , and ha rock art depicting both wild animal and decorated cow . other cave painting are found in the northern dhambalin region , which feature one of the earliest known depiction of a hunter on horseback . the rock art is dated to 1,000 to 3,000 bce . additionally , between the town of la khorey and el ayo in northern somalia lie karinhegane , the site of numerous cave painting of both real and mythical animal . each painting ha an inscription below it , which collectively have been estimated to be around 2,500 year old .
<section_title_start> antiquity and classical era <section_title_end>
ancient pyramidical structure , mausoleum , ruined city and stone wall , such a the wargaade wall , are evidence of an old civilization that once thrived in the somali peninsula . this civilization enjoyed a trading relationship with ancient egypt and mycenaean greece since the second millennium bce , supporting the hypothesis that somalia or adjacent region were the location of the ancient land of punt . the puntites native to the region , traded myrrh , spice , gold , ebony , short-horned cattle , ivory and frankincense with the egyptian , phoenician , babylonian , indian , chinese and roman through their commercial port . an egyptian expedition sent to punt by the eighteenth dynasty of egypt queen hatshepsut is recorded on the temple relief at deir el-bahari , during the reign of the puntite king parahu and queen ati . in 2015 , isotopic analysis of ancient baboon mummy from punt that had been brought to egypt a gift indicated that the specimen likely originated from an area encompassing eastern somalia and the eritrea-ethiopia corridor .
in the classical antiquity , the macrobians , who may have been ancestral to somali , established a powerful tribal kingdom that ruled large part of modern somalia . they were reputed for their longevity and wealth , and were said to be the `` tallest and handsomest of all men '' . the macrobians were warrior herder and seafarer . according to herodotus ' account , the persian emperor cambyses ii , upon his history of achaemenid egypt in 525 bc , sent ambassador to macrobia , bringing luxury gift for the macrobian king to entice his submission . the macrobian ruler , who wa elected based on his stature and beauty , replied instead with a challenge for his persian counterpart in the form of an unstrung bow : if the persian could manage to draw it , they would have the right to invade his country ; but until then , they should thank the god that the macrobians never decided to invade their empire . the macrobians were a regional power reputed for their advanced architecture and gold wealth , which wa so plentiful that they shackled their prisoner in golden chain . the camel is believed to have been domesticated in the horn region sometime between the 2nd and 3rd millennium bce . from there , it spread to egypt and the maghreb .
during the classical period , the sesea city-state also known a sesea of mosylon , opone , heis ( town ) , bulhar , malao , zeila , essina , nikon ( somalia ) and sarapion developed a lucrative trade network , connecting with merchant from ptolemaic kingdom , ancient greece , phoenicia , parthian empire , sabaeans , the nabataean kingdom , and the roman empire . they used the ancient somali maritime vessel known a the beden to transport their cargo .
after the nabatea # roman annexation and the roman naval presence at aden to curb piracy , arab and somali merchant agreed with the roman to bar indian ship from trading in the free port city of the arabian peninsula to protect the interest of somali and arab merchant in the lucrative commerce between the red and mediterranean sea . however , indian merchant continued to trade in the port city of the somali peninsula , which wa free from roman interference . for century , indian merchant brought large quantity of cinnamon to somalia and arabia from ceylon and the maluku island . the source of the cinnamon and other spice is said to have been the best-kept secret of arab and somali merchant in their trade with the roman and greek world ; the roman and greek believed the source to have been the somali peninsula . the collusive agreement among somali and arab trader inflated the price of indian and chinese cinnamon in north africa , the near east , and europe , and made the cinnamon trade a very profitable revenue generator , especially for the somali merchant through whose hand large quantity were shipped across sea and land route .
<section_title_start> birth of islam and the middle ages <section_title_end>
islam wa introduced to the area early on by the first muslim of mecca fleeing prosecution during the first hegira with masjid al-qiblatayn ( somalia ) masjid al-qiblatayn in zeila being built before the qiblah towards mecca . it is one of the oldest mosque in africa . in the late 9th century , al-yaqubi wrote that muslim were living along the northern somali seaboard . he also mentioned that the adal sultanate had it capital in the city . according to leo africanus , the adal sultanate wa governed by local somali people dynasty and it realm encompassed the geographical area between the bab el mandeb and cape guardafui . it wa thus flanked to the south by the ajuran empire and to the west by the abyssinian empire .
in 1332 , the zeila-based king of adal wa slain in a military campaign aimed at halting abyssinian emperor amda seyon i 's march toward the city . when the last sultan of ifat , sa'ad ad-din ii , wa also killed by emperor dawit i of ethiopia in zeila in 1410 , his child escaped to yemen , before returning in 1415 . in the early 15th century , adal 's capital wa moved further inland to the town of dakkar , where sabr ad-din ii , the eldest son of sa'ad ad-din ii , established a new base after his return from yemen .
adal 's headquarters were again relocated the following century , this time southward to harar . from this new capital , adal organised an effective army led by imam ahmad ibn ibrahim al-ghazi ( ahmad `` gurey '' or `` gran '' ; both meaning `` the left-handed '' ) that invaded the abyssinian empire . this 16th-century campaign is historically known a the abyssinianadal war ( futuh al-habash ) . during the war , imam ahmad pioneered the use of cannon supplied by the ottoman empire , which he imported through zeila and deployed against abyssinian force and their portuguese ally led by cristvo da gama . some scholar argue that this conflict proved , through their use on both side , the value of firearm such a the matchlock musket , cannon , and the arquebus over traditional weapon .
during the ajuran sultanate period , the sultanate and republic of merca , mogadishu , barawa , hobyo and their respective port flourished and had a lucrative foreign commerce , with ship sailing to and coming from arabia , india , venetia ( region ) , persia , egypt , portugal , and a far away a china . vasco da gama , who passed by mogadishu in the 15th century , noted that it wa a large city with house several storey high and large palace in it centre , in addition to many mosque with cylindrical minaret . the harla people , an early hamitic group of tall stature who inhabited part of somalia , tchertcher and other area in the horn , also erected various tumulus . these mason are believed to have been ancestral to ethnic somali .
in the 16th century , duarte barbosa noted that many ship from the khambhat in modern-day india sailed to mogadishu with cloth and spice , for which they in return received gold , wax and ivory . barbosa also highlighted the abundance of meat , wheat , barley , horse , and fruit on the coastal market , which generated enormous wealth for the merchant . mogadishu , the center of a thriving textile industry known a toob benadir ( specialized for the market in egypt , among other place ) , together with merca and barawa , also served a a transit stop for swahili people merchant from mombasa and malindi and for the gold trade from kilwa sultanate . jewish merchant from the strait of hormuz brought their indian textile and fruit to the somali coast in exchange for grain and wood .
trading relation were established with malacca in the 15th century , with cloth , ambergris and porcelain being the main commodity of the trade . giraffe , zebra and incense were exported to the ming empire of china , which established somali merchant a leader in the commerce between east asia and the horn . hindu merchant from surat and southeast african merchant from pate island , seeking to bypass both the portuguese india blockade ( and later the omani interference ) , used the somali port of merca and barawa ( which were out of the two power ' direct jurisdiction ) to conduct their trade in safety and without interference .
<section_title_start> early modern era and the scramble for africa <section_title_end>
in the early modern period , successor state to the adal sultanate and ajuran sultanate began to flourish in somalia . these included the warsangali sultanate , the bari , somalia , the sultanate of the geledi ( gobroon dynasty ) , the majeerteen sultanate ( migiurtinia ) , and the sultanate of hobyo ( obbia ) . they continued the tradition of castle-building and seaborne trade established by previous somali empire .
sultan yusuf mahamud ibrahim , the third sultan of the house of gobroon , started the golden age of the gobroon dynasty . his army came out victorious during the bardheere jihad , which restored stability in the region and revitalized the east african ivory trade . he also received present from and had cordial relation with the ruler of neighbouring and distant kingdom such a the omani , wituland and yemeni sultan .
sultan ibrahim 's son ahmed yusuf ( gobroon ) succeeded him and wa one of the most important figure in 19th-century east africa , receiving tribute from omani governor and creating alliance with important muslim family on the east african coast . in northern somalia , the gerad dynasty conducted trade with yemen and persia and competed with the merchant of the bari dynasty . the gerads and the bari sultan built impressive palace and fortress and had close relation with many different empire in the near east .
in the late 19th century , after the berlin conference of 1884 , european power began the scramble for africa , which inspired the dervish leader mohammed abdullah hassan to rally support from across the horn of africa and begin one of the longest colonial resistance war in history . in several of his poem and speech , hassan emphasized that the british `` have destroyed our religion and made our child their child '' and that the christian ethiopian in league with the british were bent upon plundering the political and religious freedom of the somali nation . he soon emerged a `` a champion of his country 's political and religious freedom , defending it against all christian invader '' .
hassan issued a religious ordinance stipulating that any somali national who did not accept the goal of unity of somali , greater somalia and would not fight under his leadership would be considered to be kafir , or gaal . he soon acquired weapon from the ottoman empire , sudan , other islamic and arabian country , and appointed minister and adviser to administer different area or sector of somalia . in addition , he gave a clarion call for somali unity and independence , in the process of organizing his force .
hassan 's dervish movement had an essentially military character , and the dervish revolt wa fashioned on the model of a salihiya brotherhood . it wa characterized by a rigid hierarchy and centralization . though hassan threatened to drive the christian into the sea , he executed the first attack by launching his first major military offensive with 1,500 dervish equipped with 20 modern rifle on the british soldier stationed in the region . he repulsed the british in four expedition and had relation with the central power of the ottoman and the german . in 1920 , the dervish movement collapsed after intensive aerial bombardment by britain , and dervish territory were subsequently turned incorporated into the british protectorate .
the dawn of fascism in the early 1920s heralded a change of strategy for italy , a the north-eastern sultanate were soon to be forced within the boundary of la grande somalia according to the plan of fascist italy . with the arrival of governor cesare maria de vecchi on 15 december 1923 , thing began to change for that part of somaliland known a italian somaliland . italy had access to these area under the successive protection treaty , but not direct rule .
the fascist government had direct rule only over the benadir territory . kingdom of italy # fascist regime ( 19221943 ) , under benito mussolini , attacked abyssinia ( ethiopia ) in 1935 , with an aim to colonize it . the invasion wa condemned by the league of nation , but little wa done to stop it or to liberate occupied ethiopia . on 3 august 1940 , italian troop , including somali colonial unit , crossed from ethiopia to italian conquest of british somaliland , and by 14 august , succeeded in taking berbera from the british .
a british force , including troop from several african country , launched the east african campaign ( world war ii ) from kenya to liberate british somaliland and italian-occupied ethiopia and conquer italian somaliland . by february most of italian somaliland wa captured and , in march , british somaliland wa retaken from the sea . the force of the british empire operating in somaliland comprised the three division of south african , west african , and east african troop . they were assisted by somali force led by abdulahi hassan with somali of the isaaq , dhulbahante , and warsangali clan prominently participating . the number of italian somali began to decline after world war ii , with fewer than 10,000 remaining in 1960.
<section_title_start> independence ( 19601969 )  <section_title_end>
following world war ii , britain retained control of both british somaliland and italian somaliland a protectorate . in 1945 , during the potsdam conference , the united nation granted italy trusteeship of italian somaliland a the trust territory of somaliland , on the condition first proposed by the somali youth league ( syl ) and other nascent somali political organization , such a hizbia digil mirifle somali ( hdms ) and the somali national league ( snl ) that somalia achieve independence within ten year . british somaliland remained a protectorate of britain until 1960.
to the extent that italy held the territory by un mandate , the trusteeship provision gave the somali the opportunity to gain experience in western political education and self-government . these were advantage that british somaliland , which wa to be incorporated into the new somali state , did not have . although in the 1950s british colonial official attempted , through various administrative development effort , to make up for past neglect , the protectorate stagnated in political administrative development . the disparity between the two territory in economic development and political experience would later cause serious difficulty integrating the two part .
meanwhile , in 1948 , under pressure from their world war ii ally and to the dismay of the somali , the british returned the haud ( an important somali grazing area that wa presumably protected by british treaty with the somali in 1884 and 1886 ) and the somali region to ethiopia , based on a treaty they signed in 1897 in which the british ceded somali territory to the ethiopian emperor menelek ii of ethiopia in exchange for his help against possible advance by the french .
britain included the conditional provision that the somali resident would retain their autonomy , but ethiopia immediately claimed sovereignty over the area . this prompted an unsuccessful bid by britain in 1956 to buy back the somali land it had turned over . britain also granted administration of the almost exclusively somali-inhabited northern frontier district ( nfd ) to kenyan nationalist . this wa despite a plebiscite in which , according to a british colonial commission , almost all of the territory 's ethnic somali favored joining the newly formed somali republic .
a french somaliland overseas territory referendum , 1958 wa held in neighbouring djibouti ( then known a french somaliland ) in 1958 , on the eve of somalia 's independence in 1960 , to decide whether or not to join the somali republic or to remain with france . the referendum turned out in favour of a continued association with france , largely due to a combined yes vote by the sizable afar people ethnic group and resident european . there wa also widespread vote rigging , with the french expelling thousand of somali before the referendum reached the poll .
the majority of those who voted 'no ' were somali who were strongly in favour of joining a united somalia , a had been proposed by mahmoud harbi , vice president of the government council . harbi wa killed in a plane crash two year later . djibouti finally gained independence from france in 1977 , and hassan gouled aptidon , a somali who had campaigned for a 'yes ' vote in the referendum of 1976 , eventually became djibouti 's first president ( 19771999 ) .
on 1 july 1960 , the two territory united to form the somali republic , albeit within boundary drawn up by italy and britain . a government wa formed by abdullahi issa and muhammad haji ibrahim egal with other member of the trusteeship and protectorate government , with abdulcadir muhammed aden a president of the parliament of somalia , aden abdullah osman daar a list of president of somalia of the somali republic , and abdirashid ali shermarke a prime minister of somalia ( later to become president from 1967 to 1969 ) . on 20 july 1961 and through a somali constitutional referendum , 1961 , wa ratified popularly by the people of somalia under italian trusteeship , but most of the people from the former somaliland protectorate did n't participated the referendum , due to the marginalization graveness made on their right of power sharing of the unity government . only small number of somalilanders participated the referendum voted against the constitution of somalia , which wa first drafted in 1960 . in 1967 , muhammad haji ibrahim egal became prime minister , a position to which he wa appointed by shermarke . egal would later become the president of the autonomous somaliland region in northwestern somalia .
on 15 october 1969 , while paying a visit to the northern town of la anod , somalia 's then president abdirashid ali shermarke wa shot dead by one of his own bodyguard . his assassination wa quickly followed by a military coup d'tat on 21 october 1969 ( the day after his funeral ) , in which the military of somalia seized power without encountering armed opposition  essentially a bloodless takeover . the putsch wa spearheaded by major general siad barre , who at the time commanded the army .
<section_title_start> somali democratic republic ( 19691987 )  <section_title_end>
alongside barre , the supreme revolutionary council ( somalia ) ( src ) that assumed power after president sharmarke 's assassination wa led by lieutenant colonel salaad gabeyre kediye and chief of police jama korshel . kediye officially held the title `` father of the revolution '' , and barre shortly afterwards became the head of the src . the src subsequently renamed the country the somali democratic republic , dissolved the parliament and the supreme court , and suspended the constitution .
the revolutionary army established large-scale public work program and successfully implemented an urban and rural literacy campaign , which helped dramatically increase the literacy rate . in addition to a nationalization program of industry and land , the new regime 's foreign policy placed an emphasis on somalia 's traditional and religious link with the arab world , eventually joining the arab league in february , 1974 . that same year , barre also served a chairman of the organisation of african unity ( oau ) , the predecessor of the african union ( au ) .
in july 1976 , barre 's src disbanded itself and established in it place the somali revolutionary socialist party ( srsp ) , a one-party government based on scientific socialism and islamic tenet . the srsp wa an attempt to reconcile the official state ideology with the official state religion by revisionism ( marxism ) to local circumstance . emphasis wa placed on the muslim principle of social progress , equality and justice , which the government argued formed the core of scientific socialism and it own accent on self-sufficiency , public participation and popular control , a well a direct ownership of the mean of production . while the srsp encouraged private investment on a limited scale , the administration 's overall direction wa essentially communism .
in july 1977 , the ogaden war broke out after barre 's government used a plea for national unity to justify an war of aggression incorporation of the predominantly somali-inhabited ogaden region of ethiopia into a pan-somali greater somalia , along with the rich agricultural land of south-eastern ethiopia , infrastructure , and strategically important area a far north a djibouti . in the first week of the conflict , somali armed force took southern and central ogaden and for most of the war , the somali army scored continuous victory on the ethiopian army and followed them a far a sidamo province . by september 1977 , somalia controlled 90 % of the ogaden and captured strategic city such a jijiga and put heavy pressure on dire dawa , threatening the train route from the latter city to djibouti . after the siege of harar , a massive unprecedented soviet intervention consisting of 20,000 cuban force and several thousand soviet expert came to the aid of ethiopia 's communist derg regime . by 1978 , the somali troop were ultimately pushed out of the ogaden . this shift in support by the soviet union motivated the barre government to seek ally elsewhere . it eventually settled on the soviet ' cold war arch-rival , the united state , which had been courting the somali government for some time . all in all , somalia 's initial friendship with the soviet union and later partnership with the united state enabled it to build the largest army in africa .
a new constitution wa promulgated in 1979 under which election for a people 's assembly were held . however , barre 's somali revolutionary socialist party politburo continued to rule . in october 1980 , the srsp wa disbanded , and the supreme revolutionary council wa re-established in it place . by that time , barre 's government had become increasingly unpopular . many somali had become disillusioned with life under military dictatorship .
the regime wa weakened further in the 1980s a the cold war drew to a close and somalia 's strategic importance wa diminished . the government became increasingly authoritarianism , and resistance movement , encouraged by ethiopia , sprang up across the country , eventually leading to the somali civil war . among the militia group were the somali salvation democratic front ( ssdf ) , united somali congress ( usc ) , somali national movement ( snm ) and the somali patriotic movement ( spm ) , together with the non-violent political opposition of the somali democratic movement ( sdm ) , the faction in the somali civil war # somali democratic alliance ( sda ) ( sda ) and the somali manifesto group ( smg ) .
<section_title_start> somalia civil war <section_title_end>
the moral authority of barre 's government wa gradually eroded , a many somali became disillusioned with life under military rule . by the mid-1980s , resistance movement supported by ethiopia 's communist derg administration had sprung up across the country . barre responded by ordering punitive measure against those he perceived a locally supporting the guerrilla , especially in the northern region . the clampdown included bombing of city , with the northwestern administrative centre of hargeisa , a somali national movement ( snm ) stronghold , among the targeted area in 1988 . the bombardment wa led by general mohammed said hersi morgan , barre 's son-in-law .
during 1990 , in the capital city of mogadishu , the resident were prohibited from gathering publicly in group greater than three or four . fuel shortage caused long line of car at petrol station . inflation had driven the price of pasta ( ordinary dry italian noodle , a staple at that time ) to five u.s. dollar per kilogram . the price of khat , imported daily from kenya , wa also five u.s. dollar per standard bunch . paper currency note were of such low value that several bundle were needed to pay for simple restaurant meal .
a thriving black market existed in the centre of the city a bank experienced shortage of local currency for exchange . at night , the city of mogadishu lay in darkness . close monitoring of all visiting foreigner wa in effect . harsh exchange control regulation were introduced to prevent export of foreign currency . although no travel restriction were placed on foreigner , photographing many location wa banned . during daytime in mogadishu , the appearance of any government military force wa extremely rare . alleged late-night operation by government authority , however , included `` disappearance '' of individual from their home .
in 1991 , the barre administration wa ousted by a coalition of clan-based opposition group , backed by ethiopia 's then-ruling derg regime and great socialist people 's libyan arab jamahiriya . following a meeting of the somali national movement and northern clan ' elder , the northern former british portion of the country declared it independence a the somaliland in may 1991 . although de facto independent and relatively stable compared to the tumultuous south , it ha not been recognized by any foreign government .
many of the opposition group subsequently began competing for influence in the power vacuum that followed the ouster of barre 's regime . in the south , armed faction led by usc commander general mohamed farah aidid and ali mahdi mohamed , in particular , clashed a each sought to exert authority over the capital . in 1991 , a multi-phased international conference on somalia wa held in neighbouring djibouti . aidid boycotted the first meeting in protest .
due to the legitimacy bestowed on muhammad by the djibouti conference , he wa subsequently recognized by the international community a the new president of somalia . djibouti , egypt , saudi arabia and italy were among the country that officially extended recognition to muhammad 's administration . he wa not able to exert his authority beyond part of the capital . power wa instead vied with other faction leader in the southern half of somalia and with autonomous sub-national entity in the north . the djibouti conference wa followed by two abortive agreement for national reconciliation and disarmament , which were signed by 15 political stakeholder : an agreement to hold an informal preparatory meeting on national reconciliation , and the 1993 addis ababa agreement made at the conference on national reconciliation .
<section_title_start>  failed state status and international intervention  <section_title_end>
in the early 1990s , due to the protracted lack of a permanent central authority , somalia began to be characterized a a `` failed state '' . political scientist kenneth menkhaus argues that evidence suggested that the nation had already attained failed state status by the mid-1980s , while robert i. rotberg similarly posit that the state failure had preceded the ouster of the barre administration . hoehne ( 2009 ) , branwen ( 2009 ) and verhoeven ( 2009 ) also used somalia during this period a a case study to critique various aspect of the `` state failure '' discourse .
united nation security council resolution 733 and united nation security council resolution 746 led to the creation of united nation operation in somalia i , the first mission to provide humanitarian relief and help restore order in somalia after the dissolution of it central government . united nation security council resolution 794 wa unanimously passed on 3 december 1992 , which approved a coalition of united nation peacekeeping led by the united state . forming the unified task force ( unitaf ) , the alliance wa tasked with assuring security until humanitarian effort aimed at stabilizing the situation were transferred to the un . landing in 1993 , the un peacekeeping coalition started the two-year united nation operation in somalia ii ( unosom ii ) primarily in the south . unitaf 's original mandate wa to use `` all necessary mean '' to guarantee the delivery of humanitarian aid in accordance to chapter vii of the united nation charter , and is regarded a a success .
aidid saw unosom ii a a threat to his power and in june 1993 his militia attacked pakistan army troop , attached to unosom ii , ( see un peacekeeping mission involving pakistan # somalia ( march 1992 to february 1996 ) somalia ( march 1992 to february 1996 ) ) in mogadishu inflicting over 80 casualty . fighting escalated until 19 american troop and more than 1,000 civilian and militia were killed in a battle of mogadishu ( 1993 ) during october 1993 . the un withdrew operation united shield on 3 march 1995 , having suffered significant casualty , and with the rule of government still not restored . in august 1996 , aidid wa killed in mogadishu . former un secretary general boutros boutros ghali and ahmedou ould abdallah , un special envoy to somalia have referred to the killing of civilian during the conflict a a `` genocide '' .
under the auspex of the un , au , arab league and igad , a series of additional national reconciliation conference were subsequently held a part of the peace process . among these summit were the 1997 national salvation council in sodere , ethiopia , the 1997 cairo peace conference / cairo declaration , the 2000 somalia national peace conference in arta , djibouti under the newly established transitional national government , the 2002 somali reconciliation conference in eldoret , kenya , the 2003 national reconciliation conference in nairobi , kenya when the transitional federal government wa established and the transitional federal charter wa adopted , the 2004 nairobi conference , and the 2007 national reconciliation conference in mogadishu .
following the outbreak of the civil war , many of somalia 's resident left in search of asylum . according to the unhcr , there were around 975,951 registered refugee from the country in neighboring state a of 2016 . additionally , 1.1 million people were internally displaced person ( idp ) . the majority of the idp were bantu ( somalia ) and other ethnic minority originating from the southern region , including those displaced in the north . an estimated 60 % of the idp were child . cause of the displacement included armed violence , periodic drought , and other natural disaster , which , along with diverted aid flow , hindered the idp ' access to safe shelter and resource . idp settlement were concentrated in south-central somalia ( 893,000 ) , followed by the northern puntland ( 129,000 ) and somaliland ( 84,000 ) region . additionally , there were around 9,356 registered refugee and 11,157 registered asylum seeker in somalia . most of these foreign national emigrated from yemen to berbera after the 2015 military intervention in yemen in 2015 . however , the majority of emigrant to somalia consist of somali expatriate , who have returned to mogadishu and other urban area for investment opportunity and to take part in the ongoing post-conflict reconstruction process .
a consequence of the collapse of governmental authority that accompanied the civil war wa the emergence of piracy in somalia in the unpatrolled indian ocean water off of the coast of somalia . the phenomenon partly arose a an attempt by local fisherman to protect their livelihood from illegal fishing by foreigner . in august 2008 , a multinational coalition , combined task force 150 , took on the task of combating the piracy by establishing a maritime security patrol area ( mspa ) within the gulf of aden . many ship owner have also hired private armed guard . by october 2012 , pirate attack had dropped to a six-year low , with only one ship attacked in the third quarter compared to 36 during the same period in 2011.
<section_title_start> transitional institutions <section_title_end>
the transitional national government ( tng ) wa established in aprilmay 2000 at the somalia national peace conference ( snpc ) held in arta , djibouti . abdiqasim salad hassan wa selected a the president of the nation 's new transitional national government ( tng ) , an interim administration formed to guide somalia to it third permanent republican government .
the tng 's internal problem led to the replacement of the prime minister four time in three year , and the administrative body 's reported bankruptcy in december 2003 . it mandate ended at the same time .
on 10 october 2004 , legislator elected abdullahi yusuf ahmed a the first president of the transitional federal government ( tfg ) , the transitional national government 's successor . the tfg wa the second interim administration aiming to restore national institution to somalia after the 1991 collapse of the siad barre regime and the ensuing civil war .
the transitional federal government ( tfg ) wa the internationally recognised government of somalia until 20 august 2012 , when it tenure officially ended . it wa established a one of the transitional federal institution ( tfis ) of government a defined in the transitional federal charter ( tfc ) adopted in november 2004 by the transitional federal parliament ( tfp ) . the transitional federal government officially comprised the executive ( government ) branch of government , with the tfp serving a the legislature branch . the government wa headed by the president of somalia , to whom the cabinet ( government ) reported through the prime minister of somalia . however , it wa also used a a general term to refer to all three branch collectively .
<section_title_start> islamic court union and ethiopian intervention <section_title_end>
in 2006 , the islamic court union ( icu ) , an islamism organization , assumed control of much of the southern part of the country and promptly imposed shari ' a . the transitional federal government sought to reestablish it authority , and , with the assistance of ethiopian national defense force , african union peacekeeper and air support by the united state , managed to drive out the rival icu and solidify it rule .
on 8 january 2007 , a the battle of ra kamboni raged , tfg president and founder abdullahi yusuf ahmed , a former colonel in the somali army and decorated war hero , entered mogadishu with the ethiopian military support for the first time since being elected to office . the government then relocated to villa somalia in the capital from it interim location in baidoa . this marked the first time since the fall of the siad barre regime in 1991 that the federal government controlled most of the country .
following this defeat , the islamic court union splintered into several different faction . some of the more radical element , including al-shabaab ( somalia ) al-shabaab , regrouped to continue their insurgency against the tfg and oppose the ethiopian military 's presence in somalia . throughout 2007 and 2008 , al-shabaab scored military victory , seizing control of key town and port in both central and southern somalia . at the end of 2008 , the group had captured baidoa but not mogadishu . by january 2009 , al-shabaab and other militia had managed to force the ethiopian troop to retreat , leaving behind an under-equipped african union peacekeeping force to assist the transitional federal government 's troop .
due to a lack of funding and human resource , an arm embargo that made it difficult to re-establish a national security force , and general indifference on the part of the international community , president yusuf found himself obliged to deploy thousand of troop from puntland to mogadishu to sustain the battle against insurgent element in the southern part of the country . financial support for this effort wa provided by the autonomous region 's government . this left little revenue for puntland 's own security force and civil service employee , leaving the territory vulnerable to piracy and terrorist attack .
on 29 december 2008 , abdullahi yusuf ahmed announced before a united parliament in baidoa his resignation a president of somalia . in his speech , which wa broadcast on national radio , yusuf expressed regret at failing to end the country 's seventeen-year conflict a his government had been mandated to do . he also blamed the international community for their failure to support the government , and said that the speaker of parliament would succeed him in office per the transitional federal charter of the somali republic .
<section_title_start> coalition government <section_title_end>
between 31 may and 9 june 2008 , representative of somalia 's federal government and the moderate alliance for the re-liberation of somalia ( ar ) group of islamist rebel participated in peace talk in djibouti brokered by the former united nation special envoy to somalia , ahmedou ould-abdallah . the conference ended with a signed agreement calling for the withdrawal of ethiopian troop in exchange for the cessation of armed confrontation . parliament wa subsequently expanded to 550 seat to accommodate ar member , which then elected sheikh sharif sheikh ahmed , the former ar chairman , to office . president sharif shortly afterwards appointed omar abdirashid ali sharmarke , the son of slain former president abdirashid ali sharmarke , a the nation 's new prime minister .
with the help of a small team of african union troop , the coalition government also began a somali civil war ( 2009present ) in february 2009 to assume full control of the southern half of the country . to solidify it rule , the tfg formed an alliance with the islamic court union , other member of the alliance for the re-liberation of somalia , and ahlu sunna waljama ' a , a moderate sufism militia . furthermore , al-shabaab and hizbul islam , the two main islamist group in opposition , began to fight amongst themselves in mid-2009 .
a a truce , in march 2009 , somalia 's coalition government announced that it would re-implement shari ' a a the nation 's official judicial system . however , conflict continued in the southern and central part of the country . within month , the coalition government had gone from holding about 70 % of south-central somalia 's conflict zone , territory that it had inherited from the previous yusuf administration , to losing control of over 80 % of the disputed territory to the islamist insurgent .

<section_title_start> etymology <section_title_end>
the country take it name from the lion mountain near freetown . originally named serra leoa ( portuguese language for `` lioness mountain '' ) by portuguese explorer pedro de sintra in 1462 , the modern name is derived from the italian language spelling , which wa introduced by republic of venice explorer alvise cadamosto and subsequently copied by other european cartography .
<section_title_start>  history of sierra leone  <section_title_end>
<section_title_start>  early history  <section_title_end>
archaeological find show that sierra leone ha been inhabited continuously for at least 2,500 year , populated successively by society who migrated from other part of africa . the use of iron wa adopted by the 9th century , and by 1000 ad , agriculture wa being practised along the coast . over time , the climate changed considerably , altering boundary between different ecological zone , affecting migration and conquest .
sierra leone 's dense tropical rainforest and swampy environment wa considered impenetrable ; it wa also host to the tsetse fly , which carried a disease fatal to horse and the zebu cattle used by the mande people . this environment protected it people from conquest by the mande and other african empire , and limited the influence of the mali empire . islam wa introduced by sosso empire trader , merchant and migrant from the north and east , becoming widely adopted in the 18th century .
<section_title_start> european trading <section_title_end>
european contact within sierra leone were among the first in west africa in the 15th century . in 1462 , portuguese discovery pedro de sintra mapped the hill surrounding what is now freetown harbour , naming the shaped formation serra da leoa or `` serra leoa '' ( portuguese language for lioness mountain ) . the spanish rendering of this geographic formation is sierra leona , which later wa adapted and , misspelled , became the country 's current name . although according to the professor c. magbaily fyle this could have been a misinterpretation of historian : according to him , there ha been evidence of traveller calling the region serra lyoa well before 1462 , the year when sintra first arrived . this would imply that the identity of the person who named sierra leone is unknown .
soon after sintra 's expedition , portuguese trader arrived at the harbour . by 1495 they had built a fortified trading post on the coast . the dutch republic and kingdom of france also set up trade here , and each nation used sierra leone a a trading point for slave brought by african trader from interior area undergoing war and conflict over territory . in 1562 , the kingdom of england initiated the triangle trade when admiral john hawkins ( naval commander ) of the royal navy transported 300 enslaved african  acquired `` by the sword and partly by other mean ''  to the spanish colony of santo domingo on hispaniola in the caribbean sea area of the west indie island , where he sold them .
<section_title_start>  early colony  <section_title_end>
in the late 18th century , many african-american claimed the protection of the british crown . there were thousand of these black loyalist , people of african descent who joined the british military force during the american revolutionary war . many of these loyalist ( american revolution ) had been slave who escaped to join the british , lured by promise of freedom ( emancipation ) . the official documentation known a the book of negro list thousand of freed slave whom the british evacuated from the nascent united state and resettled in colony elsewhere in british north america ( north to canada , or south to the west indie ) .
in 1787 the british crown founded a settlement in sierra leone in what wa called the `` province of freedom '' . it intended to resettle some of the `` black poor of london '' , some of whom were african-american freed by the british during the war . about 400 black and 60 white reached sierra leone on 15 may 1787 . the group also included some west indie of african descent from london . after they established granville town , most of the first group of colonist died , owing to disease and warfare with the indigenous african people ( temne people ) , who resisted their encroachment . the 64 ; remaining colonist established a second granville town .
following the american revolution , more than 3,000 black loyalist had also been settled in nova scotia , where they were finally granted land . they founded birchtown , nova scotia , but faced harsh winter and racial discrimination from nearby shelburne , nova scotia . thomas peter ( black leader ) pressed british authority for relief and more aid ; together with british abolitionist john clarkson ( abolitionist ) , the sierra leone company wa established to relocate black loyalist who wanted to take their chance in west africa . in 1792 nearly 1200 ; person from nova scotia crossed the atlantic to build the second ( and only permanent ) colony of sierra leone and the settlement of freetown on 11 march 1792 . in sierra leone they were called the nova scotian settler , the nova scotians , or the settler .
the settler built freetown in the style they knew from their life in the american south ; they also continued american fashion and american manner . in addition , many continued to practise methodism in freetown . black settler in sierra leone enjoyed much more autonomy in that they were more politically engaged . black immigrant elected different level of political representative , 'tithingmen ' , who represented each dozen settler , and 'hundreders ' who represented larger amount . this sort of representation wa not available in nova scotia . the initial process of society-building in freetown , however , wa a harsh struggle . the crown did not supply enough basic supply and provision , and the settler were continually threatened by illegal slave trading and the risk of re-enslavement . in the 1790s , the settler , including adult woman , voted for the first time in election . the sierra leone company , controlled by london investor , refused to allow the settler to take fee simple of the land . in 1799 some of the settler revolted . the crown subdued the revolt by bringing in force of more than 500 ; jamaican maroon , whom they transported from cudjoe 's town ( trelawny town ) via nova scotia in 1800 . led by colonel montague james , the maroon helped the colonial force to put down the revolt , and in the process the jamaican maroon in sierra leone secured the best house and farm .
on 1 january 1808 , thomas ludlam ( colonialist ) , the governor of the sierra leone company and a leading abolitionist , surrendered the company 's charter . this ended it 16 ; year of running the colony . the british crown reorganised the sierra leone company a the african institution ; it wa directed to improve the local economy . it member represented both british who hoped to inspire local entrepreneur and those with interest in the macauley & babington company , which held the ( british ) monopoly on sierra leone trade .
at about the same time ( following the slave trade act 1807 ) , british crew delivered thousand of formerly enslaved african to freetown , after liberating them from illegal slave ship . these liberated african or recaptives were sold for $ 20 a head a apprentice to the white settler , nova scotian settler , and the jamaican maroon . some of the recaptives who were not sold a apprentice were forced to join the navy . many recaptives were treated poorly and even abused because some of the original settler considered them their property . cut off from their various homeland and tradition , the liberated african were forced to assimilate to the western style of settler and maroon . for example , some of the recaptives were forced to change their name to a more western sounding one . though some people happily embraced these change because they considered it a being part of the community , some were not happy with these change and wanted to keep their own identity . many recaptives were so unhappy that they risked the possibility of being sold back into slavery by leaving sierra leone and going back to their original village . they built a flourishing trade in flower and bead on the west african coast .
these returned african were from many area of africa , but principally the west coast . during the 19th century , freed black american , some americo liberian 'refugees ' , and particularly west indian , also immigrated and settled in freetown . together these people created a new creole ethnicity called the krio people ( initially called creole ) and a trading language , krio language , which became commonly used among many of the ethnicity in the country .
<section_title_start>  colonial era ( 18001961 )  <section_title_end>
the settlement of sierra leone in the 1800s wa unique in that the population wa composed of displaced african who were brought to the colony after the british abolition of the slave trade in 1807 . upon arrival in sierra leone , each `` recaptive '' wa given a registration number , and information on their physical quality would be entered into the register of liberated african . however , oftentimes the documentation would be overwhelmingly subjective and would result in inaccurate entry , making them difficult to track . in addition , difference between the register of liberated african of 1808 and the list of captured negro of 1812 ( which emulated the 1808 document ) revealed some disparity in the entry of the recaptives , specifically in the name ; many recaptives decided to change their given name to more anglicised version which contributed to the difficulty in tracking them after they arrived in sierra leone .
according to the british act for the abolition of the slave trade in 1807 , the recaptives could be subject to apprenticeship led by british colonist in sierra leone and the male enlisted into the army or navy . in many instance , the recaptives who were assigned to apprenticeship were sold for $ 20 , giving the apprenticeship system quality similar to slavery . it is documented that the recaptive apprentice were unpaid and the settler who they were appointed to had device which could be used to discipline them , namely stick . according to suzanne schwartz , a historian on colonial sierra leone , in june 1808 a group of 21 men and woman ran away to the nearby native settlement of robiss and upon recapture were imprisoned by the settler in sierra leone , thus contributing to the slavery-like quality of the apprenticeship system .
in the early 19th century , freetown served a the residence of the british colonial governor of the region , who also administered the gold coast ( british colony ) ( now ghana ) and the gambia settlement . sierra leone developed a the educational centre of british west africa . the british established fourah bay college here in 1827 , which rapidly became a magnet for english-speaking african on the west coast . for more than a century , it wa the only european-style university in western sub-saharan africa .
the british interacted mostly with the krios in freetown , who did most of the trading with the indigenous people of the interior . in addition , educated krios held numerous position in the colonial government , giving them status and well-paying position . following the berlin conference of 18841885 , the uk decided that it needed to establish more dominion over the inland area , to satisfy what wa described by the european power a `` effective occupation '' of territory . in 1896 it annexed these area , declaring them the sierra leone protectorate . with this change , the british began to expand their administration in the region , recruiting british citizen to post , and pushing krios out of position in government and even the desirable residential area in freetown .
during the british annexation to sierra leone , there were several chief in the northern and southern part of the country who were also resisting the hut tax war but they used diplomacy to achieve their goal . to the north , from 1820 to 1906 there wa a limba chief named almamy suluku who ruled his territory for many year , fighting different tribe to protect his territory , while at the same time using diplomacy to trick the protectorate and sending fighter to assist bai bureh . http : //www.sierra-leone.org/heroes/heroes5.html .
another prominent figure in sierra leone history is bai sherbro ( ) . bai sherbro wa a chief and warrior in bonte island , which is in the southwestern part of the country . he , like bai bureh , exercised resistance to the british . bai sherbro also sent fighter to bai bureh  s camp to help him fight against the british . bai sherbro wa influential and powerful , so the british greatly feared him . bai sherbro wa subsequently captured , and along with bai bureh exiled to the gold coast , which is now modern day ghana . http : //www.sierra-leone.org/heroes/heroes5.html .
nyagua , ( ) , also known a the tracking king , wa a fierce king who captured many district and many came to join him for protection . nyagua wa also resistant to the british cause . however , nyagua , realizing that he lacked sufficient strength , attempted to use diplomacy . at the same time , he sent warrior to assist bai bureh to fight against the british . the british later captured nyagua , and he wa also exiled to the gold coast . http : //www.sierra-leone.org/heroes/heroes5.html .
madam yoko , ( ) wa a brilliant woman of culture and ambition . she employed her capacity for friendly communication to persuade the british to give her control of the kpaa mende chiefdom . she used diplomacy to communicate with many local chief who did not trust her friendship with the british . because madam yoko supported the british , some sub-chiefs rebelled , causing yoko to take refuge in the police barrack . for her loyalty , she wa awarded a silver medal by queen victoria . until 1906 madam yoko ruled a a paramount chief in the new british protectorate . sadly , it appears that she committed suicide at the age of fifty-five , perhaps due to the loss of support from her own people . http : //www.sierra-leone.org/heroes/heroes5.html .
in addition , the british annexation of the protectorate interfered with the sovereignty of indigenous chief . they designated chief a unit of local government , rather than dealing with them individually a had been the previous practice . they did not maintain relationship even with longtime ally , such a bai bureh , chief of kasseh , a community on the small scarcies river . he wa later unfairly portrayed a a prime instigator of the hut tax war in 1898.
colonel frederic cardew , military governor of the protectorate , in 1898 established a new tax on dwelling and demanded that the chief use their people to maintain road . the tax were often higher than the value of the dwelling , and 24 chief signed a petition to cardew , stating how destructive this wa ; their people could not afford to take time off from their subsistence agriculture . they resisted payment of tax . tension over the new colonial requirement , and the administration 's suspicion towards the chief , led to the hut tax war of 1898 , also called the temne-mende war . the british fired first . the northern front of majority temne people wa led by bai bureh . the southern front , consisting mostly of mende people , entered the conflict somewhat later for other reason .
for several month , bureh 's fighter had the advantage over the vastly more powerful british force , but the british troop and bureh 's warrior suffered hundred of fatality . bai bureh finally surrendered on 11 november 1898 to end the destruction of his people 's territory and dwelling . although the british government recommended leniency , cardew insisted on sending the chief and two ally into exile in the gold coast ; his government hanged 96 of the chief 's warrior . bai bureh wa allowed to return in 1905 , when he resumed his chieftaincy of kasseh .
the defeat of the temne and mende in the hut tax war ended mass resistance to the protectorate and colonial government , but intermittent rioting and labour unrest continued throughout the colonial period . riot in 1955 and 1956 involved `` many ten of thousand '' of sierra leonians in the protectorate .
domestic slavery in africa , which continued to be practised by local african elite , wa abolished in 1928 . a notable event in 1935 wa the granting of a monopoly on mineral mining to the sierra leone selection trust , run by de beer . the monopoly wa scheduled to last 98 year . mining of diamond in the east and other mineral expanded , drawing labourer there from other part of the country .
in 1924 , the uk government divided sierra leone into a colony and a protectorate , with different political system constitutionally defined for each . the colony wa freetown and it coastal area ; the protectorate wa defined a the hinterland area dominated by local chief . antagonism between the two entity escalated to a heated debate in 1947 , when proposal were introduced to provide for a single political system for both the colony and the protectorate . most of the proposal came from leader of the protectorate , whose population far outnumbered that in the colony . the krios , led by i. t. a. wallace-johnson isaac wallace-johnson , opposed the proposal , a they would have resulted in reducing the political power of the krios in the colony .
in 1951 , educated protectorate leader from different group , including sir milton margai , lamina sankoh , siaka stevens , mohamed sanusi mustapha , john karefa-smart , kande bureh , sir albert margai , amadu wurie and sir banja tejan-sie joined together with the powerful paramount chief in the protectorate to form the sierra leone people 's party or slpp a the party of the protectorate . the slpp leadership , led by sir milton margai , negotiated with the british and the educated krio-dominated colony based in freetown to achieve independence .
owing to the astute politics of milton margai of the mende people , the educated protectorate elite wa won over to join force with the paramount chief in the face of krio intransigence . later , margai used the same skill to win over opposition leader and moderate krio element to achieve independence from the uk . in november 1951 , margai oversaw the drafting of a new constitution , which united the separate colonial and protectorate legislature and provided a framework for decolonisation . in 1953 , sierra leone wa granted local ministerial power and margai wa elected chief minister of sierra leone . the new constitution ensured sierra leone a parliamentary system within the commonwealth of nation . in may 1957 , sierra leone held it first parliamentary election . the slpp , which wa then the most popular political party in the colony of sierra leone a well a being supported by the powerful paramount chief in the province , won the most seat in parliament and margai wa re-elected a chief minister by a landslide .
<section_title_start>  1960 independence conference  <section_title_end>
on 20 april 1960 , milton margai led a 24-member sierra leonean delegation at constitutional conference that were held with the government of queen elizabeth ii and british colonial secretary iain macleod in negotiation for independence held in london .
on the conclusion of talk in london on 4 may 1960 , the united kingdom agreed to grant sierra leone independence on 27 april 1961.
<section_title_start>  independence ( 1961 ) and margai administration ( 19611964 )  <section_title_end>
on 27 april 1961 , sir milton margai led sierra leone to independence from great britain and became the country 's first prime minister . thousand of sierra leoneans took to the street in celebration . the dominion of sierra leone retained a parliamentary system of government and wa a member of the commonwealth of nation . the leader of the main opposition all people 's congress ( apc ) , siaka stevens , along with isaac wallace-johnson , another outspoken critic of the slpp government , were arrested and placed under [ arrest ] in freetown , along with sixteen others charged with disrupting the independence celebration .
in may 1962 , sierra leone held it sierra leonean general election , 1962 a an independent nation . the sierra leone people 's party ( slpp ) won a plurality ( voting ) of seat in parliament , and milton margai wa re-elected a prime minister .
margai wa very popular among sierra leoneans during his time in power , most known for his self-effacement . he wa neither corrupt nor did he make a lavish display of his power or status . he based the government on the rule of law and the separation of power , with multiparty political institution and fairly viable representative structure . margai used his conservative ideology to lead sierra leone without much strife . he appointed government official to represent various ethnic group . margai employed a brokerage style of politics , by sharing political power among political party and interest group ; and with the powerful paramount chief in the province , most of whom were key ally of his government .
<section_title_start> final year of democracy ( 19641967 )  <section_title_end>
upon milton margai 's unexpected death in 1964 , his [ sir albert margai ] , wa appointed a prime minister by parliament . sir albert 's leadership wa briefly challenged by foreign minister [ [ john karefa-smart , who questioned sir albert 's succession to the slpp leadership position . karefa-smart led a prominent small minority faction within the slpp party in opposition of albert margai a prime minister . however , karefa-smart failed to receive strong support within the slpp and the slpp dominated member of parliament in his attempt to have albert margai stripped of his position a the leader of the slpp and prime minister of the country . the large majority of slpp member backed albert margai over karefa-smart . soon after albert margai wa sworn in a prime minister , he dismissed several senior government official who had served under his elder brother milton 's government , viewing them a a threat to his administration , including karefa-smart .
sir albert resorted to increasingly authoritarian action in response to protest and enacted several law against the opposition all people 's congress ( apc ) , whilst attempting to establish a one-party state . sir albert wa opposed to the colonial legacy of allowing executive power to the paramount chief , many of whom had been key ally of his late brother sir milton . accordingly , they began to consider sir albert a threat to the ruling house across the country . margai appointed many non-creoles to the country 's civil service in freetown , in an overall diversification of the civil service in the capital , which had been dominated by member of the creole ethnic group . a a result , albert margai became unpopular in the creole community , many of whom had supported sir milton . margai wa accused of favouring member of his own mende ethnic group for prominent position .
in 1967 , riot broke out in freetown against margai 's policy ; in response he declared a state of emergency across the country . sir albert wa accused of corruption and of a policy of affirmative action in favour of his own mende people ethnic group . although possessing the full backing of the country 's security force , he called for free and fair election .
<section_title_start>  military coup ( 19671968 )  <section_title_end>
the apc , with it leader siaka stevens , narrowly won a small majority of seat in parliament over the slpp in a closely contested sierra leonean general election , 1967 . stevens wa sworn in a prime minister on 21 march 1967.
within hour after taking office , stevens wa ousted in a bloodless military coup led by brigadier general david lansana , the commander of the republic of sierra leone armed force . he wa a close ally of albert margai , who had appointed him to the position in 1964 . lansana placed stevens under [ arrest ] in freetown and insisted that the determination of prime minister should await the election of the tribal representative to the house . upon his release , stevens went into exile in guinea .
on 23 march 1967 , a group of military officer in the sierra leone army led by brigadier general andrew juxon-smith , overrode this action by a coup d'tat ; they seized control of the government , arresting lansana , and suspending the constitution . the group set up the national reformation council ( nrc ) , with andrew juxon-smith a it chairman and head of state of the country .
on 18 april 1968 a group of low ranking soldier in the sierra leone army who called themselves the anti-corruption revolutionary movement ( acrm ) , led by brigadier general john amadu bangura , sergeant ' coup ( sierra leone ) the nrc military junta . the acrm junta arrested many senior nrc member . they reinstated the constitution and returned power to stevens , who at last assumed the office of prime minister .
<section_title_start>  one-party state ( 19681991 )  <section_title_end>
stevens assumed power again in 1968 with a great deal of hope and ambition . much trust wa placed upon him a he championed multiparty politics . stevens had campaigned on a platform of bringing the tribe together under socialist principle . during his first decade or so in power , stevens renegotiated some of what he called `` useless prefinanced scheme '' contracted by his predecessor , both albert margai of the slpp and juxon-smith of the nrc . some of these policy by the slpp and the nrc were said to have left the country in an economically deprived state .
stevens reorganised the country 's oil refinery , the government-owned cape sierra hotel , and a cement factory . he cancelled juxon-smith 's construction of a church and mosque on the ground of victoria park ( since mid 2017 freetown amusement park ) . stevens began effort that would later bridge the distance between the province and the city . road and hospital were constructed in the province , and paramount chief and provincial people became a prominent force in freetown .
under pressure of several coup attempt , real or perceived , stevens ' rule grew more and more authoritarian , and his relationship with some of his ardent supporter deteriorated . he removed the slpp party from competitive politics in general election , some believed , through the use of violence and intimidation . to maintain the support of the military , stevens retained the popular john amadu bangura a head of the sierra leone armed force .
after the return to civilian rule , by-election were held ( beginning in autumn 1968 ) and an all-apc cabinet wa appointed . calm wa not completely restored . in november 1968 , unrest in the province led stevens to declare a state of emergency across the country . many senior officer in the sierra leone army were greatly disappointed with stevens ' policy and his handling of the sierra leone military , but none could confront stevens . brigadier general bangura , who had reinstated stevens a prime minister , wa widely considered the only person who could control stevens . the army wa devoted to bangura , and this made him potentially dangerous to stevens . in january 1970 , bangura wa arrested and charged with conspiracy ( crime ) and plotting to commit a coup against the stevens government . after a trial that lasted a few month , bangura wa convicted and capital punishment . on 29 march 1970 , brigadier bangura wa executed by hanging in freetown .
after the execution of bangura , a group of soldier loyal to the executed general held a mutiny in freetown and other part of the country in opposition to stevens ' government . dozen of soldier were arrested and convicted by a court martial in freetown for their participation in the mutiny against the president . among the soldier arrested wa a little-known army corporal , foday sankoh , a strong bangura supporter . corporal sankoh wa convicted and jailed for seven year at the pademba road prison in freetown .
in april 1971 , a new republican constitution wa adopted under which stevens became president . in the 1972 by-election , the opposition slpp complained of intimidation and procedural obstruction by the apc and militia . these problem became so severe that the slpp boycotted the sierra leonean general election , 1973 ; a a result the apc won 84 of the 85 elected seat .
an alleged plot to overthrow president stevens failed in 1974 and it leader were executed . in mid-1974 , guinean soldier , a requested by stevens , were stationed in the country to help maintain his hold on power , a stevens wa a close ally of then-guinean president ahmed sekou toure . in march 1976 , stevens wa elected without opposition for a second five-year term a president . on 19 july 1975 , 14 senior army and government official , including david lansana , former cabinet minister mohamed sorie forna ( father of writer aminatta forna ) , brigadier general ibrahim bash taqi and lieutenant habib lansana kamara were executed after being convicted of attempting a coup to topple president stevens ' government .
in 1977 , a nationwide student demonstration against the government disrupted sierra leone politics . the demonstration wa quickly put down by the army and stevens ' own personal special security division ( ssd ) , a heavily armed paramilitary force he had created to protect him and maintain his hold on power . ssd officer were very loyal to stevens and were deployed across sierra leone to put down any rebellion or protest against stevens ' government . sierra leonean parliamentary election , 1977 wa called later that year in which corruption wa again endemic ; the apc won 74 seat and the slpp 15 . in 1978 , the apc-dominant parliament approved a new constitution making the country a one-party state . the 1978 constitution made the apc the only legal political party in sierra leone . this move led to another major demonstration against the government in many part of the country , but it wa also put down by the army and stevens ' ssd force .
stevens is generally criticised for dictatorial method and government corruption , but on a positive note , he kept the country stable and from collapsing into civil war . he created several government institution that are still in use today . stevens also reduced ethnic polarisation in government by incorporating member of various ethnic group into his all-dominant apc government .
siaka stevens retired from politics in november 1985 after being in power for eighteen year . the apc named a new presidential candidate to succeed stevens at it last delegate conference , held in freetown in november 1985 . the candidate wa major general joseph saidu momoh , head of the sierra leone armed force and stevens ' own choice to succeed him . a head of the armed force , general momoh had been very loyal to stevens , who had appointed him to the position . like stevens , momoh wa also a member of the minority limba people ( sierra leone ) ethnic group .
a the sole candidate , momoh wa elected president without opposition and sworn in a sierra leone 's second president on 28 november 1985 in freetown . a one-party parliamentary election between apc member wa held in may 1986 . president momoh appointed his former military colleague and key ally , major general mohamed tarawalie to succeed him a the head of the sierra leone military . general tarawalie wa also a strong loyalist and key momoh supporter . president momoh named james bambay kamara a the head of the sierra leone police . bambay kamara wa also a strong momoh loyalist and supporter . momoh broke from former president siaka stevens by integrating the powerful ssd into the sierra leone police a a special paramilitary force . under president stevens , the ssd had been a powerful personal force used to maintain his hold on power , independent from the sierra leone military and sierra leone police force . the sierra leone police under bambay kamara 's leadership , wa accused of physical violence , arrest and intimidation against critic of president momoh 's government .
president momoh 's strong link with the army and his verbal attack on corruption earned him much-needed initial support among sierra leoneans . with the lack of new face in the new apc cabinet under president momoh and the return of many of the old face from stevens ' government , criticism soon arose that momoh wa simply perpetuating the rule of stevens .
the next few year under the momoh administration were characterised by corruption , which momoh defused by sacking several senior cabinet minister . to formalise his war against corruption , president momoh announced a `` code of conduct for political leader and public servant '' . after an alleged attempt to overthrow president momoh in march 1987 , more than 60 senior government official were arrested , including vice-president francis minah , who wa removed from office , convicted of plotting the coup , and executed by [ in 1989 , along with five others .
<section_title_start>  sierra leone civil war ( 19912002 )  <section_title_end>
in october 1990 , owing to mounting pressure from both within and outside the country for political and economic reform , president momoh set up a constitutional review commission to ass the 1978 one-party constitution . based on the commission 's recommendation a constitution re-establishing a multiparty system wa approved by the exclusive apc parliament by a 60 % majority vote , becoming effective on 1 october 1991 . there wa great suspicion that president momoh wa not serious about his promise of political reform , a apc rule continued to be increasingly marked by abuse of power .
the brutal civil war that wa going on in neighbouring liberia ] played a significant role in the outbreak of fighting in sierra leone . [ [ charles taylor ( liberia )  then leader of the national patriotic front of liberia  reportedly helped form the revolutionary united front revolutionary united front ( ruf ) under the command of former sierra leonean army corporal foday sankoh , an ethnic temne from tonkolili district in northern sierra leone . sankoh wa a british trained former army corporal who had also undergone guerrilla training in libya . taylor 's aim wa for the ruf to attack the base of nigerian dominated peacekeeping troop in sierra leone who were opposed to his rebel movement in liberia .

<section_title_start> etymology <section_title_end>
bahrayn is the dual form of arabic bahr ( `` sea '' ) , so al-bahrayn originally mean `` the two sea '' . however , the name ha been lexicalised a a feminine proper noun and doe not follow the grammatical rule for duals ; thus it form is always bahrayn and never bahrn , the expected nominative form . ending are added to the word with no change , a in the name of the national anthem bahraynun ( `` our bahrain '' ) or the demonym bahrayn . the medieval grammarian ismail ibn hammad al-jawhari al-jawahari commented on this saying that the more formally correct term bahr ( lit . `` belonging to the sea '' ) would have been misunderstood and so wa unused .
it remains disputed which `` two sea '' the name bahrayn originally refers to . the term appears five time in the quran , but doe not refer to the modern islandoriginally known to the arab a awalbut , rather , to all of eastern arabia ( most notably al-katif and al-ahsa oasis al-hasa ) .
today , bahrain 's `` two sea '' are generally taken to be the bay east and west of the island , the sea north and south of the island , or the salt and fresh water present above and below the ground . in addition to well , there are area of the sea north of bahrain where fresh water bubble up in the middle of the saltwater a noted by visitor since antiquity . an alternate theory with regard to bahrain 's toponymy is offered by the al-ahsa region , which suggests that the two sea were the persian gulf ( the persian gulf ) and a al-asfar lake on the arabian mainland .
until the late middle age , `` bahrain '' referred to the eastern arabia that included southern iraq , kuwait , al-ahsa oasis al-hasa , qatif , and bahrain . the region stretched from basra in iraq to the strait of hormuz in oman . this wa iqlm al-bahrayn 's `` bahrayn province . '' the exact date at which the term `` bahrain '' began to refer solely to the awal archipelago is unknown . the entire coastal strip of eastern arabia wa known a `` bahrain '' for a millennium . the island and kingdom were also commonly spelled bahrein into the 1950s .

<section_title_start> antiquity <section_title_end>
bahrain wa home to dilmun , an important bronze age trade centre linking mesopotamia and the indus river . bahrain wa later ruled by the assyrian people and babylonian .
from the sixth to third century bc , bahrain wa part of the achaemenid empire . by about 250 bc , parthia brought the persian gulf under it control and extended it influence a far a oman . the parthian established garrison along the southern coast of the persian gulf to control trade route .
during the classical era , bahrain wa referred to by the ancient greek a tylos , the centre of pearl trading , when the greek admiral nearchus serving under alexander the great landed on bahrain . nearchus is believed to have been the first of alexander 's commander to visit the island , and he found a verdant land that wa part of a wide trading network ; he recorded : `` that on the island of tylos , situated in the persian gulf , are large plantation of cotton tree , from which are manufactured clothes called sindones , of strongly differing degree of value , some being costly , others le expensive . the use of these is not confined to india , but extends to arabia . '' the greek historian theophrastus state that much of bahrain wa covered by these cotton tree and that bahrain wa famous for exporting walking cane engraved with emblem that were customarily carried in babylon .
alexander had planned to settle greek colonist in bahrain , and although it is not clear that this happened on the scale he envisaged , bahrain became very much part of the hellenised world : the language of the upper class wa greek ( although aramaic language wa in everyday use ) , while zeus wa worshipped in the form of the arabian sun-god sham ( goddess ) . bahrain even became the site of greek athletic contest .
the greek historian strabo believed the phoenician originated from bahrain . herodotus also believed that the homeland of the phoenician wa bahrain . this theory wa accepted by the 19th-century german classicist arnold heeren who said that : `` in the greek geographer , for instance , we read of two island , named tyrus or tylos , and arad , bahrain , which boasted that they were the mother country of the phoenician , and exhibited relic of phoenician temple . '' the people of tyre , lebanon , in particular , have long maintained persian gulf origin , and the similarity in the word `` tylos '' and `` tyre '' ha been commented upon . however , there is little evidence of any human settlement at all on bahrain during the time when such migration had supposedly taken place .
the name tylos is thought to be a hellenisation of the semitic tilmun ( from dilmun ) . the term tylos wa commonly used for the island until ptolemy 's geographia ( ptolemy ) when the inhabitant are referred to a thilouanoi . some place name in bahrain go back to the tylos era ; for instance the name of arad , a residential suburb of muharraq , is believed to originate from `` arados '' , the ancient greek name for muharraq .
in the 3rd century , ardashir i , the first ruler of the sassanid dynasty , marched on oman and bahrain , where he defeated sanatruq the ruler of bahrain . at this time , bahrain wa known a mishmahig ( which in pahlavi language middle-persian/pahlavi mean `` ewe-fish '' ) .
bahrain wa also the site of worship of an ox deity called awal (  links=no ) worshiper built a large statue to awal in muharraq , although it ha now been lost . for many century after tylos , bahrain wa known a awal . by the 5th century , bahrain became a centre for nestorianism , with the village samahij a the seat of bishop . in 410 , according to the oriental syriac church synodal record , a bishop named batai wa excommunicated from the church in bahrain . a a sect , the nestorian were often persecuted a heretic by the byzantine empire , but bahrain wa outside the empire 's control , offering some safety . the name of several muharraq village today reflect bahrain 's christian legacy , with al dair meaning `` the monastery '' .
bahrain 's pre-islamic population consisted of arab christian ( mostly abd al-qays ) , persian ( zoroastrian ) , history of the jew in bahrain # early history , and aramaic language-speaking agriculturalist . according to robert bertram serjeant , the baharna may be the arabization `` descendant of convert from the original population of christian ( aramaean ) , jew and persian inhabiting the island and cultivated coastal province of eastern arabia at the time of the muslim conquest '' . the sedentary people of pre-islamic bahrain were aramaic language # geographic distribution and to some degree persian speaker , while syriac language functioned a a sacred language .

<section_title_start> middle ages <section_title_end>
in 899 , the qarmatians , a millenarianism isma'ilism muslim sect , seized bahrain , seeking to create a utopian society based on reason and redistribution of property among initiate . thereafter , the qarmatians demanded tribute from the caliph in baghdad , and in 930 sacked mecca and medina , bringing the sacred black stone back to their base in bahrain ( historical region ) , in medieval bahrain , for ransom . according to historian al-juwayni , the stone wa returned 22 year later in 951 under mysterious circumstance . wrapped in a sack , it wa thrown into the great mosque of kufa in iraq , accompanied by a note saying `` by command we took it , and by command we have brought it back . '' the theft and removal of the black stone caused it to break into seven piece .
following their 976 defeat by the abbasid caliphate , the qarmatians were overthrown by the arab uyunid dynasty of al-ahsa oasis al-hasa , who took over the entire bahrain region in 1076. though locally the island were controlled by the shi'ite jarwanids jarwanid ] dynasty of [ [ qatif .
in the mid-15th century , the archipelago came under the rule of the jabrids , a bedouin dynasty also based in al-ahsa oasis al-ahsa that ruled most of eastern arabia .
<section_title_start> early modern era <section_title_end>
in 1521 , the portuguese empire allied with hormuz and seized bahrain from the jabrids ruler muqrin ibn zamil , who wa killed during the takeover . portuguese rule lasted for around 80 year , during which time they depended mainly on sunni islam persian governor . the portuguese were expelled from the island in 1602 by abbas i of persia of the safavid empire , which gave impetus to shia islam . for the next two century , persian ruler retained control of the archipelago , interrupted by the 1717 and 1738 invasion of the ibadis of oman . during most of this period , they resorted to governing bahrain indirectly , either through the city of bushehr or through immigration sunni arab clan . the latter were tribe returning to the arabian side of the persian gulf from persian territory in the north who were known a huwala . in 1753 , the huwala clan of nasr al-madhkur invaded bahrain on behalf of the iranian zand dynasty leader karim khan zand and restored direct iranian rule .
in 1783 , al-madhkur lost the island of bahrain following his defeat by the ban utbah tribe at the 1782 battle of zubarah . bahrain wa not new territory to the ban utbah ; they had been a presence there since the 17th century . during that time , they started purchasing date palm garden in bahrain ; a document show that 81 year before arrival of the al-khalifa , one of the sheikh of the al bin ali tribe ( an offshoot of the ban utbah ) had bought a palm garden from mariam bint ahmed al sanadi in sitra island .
the al bin ali were the dominant group controlling the town of zubarah on the qatar peninsula , originally the center of power of the ban utbah . after the ban utbah gained control of bahrain , the al bin ali had a practically independent status there a a self-governing tribe . they used a flag with four red and three white stripe , called the al-sulami flag in bahrain , qatar , kuwait , and the eastern province of the kingdom of saudi arabia . later , different arab family clan and tribe from qatar moved to bahrain to settle after the fall of nasr al-madhkur of bushehr . these family included the house of khalifa , al-ma'awdah , al-fadhil , al-mannai , al-noaimi , al-sulaiti , al-sadah , al-thawadi and other family and tribe .
the house of khalifa moved from qatar to bahrain in 1799 . originally , their ancestor were expelled from umm qasr in central arabia by the ottoman empire due to their predatory habit of preying on caravan in basra and trading ship in shatt al-arab waterway until turk expelled them to kuwait in 1716 , where they remained until 1766.
around the 1760s , the al jalahma and house of khalifa , both belonging to the utub federation , migrated to zubarah in modern-day qatar , leaving al sabah a the sole proprietor of kuwait .
<section_title_start> 19th century and later <section_title_end>
in the early 19th century , bahrain wa invaded by both the omani and the house of saud . in 1802 it wa governed by a 12-year-old child , when the omani ruler sayyid sultan installed his son , salim , a governor in the arad fort . in 1816 , the british political resident in the persian gulf , william bruce , received a letter from the sheikh of bahrain who wa concerned about a rumour that britain would support an attack on the island by the imam of muscat . he sailed to bahrain to reassure the sheikh that this wa not the case and drew up an informal agreement assuring the sheikh that britain would remain a neutral party .
in 1820 , the al khalifa tribe were recognised by the united kingdom a the ruler ( `` al-hakim '' in arabic ) of bahrain after signing a general maritime treaty of 1820 . however , ten year later they were forced to pay yearly tribute to egypt despite seeking persian and british protection .
in 1860 , the al khalifas used the same tactic when the british tried to overpower bahrain . writing letter to the persian and ottoman empire , al khalifas agreed to place bahrain under the latter 's protection in march due to offering better condition . eventually the british raj overpowered bahrain when the persian refused to protect it . colonel lewis pelly signed a new treaty with al khalifas placing bahrain under british rule and protection .
following the qataribahraini war in 1868 , british representative signed another agreement with the al khalifas . it specified that the ruler could not dispose of any of his territory except to the united kingdom and could not enter into relationship with any foreign government without british consent . in return the british promised to protect bahrain from all aggression by sea and to lend support in case of land attack . more importantly the british promised to support the rule of the al khalifa in bahrain , securing it unstable position a ruler of the country . other agreement in 1880 and 1892 sealed the protectorate status of bahrain to the british .
unrest amongst the people of bahrain began when britain officially established complete dominance over the territory in 1892 . the first revolt and widespread uprising took place in march 1895 against sheikh issa bin ali , then ruler of bahrain . sheikh issa wa the first of the al khalifa to rule without persian relation . arnold wilson , britain 's representative in the persian gulf and author of the persian gulf , arrived in bahrain from muscat at this time . the uprising developed further with some protester killed by british force .
before the development of petroleum , the island wa largely devoted to pearl hunting and , a late a the 19th century , wa considered to be the finest in the world . in 1903 , german explorer , hermann burchardt , visited bahrain and took many photograph of historical site , including the old qar es-sheikh , photo now stored at the ethnological museum of berlin . prior to the world war i , there were about 400 vessel hunting pearl and an annual export of more than 30,000 .
in 1911 , a group of bahraini merchant demanded restriction on the british influence in the country . the group 's leader were subsequently arrested and exiled to india . in 1923 , the british introduced bahrain administrative reform of the 1920s and replaced sheikh issa bin ali with his son . some clerical opponent and family such a dawasir left or were exiled to saudi arabia and iran . three year later the british placed the country under the de facto rule of charles belgrave who operated a an adviser to the ruler until 1957 . belgrave brought a number of reform such a establishment of the country 's first modern school in 1919 , the persian gulf 's first girl ' school in 1928 and the abolition of arab slave trade in 1937 . at the same time , the pearl diving industry developed at a rapid pace .
in 1927 , rez shh , then shah of iran , demanded sovereignty over bahrain in a letter to the league of nation , a move that prompted belgrave to undertake harsh measure including encouraging conflict between shia islam and sunni muslim in order to bring down the uprising and limit the iranian influence . belgrave even went further by suggesting to rename the persian gulf to the `` arabian gulf '' ; however , the proposal wa refused by the british government . britain 's interest in bahrain 's development wa motivated by concern over saudi and iranian ambition in the region .
the bahrain petroleum company ( bapco ) , a subsidiary of the standard oil company of california ( socal ) , discovered oil in 1932 . this wa to bring rapid modernisation to bahrain . relation with the united kingdom became closer , a evidenced by the british royal navy moving it entire middle eastern command from bushehr in iran to bahrain in 1935.

neolithic agricultural settlement ( c. 55003500 bc ) , such a those at norovlin , tamsagbulag , bayanzag , and rashaan khad , predated the introduction of horse-riding nomadism , a pivotal event in the history of mongolia which became the dominant culture . horse-riding nomadism ha been documented by archeological evidence in mongolia during the copper and bronze age afanasevo culture ( 35002500 bc ) ; this culture wa active to the khangai mountain in central mongolia . the wheeled vehicle found in the burial of the afanasevans have been dated to before 2200 bc . pastoral nomadism and metalworking became more developed with the later okunev culture ( 2nd millennium bc ) , andronovo culture ( 23001000 bc ) and karasuk culture ( 1500300 bc ) , culminating with the iron age xiongnu empire in 209 bc . monument of the pre-xiongnu bronze age include deer stone , keregsur kurgans , slab grave culture , and rock painting .
although cultivation of crop ha continued since the neolithic , agriculture ha always remained small in scale compared to pastoral nomadism . agriculture may have first been introduced from the west or arose independently in the region . the population during the copper age ha been described a mongoloid in the east of what is now mongolia , and a europoid in the west . tocharian ( yuezhi ) and scythian inhabited western mongolia during the bronze age . the mummy of a scythian warrior , which is believed to be about 2,500 year old , wa a 30- to 40-year-old man with blond hair ; it wa found in altai mountain , mongolia . a equine nomadism wa introduced into mongolia , the political center of the eurasian steppe also shifted to mongolia , where it remained until the 18th century ce . the intrusion of northern pastoralists ( e.g . the guifang , shanrong , and donghu people ) into china during the shang dynasty ( 16001046 bc ) and zhou dynasty ( 1046256 bc ) presaged the age of nomadic empire .
the concept of mongolia a an independent power north of china is expressed in a letter sent by emperor wen of han to laoshang chanyu in 162 bc ( recorded in the hanshu ) :
since prehistoric time , mongolia ha been inhabited by nomad who , from time to time , formed great confederation that rose to power and prominence . common institution were the office of the khan ( title ) , the kurultai ( supreme council ) , left and right wing , imperial army ( keshig ) and the decimal military system . the first of these empire , the xiongnu of undetermined ethnicity , were brought together by modu shanyu to form a confederation in 209 bc . soon they emerged a the greatest threat to the qin dynasty , forcing the latter to construct the great wall of china . it wa guarded by up to almost 300,000 soldier during marshal meng tian 's tenure , a a mean of defense against the destructive xiongnu raid . the vast xiongnu empire ( 209 bc93 ad ) wa followed by the mongolic xianbei state ( 93234 ad ) , which also ruled more than the entirety of present-day mongolia . the mongolic rouran khaganate ( 330555 ) , of xianbei provenance wa the first to use `` khagan '' a an imperial title . it ruled a massive empire before being defeated by the gktrks ( 555745 ) whose empire wa even bigger .
the gktrks laid siege to panticapaeum , present-day kerch , in 576 . they were succeeded by the uyghur khaganate ( 745840 ) who were defeated by the kyrgyz . the mongolic khitan people , descendant of the xianbei , ruled mongolia during the liao dynasty ( 9071125 ) , after which the khamag mongol ( 11251206 ) rose to prominence .
line 35 of the memorial inscription of bilge khagan ( 684737 ) in central mongolia summarizes the time of the khagans :
<section_title_start> middle age to early 20th century <section_title_end>
in the chaos of the late 12th century , a chieftain named genghis khan finally succeeded in uniting the mongol tribe between manchuria and the altai mountain . in 1206 , he took the title genghis khan # name and title , and waged a series of military campaign  renowned for their brutality and ferocity  sweeping through much of asia , and forming the mongol empire , the largest contiguous land empire in world history . under his successor it stretched from present-day poland in the west to korea in the east , and from part of siberia in the north to the gulf of oman and vietnam in the south , covering some , ( 22 % of earth 's total land area ) and had a population of over 100 million people ( about a quarter of earth 's total population at the time ) . the emergence of pax mongolica also significantly eased trade and commerce across asia during it height .
after genghis khan 's death , the empire wa subdivided into four kingdom or khanate . these eventually became quasi-independent after the toluid civil war ( 12601264 ) , which broke out in a battle for power following mngke khan 's death in 1259 . one of the khanate , the `` great khaanate '' , consisting of the mongol homeland and history of china , became known a the yuan dynasty under kublai khan , the grandson of genghis khan . he set up his capital in present-day beijing . after more than a century of power , the yuan wa replaced by the ming dynasty in 1368 , and the mongol court fled to the north . a the ming army pursued the mongol into their homeland , they successfully sacked and destroyed the mongol capital karakorum and other city . some of these attack were repelled by the mongol under biligt khan ayushiridara and his general kke temr .
after the expulsion of the yuan dynasty ruler from china , the mongol continued to rule their homeland , known a the northern yuan dynasty . the next century were marked by violent power struggle among various faction , notably the genghisids and the non-genghisid oirats , a well a by several chinese invasion ( such a the yongle emperor 's campaign against the mongol ) . in the early 15th century , the oirads under esen tayisi gained the upper hand , and raided china in 1449 in a tumu crisis over esen 's right to pay tribute , capturing the ming zhengtong emperor in the process . when esen wa murdered in 1454 , the borjigids regained power .
in the early 16th century , dayan khan and his khatun mandukhai reunited the entire mongol nation under the genghisids . in the mid-16th century , altan khan of the tmed , a grandson of dayan khan  but not a hereditary or legitimate khan  became powerful . he founded hohhot in 1557 . after he met with the dalai lama in 1578 , he ordered the introduction of tibetan buddhism to mongolia . ( it wa the second time this had occurred . ) abtai khan of the khalkha converted to buddhism and founded the erdene zuu monastery in 1585 . his grandson zanabazar became the first jebtsundamba khutughtu in 1640 . following the leader , the entire mongolian population embraced buddhism . each family kept scripture and buddha statue on an altar at the north side of their yurt ( yurt ) . mongolian noble donated land , money and herder to the monastery . a wa typical in state with established religion , the top religious institution , the monastery , wielded significant temporal power in addition to spiritual power .
the last mongol khan wa ligden khan in the early 17th century . he came into conflict with the manchu people over the looting of chinese city , and also alienated most mongol tribe . he died in 1634 . by 1636 most inner mongolian tribe had submitted to the manchu , who founded the qing dynasty . the khalkha eventually submitted to qing rule in 1691 , thus bringing all of today 's mongolia under manchu rule . after several war , the dzungars ( western mongol or oirats ) were virtually annihilated during the qing conquest of dzungaria in 17571758 .
some scholar estimate that about 80 % of the 600,000 or more dzungar genocide by a combination of disease and warfare . outer mongolia wa given relative autonomy , being administered by the hereditary genghisid khanate of tusheet khan , setsen khan , zasagt khan and sain noyon khan . the jebtsundamba khutuktu of mongolia had immense de facto authority . the manchu forbade mass chinese immigration into the area , which allowed the mongol to keep their culture . the oirats who migrated to the ponticcaspian steppe in russia became known a kalmyks .
the main trade route during this period wa the siberian route through siberia ; it had permanent station located every , each of which wa staffed by 530 chosen family .
until 1911 , the qing dynasty maintained control of mongolia with a series of alliance and intermarriage , a well a military and economic measure . ambans , manchu `` high official '' , were installed in ulaanbaatar , uliastai , and khovd ( city ) , and the country wa divided into numerous feudal and ecclesiastical fiefdom ( which also placed people in power with loyalty to the qing ) . over the course of the 19th century , the feudal lord attached more importance to representation and le importance to the responsibility towards their subject . the behaviour of mongolia 's nobility , together with usury practice by chinese trader and the collection of imperial tax in silver instead of animal , resulted in widespread poverty among the nomad . by 1911 there were 700 large and small monastery in outer mongolia ; their 115,000 monk made up 21 % of the population . apart from the jebtsundamba khutuktu , there were 13 other reincarnating high lama , called 'seal-holding saint ' ( tamgatai khutuktu ) , in outer mongolia .

with the fall of the qing dynasty in 1911 , mongolia under the bogd khaan declared it independence . but the newly established republic of china ( 19121949 ) considered mongolia to be part of it own territory . yuan shikai , the president of the republic of china , considered the new republic to be the successor state of the qing . bogd khaan said that qing dynasty in inner asia had been administered by the manchu people during the qing , and after the fall of the qing dynasty in 1911 , the contract of mongolian submission to the manchu had become invalid .
the area controlled by the bogd khaan wa approximately that of the former outer mongolia during the qing period . in 1919 , after the october revolution in russia , chinese troop led by warlord era xu shuzheng occupied mongolia . warfare erupted on the northern border . a a result of the russian civil war , the white movement russian lieutenant general roman ungern von sternberg led his troop into mongolia in october 1920 , defeating the chinese force in ulaanbaatar ( now ulaanbaatar ) in early february 1921 with mongol support .
to eliminate the threat posed by ungern , russian sfsr decided to support the establishment of a communist mongolian government and army . this mongolian army took the altanbulag , selenge of kyakhta from chinese force on march 18 , 1921 , and on july 6 russian and mongolian troop arrived in khree . mongolia declared it independence again on july 11 , 1921 . a a result , mongolia wa closely aligned with the soviet union over the next seven decade .
<section_title_start>  mongolian people 's republic  <section_title_end>

khorloogiin choibalsan instituted collectivization of livestock , began the destruction of the tibetan buddhism monastery , and carried out stalinist repression in mongolia , which resulted in the murder of numerous monk and other leader . in mongolia during the 1920s , approximately one-third of the male population were monk . by the beginning of the 20th century , about 750 monastery were functioning in mongolia .
in 1930 , the soviet union stopped buryats migration to the mongolian people 's republic to prevent mongolian reunification . all leader of mongolia who did not fulfill joseph stalin 's demand to perform red terror against mongolian were executed , including peljidiin genden and anandyn amar . the great purge , which began in 1937 , killed more than 30,000 people . choibalsan died suspiciously in the soviet union in 1952 . comintern leader bohumr meral said , `` people of mongolia are not important , the land is important . mongolian land is larger than england , france and germany '' .
after the japanese invasion of manchuria in 1931 , mongolia wa threatened on this front . during the battle of khalkhin gol soviet-japanese border war of 1939 , the soviet union successfully defended mongolia against japanese expansionism . mongolia fought against japan during the battle of khalkhin gol in 1939 and during the sovietjapanese war in august 1945 to liberate inner mongolia from japan and mengjiang .

after the establishment of the people 's republic of china , both country confirmed their mutual recognition on october 6 , 1949 . however , the republic of china used it united nation security council veto power in 1955 , to stop the admission of the mongolian people 's republic to the united nation on the ground it recognized all of mongolia including outer mongolia a part of china . this wa the only time the republic of china and the united nation ever used it veto . hence , and because of the repeated threat to veto by the roc , mongolia did not join the un until 1961 when the soviet union agreed to lift it veto on the admission of mauritania ( and any other newly independent african state ) , in return for the admission of mongolia . faced with pressure from nearly all the other african country , the roc relented under protest . mongolia and mauritania were both admitted to the un on 27 october 1961 .

around 125 bc , the south of gaul wa conquered by the roman , who called this region gallia narbonensis ( `` our province '' ) , which over time evolved into the name provence in french . julius caesar conquered the remainder of gaul and overcame a revolt carried out by the gallic chieftain vercingetorix in 52 bc . according to plutarch and the writing of scholar brendan wood , the gallic war resulted in 800 conquered city , 300 subdued tribe , one million men sold into slavery in ancient rome , and another three million dead in battle .
gaul wa divided by augustus into roman province . many city were founded during the roman gaul gallo-roman period , including lugdunum ( present-day lyon ) , which is considered the capital of the gaul . these city were built in traditional roman style , with a roman forum , a roman theatre ( structure ) , a roman circus , an amphitheatre and spa . the gaul mixed with roman settler and eventually adopted roman culture and romance language speech ( latin , from which the french language evolved ) . the religion in ancient rome merged with the ancient celtic religion into the same syncretism .
from the 250s to the 280s ad , roman gaul suffered a serious crisis with it lime ( roman empire ) being attacked on several occasion by barbarian . nevertheless , the situation improved in the first half of the 4th century , which wa a period of revival and prosperity for roman gaul . in 312 , emperor constantine the great converted to christianity . subsequently , christian , who had been persecuted until then , increased rapidly across the entire roman empire . but , from the beginning of the 5th century , the migration period resumed . teutonic tribe invaded the region from present-day germany , the visigoth settling in the southwest , the burgundians along the rhine river valley , and the frank ( from whom the french take their name ) in the north .
<section_title_start> early middle age ( 5th10th century )  <section_title_end>
at the end of the late antiquity period , ancient gaul wa divided into several germanic kingdom and a remaining gallo-roman territory , known a the domain of soissons . simultaneously , briton ( historical ) , fleeing the anglo-saxon settlement of britain , settled the western part of armorica . a a result , the armorican peninsula wa renamed brittany , celt wa revived and independent petty kingdom arose in this region .
the first leader to make himself king of all the frank wa clovis i , who began his reign in 481 , routing the last force of the roman governor of the province in 486 . clovis claimed that he would be baptized a christian in the event of his victory against the visigothic kingdom , which wa said to have guaranteed the battle . clovis franco-visigothic war , wa baptized in 508 , and made himself master of what is now western germany .
clovis i wa the first germanic people conqueror after the fall of the roman empire to convert to catholic christianity , rather than arianism ; thus france wa given the title `` eldest daughter of the church '' ( la fille ane de l'glise links=no ) by the papacy , and french king would be called `` the most christian king of france '' ( rex christianissimus ) .
the frank embraced the christian gallo-roman culture and ancient gaul wa eventually renamed francia ( `` land of the frank '' ) . the germanic frank adopted romance language , except in northern gaul where roman settlement were le dense and where germanic language emerged . clovis made paris his capital and established the merovingian dynasty , but his kingdom would not survive his death . the frank treated land purely a a private possession and divided it among their heir , so four kingdom emerged from clovis 's : paris , orlans , soissons , and reims . the roi fainant power behind the throne to their mayor of the palace ( head of household ) . one mayor of the palace , charles martel , defeated an islamic invasion of gaul at the battle of tour ( 732 ) and earned respect and power within the frankish kingdom . his son , pepin the short , seized the crown of francia from the weakened merovingian and founded the carolingian dynasty . pepin 's son , charlemagne , reunited the frankish kingdom and built a vast empire across western europe and central europe .
proclaimed holy roman emperor by pope leo iii and thus establishing in earnest the french government 's longtime history of roman catholicism in france with the catholic church , charlemagne tried to revive the western roman empire and it cultural grandeur . charlemagne 's son , louis the pious ( emperor 814840 ) , kept the empire united ; however , this carolingian empire would not survive his death . in 843 , under the treaty of verdun , the empire wa divided between louis ' three son , with east francia going to louis the german , middle francia to lothair i , and west francia to charles the bald . west francia approximated the area occupied by , and wa the precursor to , modern france .
during the 9th and 10th century , continually threatened by viking expansion , france became a very decentralized state : the nobility 's title and land became hereditary , and the authority of the king became more religious than secular and thus wa le effective and constantly challenged by powerful nobleman . thus wa established feudalism in france . over time , some of the king 's vassal would grow so powerful that they often posed a threat to the king . for example , after the battle of hastings in 1066 , william the conqueror added `` king of england '' to his title , becoming both the vassal to ( a duke of normandy ) and the equal of ( a king of england ) the king of france , creating recurring tension .
<section_title_start> high and late middle age ( 10th15th century )  <section_title_end>
the carolingian dynasty ruled france until 987 , when hugh capet , duke of france and count of paris , wa crowned list of french monarch . his descendantsthe house of capet , the house of valois and the house of bourbonprogressively unified the country through war and dynastic inheritance into the kingdom of france , which wa fully declared in 1190 by philip ii of france ( philippe auguste ) . later king would expand their directly possessed crown land of france to cover over half of modern continental france by the 15th century , including most of the north , centre and west of france . during this process , the royal authority became more and more assertive , centered on a estate of the realm distinguishing french nobility , clergy , and estate general ( france ) .
the french nobility played a prominent role in most crusade to restore christian access to the holy land . french knight made up the bulk of the steady flow of reinforcement throughout the two-hundred-year span of the crusade , in such a fashion that the arab uniformly referred to the crusader a franj caring little whether they really came from france . the french crusader also imported the french language into the levant , making old french the base of the lingua franca ( litt . `` frankish language '' ) of the crusader state . french knight also made up the majority in both the knight hospitaller and the knight templar . the latter , in particular , held numerous property throughout france and by the 13th century were the principal banker for the french crown , until philip iv of france annihilated the order in 1307 . the albigensian crusade wa launched in 1209 to eliminate the heretical catharism in the southwestern area of modern-day france . in the end , the cathars were exterminated and the autonomous count of toulouse wa annexed into the crown land of france .
from the 11th century , the house of plantagenet , the ruler of the county of anjou , succeeded in establishing it dominion over the surrounding province of maine ( province ) and touraine , then progressively built an `` empire '' that spanned from england to the pyrenees and covering half of modern france . tension between the kingdom of france and the angevin empire would last a hundred year , until philip ii of france conquered , between 1202 and 1214 most of the continental possession of the empire , leaving england and aquitaine to the plantagenet . following the battle of bouvines , the angevin court retreated to england , but persistent capetianplantagenet rivalry would pave the way for another conflict , the hundred year ' war .
charles iv of france died without an heir in 1328 . under the rule of the salic law the crown of france could not pas to a woman nor could the line of kingship pas through the female line . accordingly , the crown passed to philip of valois , a cousin of charles , rather than through the female line to charles ' nephew , edward of plantagenet , who would soon become edward iii of england . during the reign of philip iv of france , the french monarchy reached the height of it medieval power . philip 's seat on the throne wa contested by edward iii of england in 1337 , on the eve of the first wave of the black death , and england and france went to war in what would become known a the hundred year ' war . the exact boundary changed greatly with time , but french landholding of the list of english monarch remained extensive for decade . with charismatic leader , such a joan of arc and la hire , strong french counterattack won back most english continental territory . like the rest of europe , france wa struck by the black death ; half of the 17 ; million population of france died .

the french renaissance saw a spectacular cultural development and the first standardisation of the french language , which would become the ordinance of villers-cotterts and the language of europe 's aristocracy . it also saw a long set of war , known a the italian war , between france and the house of habsburg . french explorer , such a jacques cartier or samuel de champlain , claimed land in the america for france , paving the way for the expansion of the french colonial empire . the rise of protestantism in europe led france to a civil war known a the french war of religion , where , in the most notorious incident , thousand of huguenot were murdered in the st. bartholomew 's day massacre of 1572 . the war of religion were ended by henry iv of france 's edict of nantes , which granted some freedom of religion to the huguenot . habsburg spain troop , the terror of western europe , assisted the catholic side during the war of religion in 15891594 , and invaded northern france in 1597 ; after some skirmishing in the 1620s and 1630s , spain and france returned to all-out war between 1635 and 1659 . franco-spanish war ( 16351659 ) cost france 300,000 casualty .
under louis xiii , the energetic cardinal richelieu promoted the centralisation of the state and reinforced the royal power by disarming domestic power holder in the 1620s . he systematically destroyed castle of defiant lord and denounced the use of private violence ( dueling , carrying weapon and maintaining private army ) . by the end of the 1620s , richelieu established `` the royal monopoly of force '' a the doctrine . during louis xiv 's minority and the regency of anne of austria and cardinal mazarin , a period of trouble known a the fronde occurred in france . this rebellion wa driven by the great feudal lord and sovereign court a a reaction to the absolutism ( european history ) in france .
the monarchy reached it peak during the 17th century and the reign of louis xiv . by turning powerful feudal lord into courtier at the palace of versailles , louis xiv 's personal power became unchallenged . remembered for his numerous war , he made france the leading european power . france became the demographic of france and had tremendous influence over european politics , economy , and culture . french became the most-used language in diplomacy , science , literature and international affair , and remained so until the 20th century . france obtained many overseas possession in the america , africa and asia . louis xiv also edict of fontainebleau , forcing thousand of huguenot into exile .
under louis xv , louis xiv 's great-grandson , france lost new france and most of it french india after it defeat in the seven year ' war ( 17561763 ) . it metropolitan france kept growing , however , with notable acquisition such a lorraine ( 1766 ) and corsica ( 1770 ) . an unpopular king , louis xv 's weak rule , his ill-advised financial , political and military decision a well a the debauchery of his court discredited the monarchy , which arguably paved the way for the french revolution 15 year after his death .
louis xvi , louis xv 's grandson , actively france in the american revolutionary war , who were seeking their american revolutionary war ( realised in the treaty of paris ( 1783 ) ) . the financial crisis aggravated by france 's involvement in the american revolutionary war wa one of many contributing factor to the french revolution . much of the age of enlightenment occurred in french intellectual circle , and major scientific breakthrough and invention , such a the antoine lavoisier ( 1778 ) and the first montgolfier brother ( 1783 ) , were achieved by french scientist . french explorer , such a louis antoine de bougainville and jean-franois de galaup , comte de laprouse , took part in the european and american voyage of scientific exploration through maritime expedition around the globe . the enlightenment philosophy , in which rationalism is advocated a the primary source for legitimacy ( political ) and authority , undermined the power of and support for the monarchy and helped pave the way for the french revolution .
<section_title_start> revolutionary france ( 17891799 )  <section_title_end>
facing financial trouble , king louis xvi of france summoned the estates-general of 1789 estates-general ( gathering the three estate of the realm ) in may 1789 to propose solution to his government . a it came to an impasse , the representative of the commoner formed into a national assembly ( french revolution ) , signalling the outbreak of the french revolution . fearing that the king would suppress the newly created national assembly , insurgent storming of the bastille on 14 july 1789 , a date which would become bastille day france 's national day .
in early august 1789 , the national constituent assembly ( france ) august decree of the french nobility such a serfdom and exclusive hunting right . through the declaration of the right of the man and of the citizen of 1789 ( 27 august 1789 ) france established fundamental right for men . the declaration affirms `` the natural and imprescriptible right of man '' to `` liberty , property , security and resistance to oppression '' . freedom of speech and press were declared , and arbitrary arrest outlawed . it called for the destruction of aristocratic privilege and proclaimed freedom and equal right for all men , a well a access to public office based on talent rather than birth . in november 1789 , the assembly decided to nationalise and sell all property of the catholic church which had been the largest landowner in the country . in july 1790 , a civil constitution of the clergy reorganized the french catholic church , cancelling the authority of the church to levy tax , et cetera . this fueled much discontent in part of france , which would contribute to the civil war breaking out some year later . while king louis xvi still enjoyed popularity among the population , his disastrous flight to varennes ( june 1791 ) seemed to justify rumor he had tied his hope of political salvation to the prospect of foreign invasion . his credibility wa so deeply undermined that the abolition of monarchy and establishment of a republic became an increasing possibility .
in august 1791 , the emperor of habsburg monarchy and the king of kingdom of prussia in the declaration of pillnitz threatened revolutionary france to intervene by force of arm to restore the french absolute monarchy . in september 1791 , the national constituent assembly forced king louis xvi to accept the french constitution of 1791 , thus turning the french absolute monarchy into a kingdom of france ( 179192 ) . in the newly established legislative assembly ( france ) ( october 1791 ) , enmity developed and deepened between a group , later called the 'girondins ' , who favored war with habsburg monarchy and kingdom of prussia , and a group later called 'the mountain ' or 'jacobins ' , who opposed such a war . a majority in the legislative assembly ( france ) in 1792 however saw a war with austria and prussia a a chance to boost the popularity of the revolutionary government , and thought that france would win a war against those gathered monarchy . on 20 april 1792 , therefore , they french revolutionary war .
on 10 august 1792 , an angry crowd insurrection of 10 august 1792 , who took refuge in the legislative assembly . a prussian army invaded france later in august 1792 . in early september , parisian , infuriated by french revolutionary war and counter-revolutionary uprising in the west of france , september massacre murdered between 1,000 and 1,500 prisoner by raiding the parisian prison . the legislative assembly ( france ) and the paris commune ( french revolution ) seemed unable to stop that bloodshed . the national convention , chosen in the first election under male universal suffrage , on 20 september 1792 succeeded the legislative assembly ( france ) and on 21 september abolished the monarchy by proclaiming the french first republic .
ex-king louis xvi wa trial of louis xvi of treason and execution of louis xvi .
france had declared war on great britain and the dutch republic in november 1792 and did the same on spain in march 1793 ; in the spring of 1793 , austria and prussia invaded france ; in march , france created a `` sister republic '' in the `` republic of mainz '' .
also in march 1793 , the war in the vende started , evoked by both the civil constitution of the clergy of 1790 and the nationwide army conscription early 1793 ; elsewhere in france rebellion wa brewing too . a factionalist feud in the national convention , smoldering ever since october 1791 , came to a climax with the group of the 'girondins ' on 2 june 1793 being forced to resign and leave the convention . the counter-revolution , begun in march 1793 in the vende , by july had spread to brittany ( administrative region ) , normandy , bordeaux , marseille , toulon , and lyon . paris ' convention government between october and december 1793 with brutal measure managed to subdue most internal uprising , at the cost of ten of thousand of life . some historian consider the civil war to have lasted until 1796 with a toll of possibly 450,000 life . by the end of 1793 the ally had been driven from france . france in february 1794 abolitionism in it french colonial empire , but would reintroduce it later .
political disagreement and enmity in the national convention between october 1793 and july 1794 reached unprecedented level , leading to dozen of convention member being sentenced to death and guillotined . meanwhile , french revolutionary war france 's external war in 1794 were going prosperous , for example in belgium . in 1795 , the government seemed to return to indifference towards the desire and need of the lower class concerning freedom of ( catholic church ) religion and fair distribution of food . until 1799 , politician , apart from inventing a new parliamentary system ( the 'french directory ' ) , busied themselves with dissuading the people from catholic church and from royalism .

france wa a member of the triple entente when world war i broke out . a small part of northern france wa occupied , but france and it ally emerged victorious against the central power at a tremendous human and material cost . world war i left 1.4 ; million french soldier dead , 4 % of it population . between 27 and 30 % of soldier conscripted from 1912 to 1915 were killed . the interbellum year were marked by event preceding world war ii in europe and a variety of social reform introduced by the popular front ( france ) ( annual leave , eight-hour day eight-hour workday , woman in government ) .
in 1940 , france wa battle of france and occupied by nazi germany and kingdom of italy . metropolitan france wa divided into a german military administration in occupied france during world war ii in the north , an italian occupation of france in the southeast and vichy france , a newly established authoritarian regime collaborating with germany , in the south , while free france , the government-in-exile led by charles de gaulle , wa set up in london . from 1942 to 1944 , about 160,000 french citizen , including around the holocaust in france 75,000 jew , were deported to extermination camp and concentration camp in germany and occupied poland . in september 1943 , corsica wa the first french metropolitan territory to liberate itself from the axis . on 6 june 1944 , the ally of world war ii invasion of normandy and in august they operation dragoon . over the following year the ally and the french resistance emerged victorious over the axis power and french sovereignty wa restored with the establishment of the provisional government of the french republic ( gprf ) . this interim government , established by de gaulle , aimed to continue to western allied invasion of germany and to puration lgale . it also made several important reform ( suffrage extended to woman , creation of a social security in france system ) .

in 1958 , the weak and unstable fourth republic gave way to the french fifth republic , which included a strengthened presidency . in the latter role , charles de gaulle managed to keep the country together while taking step to end the algerian war . the war wa concluded with the vian accord in 1962 that led to algerian independence . the algerian independence came at a high price ; the large toll on the algerian population . it resulted in half million to a million death and over 2 ; million internally displaced algerian . a vestige of the colonial empire are the overseas france .
in the context of the cold war , de gaulle pursued a policy of `` national independence '' towards the western bloc and eastern bloc . to this end , he withdrew from nato 's military integrated command ( while remaining in the nato alliance itself ) , launched a force de dissuasion and made france the france and weapon of mass destruction . he lyse treaty cordial francegermany relation franco-german relation to create a european counterweight between the american and soviet sphere of influence . however , he opposed any development of a supranational union , favouring a europe of sovereign state . in the wake of the series of worldwide protest of 1968 , the may 1968 in france had an enormous social impact . in france , it is considered to be the watershed moment when a conservative moral ideal ( religion , patriotism , respect for authority ) shifted towards a more liberal moral ideal ( secularism , individualism , sexual revolution ) . although the revolt wa a political failure ( a the gaullism party emerged even stronger than before ) it announced a split between the french people and de gaulle who resigned shortly after .
in the post-gaullist era , france remained one of the most developed list of country by gdp ( nominal ) , but faced several economic crisis that resulted in high unemployment rate and increasing public debt . in the late 20th and early 21st century france ha been at the forefront of the development of a supranational european union , notably by signing the maastricht treaty ( which created the european union ) in 1992 , establishing the eurozone in 1999 and signing the treaty of lisbon in 2007 . france ha also gradually but fully reintegrated into nato and ha since participated in most nato sponsored war .

<section_title_start>  etymology  <section_title_end>
the word portugal derives from the ancient rome-celts place name portus cale ; a city where present-day vila nova de gaia now stand , at the mouth of the river douro in the north of what is now portugal . the name of the city is from the latin word for port or harbour , portus , but the second element of portus cale is le clear . the mainstream explanation for the name is that it is an ethnonym derived from the castro culture , also known a the callaeci , gallaeci or gallaecia , who occupied the north-west of the iberian peninsula . the name cale and callaici are the origin of today 's vila nova de gaia and galicia ( spain ) .
another theory proposes that cale or calle is a derivation of the celtic word for port , like the irish language caladh or scottish gaelic cala . these explanation , would require the pre-roman language of the area to have been a branch of q-celtic , which is not generally accepted because the region 's pre-roman language wa gallaecian celtic , usually considered p-celtic . however , scholar like jean markale and tranoy propose that the celtic branch all share the same origin , and placenames such a cale , gal , gaia , calais , galatia , galicia , gaelic , gael , gaul , wale , cornwall , wallonia and others all stem from one linguistic root .
another theory ha it that cala wa the name of a celtic goddess ( drawing a comparison with the gaelic language cailleach , a supernatural hag ) . some french scholar believe the name may have come from `` portus gallus '' , the port of the gaul or celt .
around 200 bc , the roman took the iberian peninsula from the ancient carthage during the second punic war . in the process they conquered cale , renaming it portus cale ( `` port of cale '' ) and incorporating it in the province of gaelicia with it capital in bracara augusta ( modern day braga , portugal ) . during the middle age , the region around portus cale became known by the suebi and visigoth a portucale . the name portucale evolved into portugale during the 7th and 8th century , and by the 9th century , that term wa used extensively to refer to the region between the river douro and minho river . by the 11th and 12th century , portugale , portugallia , portvgallo or portvgalliae wa already referred to a portugal .
the 14th century middle french name for the country , portingal , which added an intrusive /n/ sound through the process of excrescence ( phonology ) , spread to middle english . middle english variant spelling included portingall , portingale , portyngale and portingaill . the spelling portyngale is found in chaucer 's epilogue to the nun 's priest 's tale . these variant survive in the torrent of portyngale , a middle english romance composed around 1400 , and `` old robin of portingale '' , an english child ballad . portingal and variant were also used in scot language and survive in the cornish language name for the country , : kw : portyngal .

<section_title_start>  prehistory  <section_title_end>
the early history of portugal is shared with the rest of the iberian peninsula located in southwestern europe . the name of portugal derives from the joined romano-celtic name portus cale . the region wa pre-roman people of the iberian peninsula by pre-celts and celt , giving origin to people like the gallaeci , lusitanians , celtici and cynetes ( also known a conii ) , visited by phoenicians-carthaginians and ancient greek , wa incorporated in the roman republic dominion a lusitania and part of gallaecia , after 45 bc until 298 ad .
the region of present-day portugal wa inhabited by neanderthal and then by homo sapiens , who roamed the border-less region of the northern iberian peninsula . these were subsistence society and although they did not establish prosperous settlement , they did form organized society . neolithic portugal experimented with domestication of herding animal , the raising of some cereal crop and fluvial or marine fishing .
it is believed by some scholar that early in the first millennium bc , several wave of celt invaded portugal from central europe and inter-married with the local population , forming pre-roman people of the iberian peninsula.another theory suggests that celt inhabited western iberia / portugal well before any large celtic migration from central europe . in addition , a number of linguist expert in ancient celtic have presented compelling evidence that the tartessian language , once spoken in part of sw spain and sw portugal , is at least proto-celtic in structure .
modern archaeology and research show a portuguese root to the celt in portugal and elsewhere . during that period and until the roman invasion , the castro culture ( a variation of the urnfield culture also known a urnenfelderkultur ) wa prolific in portugal and modern galicia .
this culture , together with the surviving element of the atlantic megalithic culture and the contribution that come from the more western mediterranean culture , ended up in what ha been called the cultura castreja or castro culture . this designation refers to the characteristic celtic population called 'dn ' , 'din ' or 'don ' in goidelic language and that the roman called castrae in their chronicle .
based on the roman chronicle about the callaeci people , along with the lebor gabla renn narration and the interpretation of the abundant archaeological remains throughout the northern half of portugal and galicia , it is possible to infer that there wa a matriarchal society , with a military and religious aristocracy probably of the feudal type . the figure of maximum authority were the chieftain ( chefe tribal ) , of military type and with authority in his castro or clan , and the druid , mainly referring to medical and religious function that could be common to several castro . the celtic cosmogony remained homogeneous due to the ability of the druid to meet in council with the druid of other area , which ensured the transmission of knowledge and the most significant event .
the first documentary reference to castro society are provided by chronicler of roman military campaign such a strabo , herodotus and pliny the elder among others , about the social organization , and describing the inhabitant of these territory , the gallaecia a :
`` a group of barbarian who spend the day fighting and the night eating , drinking and dancing under the moon . ''
there were other similar tribe , and chief among them were the lusitanians ; the core area of these people lay in inland central portugal , while numerous other related tribe existed such a the celtici , and the cynetes . among the tribe or sub-divisions were the bracari , coelerni , equaesi , grovii , interamici , leuni , luanqui , limici , narbasi , nemetati , paesuri , quaquerni , seurbi , tamagani , tapoli , turduli , turduli veteres , turdulorum oppida , turodi , and zoelae . a few small , semi-permanent , commercial coastal settlement ( such a tavira municipality ) were also founded in the algarve region by phoenicianscarthaginians .
<section_title_start>  roman lusitania and gallaecia  <section_title_end>
roman first invaded the iberian peninsula in 219 bc . the carthaginian , rome 's adversary in the punic war , were expelled from their coastal colony . during the last day of julius caesar , almost the entire peninsula wa annexed to the roman republic .
the roman conquest of what is now part of portugal took almost two hundred year and took many life of young soldier and
the life of those who were sentenced to a certain death in the slave mine when not sold a slave to other part of the empire . it suffered a severe setback in 155 bc , when a lusitanian war began in the north . the lusitanians and other native tribe , under the leadership of viriathus , wrested control of all of western iberia .
rome sent numerous legion and it best general to lusitania to quell the rebellion , but to no avail  the lusitanians kept conquering territory . the roman leader decided to change their strategy . they bribed viriathus 's ally to kill him . in 139 bc , viriathus wa assassinated and tautalus became leader of the lusitanians .
rome installed a colonial regime . the complete romanization of lusitania only took place in the visigothic era .
in 27 bc , lusitania gained the status of roman province . later , a northern province of lusitania wa formed , known a gallaecia , with capital in bracara augusta , today 's braga .
there are still many ruin of castro ( [ fort ] ) throughout modern portugal and remains of the castro culture .
some urban remains are quite large , like conmbriga and mirbriga . the former , beyond being one of the largest roman empire settlement in portugal , is also classified a a monument of portugal . conmbriga lie from coimbra , which in turn wa the ancient aeminium . the site also ha a museum that display object found by archaeologist during their excavation .
several work of engineering , such a bath , temple , bridge , road , circus , theatre and layman 's home are preserved throughout the country . coin , some coined in lusitanian land , a well a numerous piece of ceramic , were also found . contemporary historian include paulus orosius ( c. 375418 ) and hydatius ( c. 400469 ) , bishop of aqua flaviae , who reported on the final year of the roman rule and arrival of the germanic people .
<section_title_start>  germanic kingdom : suebi and visigoth  <section_title_end>
in the early 5th century , germanic people , namely the suebi and the vandal ( silingi and hasdingi ) together with their ally , the sarmatians and alans invaded the iberian peninsula where they would form their kingdom . the kingdom of the suebi wa the germanic post-roman kingdom , established in the former roman province of gallaecia-lusitania . 5th-century vestige of alans settlement were found in alenquer municipality , portugal ( from old germanic alan kerk , temple of the alans ) , coimbra and lisbon .
about 410 and during the 6th century it became a formally declared kingdom of the suebi , where king hermeric made a peace treaty with the gallaecians before passing his domain to rechila , his son . in 448 rechila died , leaving the state in expansion to rechiar .
after the defeat against the visigoth , the suebian kingdom wa divided , with frantan and aguiulfo ruling simultaneously . both reigned from 456 to 457 , the year in which maldras ( 457459 ) reunified the kingdom . he wa assassinated after a failed roman-visigothic conspiracy .
although the conspiracy did not achieve it true purpose , the suebian kingdom wa again divided between two king :
frumar ( frumario 459463 ) and remismund ( remismundo , son of maldras ) ( 459469 ) who would re-reunify his father 's kingdom in 463 . he would be forced to adopt arianism in 465 due to the visigoth influence .
by the year 500 , the visigothic kingdom had been installed in iberia , it wa based in toledo , spain and advancing westward . they became a threat to the suebian rule .
after the death of remismund in 469 a dark period set in , where virtually all written text and account disappear . this period lasted until 550 . the only thing known about this period is that theodemund ( teodemundo ) most probably ruled the suebians .
the dark period ended with the reign of karriarico ( 550559 ) who reinstalled catholic church in 550 . he wa succeeded by theodemir ( suebian king ) ( 559570 ) during whose reign the 1st council of braga ( 561 ) wa held .
the council represented an advance in the organization of the territory ( paroeciam suevorum ( suebian parish ) and the christianization of the pagan population ( de correctione rusticorum ) under the auspex of saint martin of braga ( so martinho de braga ) .
after the death of teodomiro , miro ( suebian king ) ( 570583 ) wa his successor . during his reign , the 2nd council of braga ( 572 ) wa held .
the visigothic civil war began in 577 . miro intervened . later in 583 he also organized an unsuccessful expedition to reconquer seville . during the return from this failed operation miro died .
in the suebian kingdom many internal struggle continued to take place . eborico ( eurico , 583584 ) wa dethroned by andeca ( audeca 584585 ) , who failed to prevent the visigothic invasion led by leovigildo . the visigothic invasion , completed in 585 , turned the once rich and fertile kingdom of the suebi into the sixth province of the gothic kingdom .
leovigild wa crowned king of gallaecia , hispania and gallia narbonensis .
for the next 300 year and by the year 700 , the entire iberian peninsula wa ruled by the visigoth . under the visigoth , gallaecia wa a well-defined space governed by a doge of it own . doge at this time were related to the monarchy acted a prince in all matter . both 'governors ' wamba ( king ) and wittiza ( vitiza ) acted a doge ( they would later become king in toledo ) . these two became known a the 'vitizians ' , who headquartered in the northwest and called on the arab invader from the south to be their ally in the struggle for power in 711 . king roderic ( rodrigo ) wa killed while opposing this invasion , thus becoming the last visigothic king of iberia . from the various germanic group who settled in western iberia , the suebi left the strongest lasting cultural legacy in what is today portugal , galicia and western fringe of asturias .
according to dan stanislawski , the portuguese way of living in region north of the tagus is mostly inherited from the suebi , in which small farm prevail , distinct from the large property of southern portugal .
bracara augusta , the modern city of braga and former capital of gallaecia , became the capital of the suebi . apart from cultural and some linguistic trace , the suebians left the highest germanic genetic contribution of the iberian peninsula in portugal and galicia . paulus orosius , at that time resident in hispania , show a rather pacific initial settlement , the newcomer working their land or serving a bodyguard of the local .
another germanic group that accompanied the suebi and settled in gallaecia were the buri ( germanic tribe ) . they settled in the region between the river cvado river and homem , in the area known a terras de bouro ( land of the buri ) .
<section_title_start>  islamic period and the reconquista  <section_title_end>
today 's continental portugal , along with most of modern spain , wa part of al-andalus between 726 and 1249 , following the umayyad caliphate conquest of the iberian peninsula . this rule lasted from some decade in the north to five century in the south .
after defeating the visigoth in only a few month , the umayyad caliphate started expanding rapidly in the peninsula . beginning in 726 , the land that is now portugal became part of the vast umayyad caliphate 's empire of damascus , which stretched from the indus river in the indian sub-continent up to the south of france , until it collapse in 750 . that year the west of the empire gained it independence under abd-ar-rahman i with the establishment of the emirate of crdoba . after almost two century , the emirate became the caliphate of crdoba in 929 , until it dissolution a century later in 1031 into no le than 23 small kingdom , called taifa kingdom .
the governor of the taifas each proclaimed themselves emir of their province and established diplomatic relation with the christian kingdom of the north . most of present-day portugal fell into the hand of the taifa of badajoz of the aftasid dynasty , and after a short spell of an ephemeral taifa of lisbon in 1022 , fell under the dominion of the taifa of seville of the abbadids poet . the taifa period ended with the conquest of the almoravid who came from morocco in 1086 winning a decisive victory at the battle of sagrajas , followed a century later in 1147 , after the second period of taifa , by the almohads , also from marrakesh .
al-andaluz wa divided into different district called kura . gharb al-andalus at it largest wa constituted of ten kura , each with a distinct capital and governor . the main city of the period in portugal were in the southern half of the country : beja ( portugal ) , silves municipality , portugal , alccer do sal , santarm , portugal and lisbon .
the muslim population of the region consisted mainly of native iberian convert to islam ( the so-called muwallad or muladi ) and berber . the arab were principally nobleman from syria and oman ; and though few in number , they constituted the elite of the population . the berber were originally from the rif and atlas mountain region of north africa and were nomad .
<section_title_start>  county of portugal  <section_title_end>
an asturian visigothic noble named pelagius of asturias in 718 wa elected leader by many of the ousted visigoth noble . pelagius called for the remnant of the christian visigothic army to rebel against the moor and regroup in the unconquered northern asturian highland , better known today a the cantabrian mountain , in what is today the small mountain region in north-western spain , adjacent to the bay of biscay .
pelagius ' plan wa to use the cantabrian mountain a a place of refuge and protection from the invading moor . he then aimed to regroup the iberian peninsula 's christian army and use the cantabrian mountain a a springboard from which to regain their land . in the process , after defeating the moor in the battle of covadonga in 722 , pelagius wa proclaimed king , thus founding the christian kingdom of asturias and starting the war of christian reconquest known in portuguese language a the reconquista .
at the end of the 9th century , the region of portugal , between the river minho and douro , wa reconquered from the moor by the nobleman and knight vmara peres on the order of king alfonso iii of asturias . finding that the region had previously had two major city  portus cale in the coast and braga in the interior , with many town that were now deserted  he decided to repopulate and rebuild them with portuguese and galician refugee and other christian .
apart from the arab from the south , the coastal region in the north were also attacked by norman and viking raider mainly from 844 . the last great invasion , through the minho ( river ) , ended with the defeat of olaf ii haraldsson in 1014 against the galician nobility who also stopped further advance into the county of portugal .
count vmara peres organized the region he had reconquered , and elevated it to the status of county , naming it the county of portugal after the region 's major port city  portus cale or modern porto . one of the first city vimara peres founded at this time is vimaranes , known today a guimares  the `` birthplace of the portuguese nation '' or the `` cradle city '' ( cidade bero in portuguese ) .
after annexing the county of portugal into one of the several county that made up the kingdom of asturias , king alfonso iii of asturias knighted vmara peres , in 868 , a the first count of portus cale ( portugal ) . the region became known a portucale , portugale , and simultaneously portuglia  the county of portugal .
later the kingdom of asturias wa divided into a number of christian kingdom in northern iberia due to dynastic division of inheritance among the king 's offspring . with the forced abdication of alfonso iii of asturias alfonso iii `` the great '' of asturias by his son in 910 , the kingdom of asturias split into three separate kingdom . the three kingdom were eventually reunited in 924 under the crown of kingdom of len .
in 1093 , alfonso vi of len bestowed the county to henry , count of portugal and married him to his illegitimate daughter , teresa of len , countess of portugal , for his role in reconquering the land from moor . henry based his newly formed county in bracara augusta ( modern braga ) , capital city of the ancient roman province , and also previous capital of several kingdom over the first millennium .
<section_title_start> afonsine era <section_title_end>
on 24 june 1128 , the battle of so mamede occurred near guimares . afonso i of portugal , count of portugal , defeated his mother teresa , countess of portugal and her lover ferno peres de trava , thereby establishing himself a sole leader . afonso then turned his arm against the moor in the south .
afonso 's campaign were successful and , on 25 july 1139 , he obtained an overwhelming victory in the battle of ourique , and straight after wa unanimously proclaimed king of portugal by his soldier . this is traditionally taken a the occasion when the county of portugal , a a fief of the kingdom of len , wa transformed into the independent kingdom of portugal .
afonso then established the first of the portuguese cortes at lamego , where he wa crowned by the archbishop of braga , though the validity of the cortes of lamego ha been disputed and called a myth created during the portuguese restoration war . afonso wa recognized in 1143 by king alfonso vii of len , and in 1179 by pope alexander iii .
during the reconquista period , christian reconquered the iberian peninsula from moor domination . afonso henriques and his successor , aided by military christian monasticism , pushed southward to drive out the moor . at this time , portugal covered about half of it present area . in 1249 , the reconquista ended with the capture of the algarve and complete expulsion of the last moorish settlement on the southern coast , giving portugal it present-day border , with minor exception .
in one of these situation of conflict with the kingdom of castile , dinis i of portugal signed with the king fernando iv of castile ( who wa represented , when a minor , by his mother the queen maria de molina ) the treaty of alcaices ( 1297 ) , which stipulated that portugal abolished agreed treaty against the kingdom of castile for supporting the infant juan de castilla . this treaty established among other thing the border demarcation between the kingdom of portugal and the kingdom of leon , where the disputed town of olivenza wa included .
the reign of denis i of portugal ( denis i ) , afonso iv of portugal ( alphons iv ) , and peter i of portugal ( peter i ) for the most part saw peace with the christian kingdom of iberia .
in 1348 and 1349 portugal , like the rest of europe , wa devastated by the black death . in 1373 , portugal made an anglo-portuguese alliance , which is the longest-standing alliance in the world . over time , this went far beyond geo-political and military cooperation ( protecting both nation ' interest in africa , the america and asia against french , spanish and dutch rival ) and maintained strong trade and cultural tie between the two old european ally . in the oporto region , in particular , there is visible english influence to this day .
<section_title_start>  joanine era and age of discovery  <section_title_end>
in 1383 , john i of castile , husband of beatrice of portugal and son-in-law of ferdinand i of portugal , claimed the throne of portugal . a faction of petty nobleman and commoner , led by john i of portugal ( later king john i of portugal ) and commanded by general nuno lvares pereira defeated the castilian in the battle of aljubarrota . with this battle , the house of aviz became the ruling house of portugal .
portugal spearheaded european exploration of the world and the age of discovery . prince henry the navigator , son of king john i of portugal , became the main sponsor and patron of this endeavour . during this period , portugal explored the atlantic ocean , discovering the atlantic archipelago the azores , madeira , and portuguese cape verde ; explored the african coast ; colonized selected area of africa ; discovered an eastern portuguese india armada via the cape of good hope ; colonial brazil # discovery and early exploitation , explored the indian ocean , established trading route throughout most of southern asia ; and sent the first direct european maritime trade and diplomatic mission to jorge lvares and nanban trade .
in 1415 , portugal acquired the first of it overseas colony by conquering ceuta , the first prosperous islamic trade centre in north africa . there followed the first discovery in the atlantic : madeira and the azores , which led to the first colonialism movement .
throughout the 15th century , european exploration of africa # portuguese sailed the coast of africa , establishing trading post for economic history of portugal # expansion of the portuguese empire ( 15th and 16th century ) , ranging from gold to slavery , a they looked for a route to india and it spice , which were coveted in europe .
the treaty of tordesillas , intended to resolve the dispute that had been created following the return of christopher columbus , wa made by pope alexander vi , the mediator between portugal and spain . it wa signed on 7 june 1494 , and divided the newly discovered land outside europe between the two country along a meridian 370 league west of the cape verde island ( off the west coast of africa ) .
in 1498 , vasco da gama accomplished what christopher columbus set out for and became the first european to reach india by sea , bringing economic history of portugal and it population of 1.7 ; million resident , and helping to start the portuguese renaissance . in 1500 , the portuguese explorer gaspar corte-real reached what is now canada and founded the town of portugal cove-st. philip 's , newfoundland and labrador , long before the french and english in the 17th century , and being just one of many portuguese colonization of the america .
in 1500 , pedro lvares cabral discovered brazil and claimed it for portugal . ten year later , afonso de albuquerque conquered goa in india , muscat , oman and ormuz in the persian strait , and malacca , now a state of malaysia in malaysia . thus , the portuguese empire held dominion over commerce in the indian ocean and south atlantic . portuguese sailor set out to reach eastern asia by sailing eastward from europe , landing in such place a taiwan , japan , the island of timor , and in the moluccas .
although for a long period it wa believed the dutch people were the first european to arrive in australia , there is also some evidence that the theory of the portuguese discovery of australia in 1521 . from 1519 to 1522 , ferdinand magellan ( ferno de magalhes ) organized a spanish expedition to the east indie which resulted in the first circumnavigation of the globe . magellan never made it back to europe a he wa murdered by native in the philippine in 1521.
the treaty of zaragoza , signed on 22 april 1529 between portugal and spain , specified the anti-meridian to the line of demarcation specified in the treaty of tordesillas .
all these factor made portugal one of the world 's major economic , military , and political power from the 15th century until the late 16th century .
<section_title_start>  iberian union , restoration and early brigantine era  <section_title_end>
portugal voluntarily entered a dynastic union between 1580 and 1640 . this occurred because the last two king of the house of aviz ;  king sebastian of portugal , who died in the battle of alccer quibir in morocco , and his great-uncle and successor , king-cardinal ( catholic church ) henry i of portugal ;  both died without heir , resulting in the portuguese succession crisis of 1580.
subsequently , philip ii of spain claimed the throne and wa accepted a philip i of portugal . portugal did not lose it formal independence , briefly forming a iberian union of kingdom . at this time spain wa a geographic region . the joining of the two crown deprived portugal of an independent foreign policy and led to it involvement in the eighty year ' war between spain and the netherlands .
war led to a deterioration of the relation with anglo-portuguese alliance portugal 's oldest ally , england , and the loss of ormus , a strategic trading post located between iran and oman . from 1595 to 1663 the dutch-portuguese war primarily involved the dutch company invading many portuguese colony and commercial interest in brazil , africa , india and the far east , resulting in the loss of the portuguese indian sea trade monopoly .
in 1640 , john iv of portugal spearheaded an uprising backed by disgruntled noble and wa proclaimed king . the portuguese restoration war ended the sixty-year period of the iberian union under the house of habsburg . this wa the beginning of the house of braganza , which reigned in portugal until 1910.
king john iv 's eldest son came to reign a afonso vi of portugal , however his physical and mental disability left him overpowered by lu de vasconcelos e sousa , 3rd count of castelo melhor . in a palace coup organized by the king 's wife , maria francisca of savoy , and his brother , peter ii of portugal pedro , duke of beja , king afonso vi wa declared mentally incompetent and exiled first to the azores and then to the sintra national palace , outside lisbon . after afonso 's death , pedro came to the throne a king pedro ii . pedro 's reign saw the consolidation of national independence , imperial expansion , and investment in domestic production .
pedro ii 's son , john v of portugal , saw a reign characterized by the influx of gold into the coffer of the royal treasury , supplied largely by the royal fifth ( a tax on precious metal ) that wa received from the portuguese empire of state of brazil and state of maranho ( colonial ) .
disregarding traditional portuguese institution of governance , john v acted a an absolute monarch , nearly depleting the country 's tax revenue on ambitious architectural work , most notably mafra national palace , and on commission and addition for his sizeable art and literary collection .
owing to his craving for international diplomatic recognition , john also spent large sum on the embassy he sent to the court of europe , the most famous being those he sent to paris in 1715 and rome in 1716.
official estimate ;  and most estimate made so far ;  place the number of portuguese migrant to colonial brazil during the gold rush of the 18th century at 600,000 . this represented one of the largest movement of european population to their colony in the america during colonial time .
<section_title_start>  pombaline era and enlightenment  <section_title_end>
in 1738 , fidalgo sebastio jos de carvalho e melo , 1st marquis of pombal ( later ennobled a the 1st marquis of pombal ( title ) ) began a diplomatic career a the portuguese ambassador in london and later in vienna . the queen consort of portugal , maria anna of austria , wa fond of carvalho e melo ; and after his first wife died , she arranged the widowed carvalho e melo 's second marriage to the daughter of the austrian field marshal leopold josef , count von daun . king john v of portugal , however , wa not pleased and recalled carvalho e melo to portugal in 1749 . john v died the following year and his son , joseph i of portugal , wa crowned . in contrast to his father , joseph i wa fond of carvalho e melo , and with the queen mother 's approval , he appointed carvalho e melo a political minister of foreign affair .
a the king 's confidence in carvalho e melo increased , the king entrusted him with more control of the state . by 1755 , sebastio jos de carvalho e melo wa made prime minister . impressed by british economic success that he had witnessed from his time a an ambassador , he successfully implemented similar economic system policy in portugal . he slavery in portugal # banning in mainland portugal and in the portuguese colony in india , reorganized the army and the navy , restructured the university of coimbra , and ended legal discrimination against different christianity sect in portugal by abolishing the distinction between old christian and new christian .
carvalho e melo 's greatest reform were economic and financial , with the creation of several company and guild to regulate every commercial activity . he created one of the first appellation in the world by demarcating the region for production of port wine to ensure the wine 's quality ; and this wa the first attempt to control wine quality and production in europe . he ruled with a strong hand by imposing strict law upon all class of portuguese society from the high nobility to the poorest working class , along with a widespread review of the country 's tax system . these reform gained him enemy in the upper class , especially among the high nobility , who despised him a a social upstart .
disaster fell upon portugal in the morning of 1 november 1755 , when lisbon wa struck by 1755 lisbon earthquake with an estimated moment magnitude scale of 8.59 . the city wa razed to the ground by the earthquake and the subsequent tsunami and ensuing fire . carvalho e melo survived by a stroke of luck and then immediately embarked on rebuilding the city , with his famous quote : `` what now ? we bury the dead and take care of the living . ''
despite the calamity and huge death toll , lisbon suffered no epidemic and within le than one year wa already being rebuilt . the new city centre of lisbon wa designed to resist subsequent earthquake . architectural model were built for test , and the effect of an earthquake were simulated by having troop march around the model . the building and large square of the lisbon baixa still remain a one of lisbon 's tourist attraction . carvalho e melo also made an important contribution to the study of seismology by designing a detailed inquiry on the effect of the earthquake , the parochial memory of 1758 , that wa sent to every parish in the country ; this wealth of information allows modern scientist to reconstruct the event with some degree of scientific precision .
following the earthquake , joseph i of portugal gave his prime minister even more power , and carvalho de melo became a powerful , enlightened absolutism . a his power grew , his enemy increased in number , and bitter dispute with the upper nobility became frequent . in 1758 joseph i wa wounded in an attempted assassination . the marquis of tvora and the duke of aveiro were implicated and tvora affair . the following year , the society of jesus were suppression of the society of jesus and their asset confiscated by the crown . carvalho e melo spared none involved , even woman and child ( notably , 8-year-old leonor de almeida portugal , marquise of alorna , imprisoned in a convent for nineteen year ) . this wa the final stroke that crushed all opposition by publicly demonstrating even the aristocracy wa powerless before the king 's loyal minister . joseph i ennobled carvalho e melo a count of oeiras , portugal in 1759.
in 1762 , spanishportuguese war , 17611763 a part of the seven year ' war , but by 1763 the status quo between spain and portugal before the war had been restored .
following the tvora affair , the new count of oeiras knew no opposition . further titled `` marqus de pombal '' in 1770 , he effectively ruled portugal until joseph i 's death in 1777.
the new ruler , queen maria i of portugal , disliked the marqus de pombal because of the power he amassed , and never forgave him for the ruthlessness with which he dispatched the tvora family , and upon her accession to the throne , she withdrew all his political office . the marqus de pombal wa banished to his estate at pombal , portugal , where he died in 1782.
however , historian also argue that pombal 's `` enlightenment , '' while far-reaching , wa primarily a mechanism for enhancing autocracy at the expense of individual liberty and especially an apparatus for crushing opposition , suppressing criticism , and furthering colonial economic exploitation a well a intensifying book censorship and consolidating personal control and profit .
<section_title_start>  napoleonic era  <section_title_end>
with the occupation by napoleon , portugal began a slow but inexorable decline that lasted until the 20th century . this decline wa hastened by the independence of brazil , the country 's largest colonial possession .
in the autumn of 1807 , napoleon moved french troop through spain to invade portugal . from 1807 to 1811 , british-portuguese force would successfully fight against the french invasion of portugal in the peninsular war , during which the royal family and the portuguese nobility , including maria i , relocated to the colonial brazil , at that time a colony of the portuguese empire , in south america . this episode is known a the transfer of the portuguese court to brazil .
in 1807 , a napoleon 's army closed in on lisbon , joo vi of portugal , the prince regent , transferred his court to brazil and established rio de janeiro a the capital of the portuguese empire . in 1815 , brazil wa declared a kingdom and the kingdom of portugal wa united with it , forming a pluricontinental state , the united kingdom of portugal , brazil and the algarves .
a a result of the change in it status and the arrival of the portuguese royal family , brazilian administrative , civic , economic history of brazil # the economy at independence , 1822 , military , education in brazil # history , and brazilian science and technology # history apparatus were expanded and highly modernized . portuguese and their allied british troop fought against the french invasion of portugal and by 1815 the situation in europe had cooled down sufficiently that joo vi would have been able to return safely to lisbon . however , the king of portugal remained in brazil until the liberal revolution of 1820 , which started in porto , demanded his return to lisbon in 1821.
thus he returned to portugal but left his son pedro i of brazil in charge of brazil . when the portuguese government attempted the following year to return the kingdom of brazil to subordinate status , his son pedro , with the overwhelming support of the brazilian elite , declared war of independence of brazil brazil 's independence from portugal . cisplatina ( today 's sovereign state of uruguay ) , in the south , wa one of the last addition to the territory of brazil under portuguese rule .
brazilian independence wa recognized in 1825 , whereby emperor pedro i granted to his father the titular honour of emperor of brazil . john vi 's death in 1826 caused serious question in his succession . though pedro wa his heir , and reigned briefly a pedro iv , his status a a brazilian monarch wa seen a an impediment to holding the portuguese throne by both nation . pedro abdicated in favour of his daughter , maria ii of portugal ( mary ii ) . however , pedro 's brother , miguel i of portugal , claimed the throne in protest . after a proposal for miguel and maria to marry failed , miguel seized power a king miguel i , in 1828 . in order to defend his daughter 's right to the throne , pedro launched the portuguese civil war to reinstall his daughter and establish a constitutional monarchy in portugal . the war ended in 1834 , with miguel 's defeat , the promulgation of a constitution , and the reinstatement of queen maria ii .
<section_title_start>  constitutional monarchy  <section_title_end>
queen maria ii ( mary ii ) and king ferdinand ii of portugal 's son , king pedro v ( peter v ) modernized the country during his short reign ( 18531861 ) . under his reign , road , telegraph , and railway were constructed and improvement in public health advanced . his popularity increased when , during the cholera outbreak of 18531856 , he visited hospital handing out gift and comforting the sick . pedro 's reign wa short , a he died of cholera in 1861 , after a series of death in the royal family , including his two brother infante fernando of portugal and infante joo , duke of beja , and his wife , stephanie of hohenzollern-sigmaringen . pedro not having child , his brother , lu i of portugal ( louis i ) ascended the throne and continued his modernization .
at the height of european colonialism in the 19th century , portugal had already lost it territory in south america and all but a few base in asia . luanda , benguela , bissau , maputo , porto amboim and the island of mozambique were among the oldest portuguese-founded port city in it african territory . during this phase , portuguese colonialism focused on expanding it outpost in africa into nation-sized territory to compete with other european power there .
with the berlin conference ( 1884 ) of 1884 , portuguese territory in africa had their border formally established on request of portugal in order to protect the centuries-long portuguese interest in the continent from rivalry enticed by the scramble for africa . portuguese town and city in africa like nova lisboa , lubango , kuito , malanje , tete , vila junqueiro , vila pery and vila cabral were founded or redeveloped inland during this period and beyond . new coastal town like beira , mozambique , namibe , lobito , joo belo , nacala and porto amlia were also founded . even before the turn of the 20th century , railway track a the benguela railway in angola , and the beira railway in mozambique , started to be built to link coastal area and selected inland region .
other episode during this period of the portuguese presence in africa include the 1890 british ultimatum . this forced the portuguese military to retreat from the land between the portuguese colony of portuguese mozambique and portuguese angola ( most of present-day zimbabwe and zambia ) , which had been claimed by portugal and included in it `` pink map '' , which clashed with british aspiration to create a cape to cairo railway .
the portuguese territory in africa were portuguese cape verde , portuguese so tom and prncipe , portuguese guinea , angola ( portugal ) , and mozambique ( portugal ) . the tiny fortress of so joo baptista de ajud on the coast of dahomey , wa also under portuguese rule . in addition , portugal still ruled the asian territory of portuguese india , portuguese timor and portuguese macau .
on february 1 , 1908 , king dom carlos i of portugal and his [ apparent ] and his eldest son , luis filipe , prince royal of portugal , duke of braganza , lisbon regicide in the terreiro do pao by two portuguese republican activist revolutionary , alfredo lu da costa and manuel bua . under his rule , portugal had been declared bankrupt ; twice  first on june 14 , 1892 , and then again on may 10 , 1902 ;  causing social turmoil , economic disturbance , angry protest , revolt and criticism of the monarchy . his second and youngest son , manuel ii of portugal , became the new king , but wa eventually overthrown by the 5 october 1910 revolution , which abolished the monarchy and installed a republican government in portugal , causing him and his royal family to flee into exile in london , england .
<section_title_start>  first republic and estado novo  <section_title_end>
the new republic had many problem . portugal had 45 different government in just 15 year . during world war i ( 19141918 ) , portugal helped the ally of world war i fight the central power . but the war hurt it weak economy . political instability and economic weakness were fertile ground for chaos and unrest during the first portuguese republic . these condition would lead to the failed monarchy of the north , 28 may 1926 coup d'tat , and the creation of the national dictatorship ( ditadura nacional ) .
this in turn led to the establishment of the right-wing dictatorship of the estado novo ( portugal ) under antnio de oliveira salazar in 1933.
portugal remained neutral in world war ii .
from the 1940s to the 1960s , portugal wa a founding member of nato , oecd and the european free trade association ( efta ) . gradually , new economic development project and relocation of mainland portuguese citizen into the overseas province in africa were initiated , with portuguese angola and portuguese mozambique , a the largest and richest overseas territory , being the main target of those initiative . these action were used to affirm portugal 's status a a list of transcontinental country nation and not a a colonial empire .
after india attained independence in 1947 , pro-indian resident of dadra and nagar haveli , with the support of the indian government and the help of pro-independence organization , separated the territory of dadra and nagar haveli from portuguese rule in 1954 . in 1961 , fort of so joo baptista de ajud 's annexation by the republic of dahomey wa the start of a process that led to the final dissolution of the centuries-old portuguese empire .
according to the census of 1921 so joo baptista de ajud had 5 inhabitant and , at the moment of the ultimatum by the dahomey government , it had only 2 inhabitant representing portuguese sovereignty .
another forcible retreat from overseas territory occurred in december 1961 when portugal refused to relinquish the territory of goa , daman and diu in india . a a result , the portuguese army and navy were involved in armed conflict in it colony of portuguese india against the indian armed force .
the annexation of goa and surrender of the limited portuguese defensive garrison , which wa forced to surrender to a much larger military force . the outcome wa the loss of the remaining portuguese territory in the indian subcontinent . the portuguese regime refused to recognize indian sovereignty over the annexed territory , which continued to be represented in portugal 's national assembly until the military coup of 1974.
also in the early 1960s , independence movement in the portuguese overseas province of portuguese angola , portuguese mozambique and portuguese guinea in africa , resulted in the portuguese colonial war ( 19611974 ) .
throughout the colonial war period portugal had to deal with increasing dissent , arm embargo and other punitive sanction imposed by most of the international community . however , the authoritarian and conservative estado novo ( portugal ) regime , first installed and governed by antnio de oliveira salazar and from 1968 onwards led by marcelo caetano , tried to preserve a vast centuries-long intercontinental empire with a total area of 2,168,071 ; km2 .
<section_title_start>  carnation revolution and european integration  <section_title_end>
the portuguese government and army resisted the decolonization of it overseas territory until april 1974 , when a bloodless left-wing military coup in lisbon , known a the carnation revolution , led the way for the independence of the overseas territory in africa and asia , a well a for the restoration of democracy after two year of a transitional period known a prec ( processo revolucionrio em curso ) . this period wa characterized by social turmoil and power dispute between left- and right-wing political force . by the summer of 1975 , the tension between these wa so high , that the country wa on the verge of civil war . the force connected to the extreme left-wing launched a further coup d'tat on 25 november but the group of nine , a moderate military faction , immediately initiated a counter-coup . the main episode of this confrontation wa the successful assault on the barrack of the left-wing dominated 2nd lancer regiment ( portugal ) by the moderate force of the commando regiment , resulting in three soldier killed in action . the group of nine emerged victorious , thus preventing the establishment of a communism state in portugal and ending the period of political instability in the country . the retreat from the overseas territory and the acceptance of it independence term by portuguese head representative for overseas negotiation , which would create independent state in 1975 , prompted a mass exodus of portuguese citizen from portugal 's african territory ( mostly from portuguese overseas province of angola and overseas province of mozambique ) .
over one million white african # portuguese in africa fled the former portuguese province a white settler were usually not considered part of the new identity of the former portuguese colony in africa and asia . mrio soares and antnio de almeida santos were charged with organizing the independence of portugal 's overseas territory . by 1975 , all the portuguese african territory were independent and portugal held 1975 portuguese constituent assembly election in 50 year .
portugal continued to be governed by a junta de salvao nacional until the 1976 portuguese legislative election . it wa won by the socialist party ( portugal ) ( p ) and mrio soares , it leader , became prime minister of the 1st constitutional government on 23 july . mrio soares would be prime minister from 1976 to 1978 and again from 1983 to 1985 . in this capacity soares tried to resume the economic growth and development record that had been achieved before the carnation revolution , during the last decade of the previous regime . he initiated the process of accession to the european economic community ( eec ) by starting accession negotiation a early a 1977.
after the transition to democracy , portugal bounced between socialism and adherence to the neoliberal model . land reform and nationalization were enforced ; the portuguese constitution ( approved in 1976 ) wa rewritten in order to accommodate socialist and communist principle . until the constitutional revision of 1982 and 1989 , the constitution wa a document with numerous reference to socialism , the right of worker , and the desirability of a socialist economy . portugal 's economic situation after the revolution obliged the government to pursue international monetary fund ( imf ) -monitored stabilization program in 197778 and 198385 .
in 1986 , portugal , along with spain , joined the european economic community ( eec ) that later became the european union ( eu ) . in the following year portugal 's economy progressed considerably a a result of eec/eu structural and cohesion fund and portuguese company ' easier access to foreign market .
portugal 's last overseas and asian colonial territory , macau , wa peacefully handed over to the china people 's republic of china ( prc ) on december 20 , 1999 , under the 1987 joint declaration that set the term for macau 's handover from portugal to the prc . in 2002 , the independence of east timor ( asia ) wa formally recognized by portugal , after an incomplete decolonization process that wa started in 1975 because of the carnation revolution , but interrupted by an indonesian armed invasion and indonesian occupation of east timor .
on 26 march 1995 , portugal started to implement schengen area rule , eliminating border control with other schengen member while simultaneously strengthening border control with non-member state . in 1996 the country wa a co-founder of the community of portuguese language country ( cplp ) headquartered in lisbon . in 1996 , jorge sampaio became president . he won 2001 portuguese presidential election re-election in january 2001 . expo '98 took place in portugal and in 1999 it wa one of the founding country of the euro and the eurozone . on july 5 , 2004 , jos manuel barroso , then prime minister of portugal , wa nominated president of the european commission , the most powerful office in the european union . on 1 december 2009 , the treaty of lisbon entered into force , after it had been signed by the european union member state on 13 december 2007 in the jernimos monastery , in lisbon , enhancing the efficiency and democratic legitimacy of the union and improving the coherence of it action . the republic of ireland wa the only eu state to hold a democratic referendum on the lisbon treaty . it wa initially rejected by voter in 2008.
economic disruption and an unsustainable growth in government debt during the financial crisis of 20072008 led the country to negotiate in 2011 with the imf and the european union , through the european financial stability mechanism ( efsm ) and the european financial stability facility ( efsf ) , a loan to help the country stabilize it finance .

the territory of portugal includes an area on the iberian peninsula ( referred to a the continent by most portuguese ) and two archipelago in the atlantic ocean : the archipelago of madeira and the azores . it lie between latitude 30th parallel north 30 and 42nd parallel north 42 n , and longitude 32nd meridian west 32 and 6th meridian west 6 w.
continental portugal is split by it main river , the tagus , that flow from spain and disgorges in the tagus estuary natural reserve , in lisbon , before escaping into the atlantic . the northern landscape is mountainous towards the interior with several plateau indented by river valley , whereas the south , including the algarve and the alentejo region , is characterized by rolling plain .
portugal 's highest peak is the similarly named mount pico on the island of pico island in the azores . this ancient volcano , which measure is an iconic symbol of the azores , while the serra da estrela on the mainland ( the summit being above sea level ) is an important seasonal attraction for skier and winter sport enthusiast .
the archipelago of madeira and the azores are scattered within the atlantic ocean : the azores straddling the mid-atlantic ridge on a tectonic triple junction , and madeira along a range formed by plate tectonics in-plate [ ( geology ) hotspot ] geology . geologically , these island were formed by volcanic and seismic event . the last terrestrial volcanic eruption occurred in 195758 ( capelinhos ) and minor earthquake occur sporadically , usually of low intensity .
exclusive economic zone of portugal portugal 's exclusive economic zone , a sea zone over which the portuguese have special right over the exploration and use of marine resource , ha 1,727,408 ; km2 . this is the 3rd largest exclusive economic zone of the european union and the 20th largest in the world .
<section_title_start>  climate  <section_title_end>
portugal is mainly characterized by a mediterranean climate ( csa in the south , central interior , and the douro river valley ; csb in the north , central west and southwest alentejo and vicentine coast natural park vicentine coast ) , but ha other climatic characteristic such a a oceanic climate ( cfb ) in the mountain located in northwestern sector ( mainland ) and also in some high altitude zone of the azorean island , a semi-arid climate in certain part of the beja district far south ( bsk ) and in porto santo island ( bsh ) , a bwh ( bwh ) in the savage island and a humid subtropical climate in the western azores ( cfa ) , according to the kppen climate classification kppen-geiger climate classification . it is one of the warmest country in europe : the annual average temperature in mainland portugal varies from in the mountainous interior north to in the south and on the guadiana river basin . there are however , variation from the highland to the lowland : spanish biologist salvador rivas martinez present several different bioclimatic zone for portugal . the algarve , separated from the alentejo region by mountain reaching up to in fia ( mountain ) , ha a climate similar to that of the southern coastal area of spain or southwest australia .
annual average rainfall in the mainland varies from just over on the peneda-gers national park to le than in southern part of alentejo . mount pico is recognized a receiving the largest annual rainfall ( over per year ) in portugal , according to instituto portugus do mar e da atmosfera .
in some area , such a the guadiana basin , annual diurnal average temperature can be a high a , and summer 's highest temperature are routinely over . the record high of wa recorded in amareleja , although this might not be the hottest spot in summer , according to satellite reading .
snowfall occur regularly in the winter in the interior north and centre of the country in district such a guarda district , bragana district , viseu district and vila real district , particularly on the mountain . in winter , temperature may drop below , particularly in serra da estrela , serra do gers , serra do maro and montesinho natural park . in these place snow can fall any time from october to may . in the south of the country snowfall are rare but still occur in the highest elevation . while the official absolute minimum by instituto portugus do mar e da atmosfera is in penhas da sade and miranda do douro , lower temperature have been recorded , such a by bragana , portugal polytechnic institute in the outskirt of the city in 1983 , and below in serra da estrela .
continental portugal ha around 2300 to 3200 hour of sunshine a year , an average of 46 ; h in winter and 1012 ; h in the summer , with higher value in the south-east , south-west and the algarve coast and lower in the north-west . insolation value are lower in the archipelago , with around 1600 h in the humid flores island ( azores ) and around 2300 h in the island of madeira and porto santo . insolation in the salvage is thought to be higher due to weaker orographic lift and their relative proximity to the sahara desert .

the average sea surface temperature on the west coast of mainland portugal varies from in januarymarch to in augustoctober while on the south coast it range from in januarymarch and rise in the summer to about , occasionally reaching . in the azores , around in februaryapril to in julyseptember , and in madeira , around in februaryapril to in augustoctober .
both the archipelago of the azores and madeira have a subtropical climate , although variation between island exist , making weather prediction very difficult ( owing to rough topography ) . the madeira and azorean archipelago have a narrower temperature range , with annual average temperature exceeding in some part of the coast ( according to the portuguese meteorological institute ) . some island in azores do have drier month in the summer . consequently , the island of the azores have been identified a having a mediterranean climate ( both csa and csb type ) , while some island ( such a flores island ( azores ) or corvo island ) are classified a humid subtropical ( cfa ) , transitioning into an oceanic climate ( cfb ) at higher altitude , according to kppen-geiger classification .
porto santo island in madeira ha a warm semi-arid climate ( bsh ) . the savage island , which are part of the regional territory of madeira and a nature reserve are unique in being classified a a desert climate ( bwh ) with an annual average rainfall of approximately . the sea surface temperature in these island varies from in winter to in the summer occasionally reaching .

in gers both mature deciduous and coniferous forest can be found , an extremely rare worldwide mature mediterranean forest remain in some part of the arrbida mountain and a subtropical laurissilva forest , dating back to the tertiary period , cover it largest continuous area in the world in the madeira main island . due to the human population decrease and rural exodus , pyrenean oak and other local native tree are colonizing many abandoned area .
boar , iberian red deer , roe deer , and the iberian wild goat , are reported to have expanded greatly during recent decade . boar were found recently roaming at night inside large urban area , like in setubal . protected area of portugal include one national park , 12 natural park , nine natural reserve , five natural monument , and seven protected landscape , which include the parque nacional da peneda-gers , the parque natural da serra da estrela and the paul de arzila paul d'arzila .

laurisilva is a unique type of subtropical rainforest , which nowadays , in europe , is only restricted to the iberian peninsula : in the azores , and in particular on the island of madeira , there are large forest of endemic laurisilva ( the latter protected a a natural heritage preserve ) .
there are several specie of diverse mammalian fauna , including the red fox , european badger , iberian lynx , iberian wolf , wild goat ( capra pyrenaica ) , wild cat ( felis silvestris ) , granada hare , weasel , european polecat , common chameleon , egyptian mongoose , common genet , the occasional brown bear and many others . portugal is an important stopover for migratory bird , in place such a cape st. vincent or the serra de monchique mountain , where thousand of bird cross from europe to africa during the autumn or in the spring ( return migration ) .
most of the avian specie congregate along the iberian peninsula since it is the closest stopover between northern europe and africa . six hundred bird specie occur in portugal ( either for nesting or during the course of migration ) , and annually there are new registry of nesting specie . the archipelago of the azores and madeira are transient stopover for american , european , and african bird , while continental portugal mostly encounter european and african bird specie .
there are more than 100 freshwater fish specie , varying from the giant european catfish ( in the tagus international natural park ) to some small and endemic specie that live only in small lake ( along the western portion of country , for example ) . some of these rare and specific specie are highly endangered because of habitat loss , pollution and drought . up-welling along the west coast of portugal make the sea extremely rich in nutrient and diverse specie of marine fish ; the portuguese marine water are one of the richest in the world . marine fish specie are more common , and include thousand of specie , such a the sardine ( sardina pilchardus ) , tuna and atlantic mackerel . bioluminescent specie are also well represented ( including specie in different colour spectrum and form ) , like the glowing plankton that are possible to observe on some beach .
there are many endemic insect specie , most only found in certain part of portugal , while other specie are more widespread like the stag beetle ( lucanus cervus ) and the cicada . the macaronesian island ( azores and madeira ) have many endemic specie ( like bird , reptile , bat , insect , snail and slug ) that evolved independently from other region of portugal . in madeira , for example , it is possible to observe more than 250 specie of land gastropod .

portugal ha considerable resource of wind and river power , the two most cost-effective renewable energy source . since the turn of the 21st century , there ha been a trend towards the development of a renewable resource industry and reduction of both consumption and use of fossil fuel . in 2006 , the world 's largest solar energy plant at that date , the moura photovoltaic power station , began operating near moura , portugal , in the south , while the world 's first commercial wave power farm , the aguadoura wave farm , opened in the norte region , portugal ( 2008 ) . by the end of 2006 , 66 % of the country 's electrical production wa from coal and fuel power plant , while 29 % were derived from [ dam , and 6 % by wind energy ] .
in 2008 , renewable energy resource were producing 43 % of the nation 's consumption of electricity , even a hydroelectric production decreased with severe drought . a of june 2010 , electricity export had outnumbered import . in the period between january and may 2010 , 70 % of the national production of energy came from renewable source .
portugal 's national energy transmission company , [ [ redes energticas nacionais ( ren ) , us sophisticated modelling to predict weather , especially wind pattern , and computer program to calculate energy from the various renewable-energy plant .
before the solar/wind revolution , portugal had generated electricity from hydropower plant on it river for decade . new programme combine wind and water : wind-driven turbine pump water uphill at night , the most blustery period ; then the water flow downhill by day , generating electricity , when consumer demand is highest . portugal 's distribution system is also now a two-way street . instead of just delivering electricity , it draw electricity from even the smallest generator , like rooftop solar panel . the government aggressively encouraged such contribution by setting a premium price for those who buy rooftop-generated solar electricity .
<section_title_start>  demographic  <section_title_end>
the statistic portugal ( ine  instituto nacional de estatstica ( portugal ) ) estimate that , according to the 2011 census , the population wa 10,562,178 ( of which 52 % wa female , 48 % wa male ) . in 2019 and according to more up-to-date figure , the population decreased to 10,295,909 , although it wa an increase compared with 2018 . this population ha been relatively homogeneous for most of it history : a single religion ( roman catholicism ) and a single language have contributed to this ethnic and national unity .
the most important demographic influence in the modern portuguese seems to be the oldest one ; current interpretation of y-chromosome and mtdna data suggests that the portuguese have their origin in paleolithic people that began arriving to the european continent around 45,000 year ago . all subsequent migration did leave an impact , genetically and culturally , but the main population source of the portuguese is still paleolithic . genetic study show portuguese population not to be significantly different from other european population . portuguese people have a preponderancy of genetics ( iron age period ) which belong to r1b haplogroup family along with brittonic language , alpine state and goidelic language genetical marker . also expectable but not so common are south european ( sardinian , italian and balkan ) , broadly northwestern ( west germanic ) and to a lesser extent british/irish ( brythonic/gaelic ) and french ( alpine ) . with a low confidence range there are scandinavian and east european genetical marker . other source would point out a small presence of berber and jewish that would be also part of a low confidence region .
native portuguese are an iberian peninsula ethnic group and they form 95 % of the whole population , whose ancestry is very similar to spaniard and have strong tie with fellow atlantic europe like ireland , british isle , france and belgium due to maritime trade dated a far back a the bronze age . these maritime contact and the prevalence of r1b haplogroup a the main genetical marker of these country suggest a common ancestry and cultural proximity . other maritime contact with the mediterranean especially with greek , phoenician , roman and moor add some particular phenotype in southern portugal and particularly southern spain ( tartessos culture ) making portugal and northwestern spain a bridge between north western europe and the mediterranean but maintaining the atlantic character .
despite the good economic development in the past three decade the portuguese were the shortest in europe since 1890 . this emerging height gap took place in the 1840s and ha increased since . one of the driving factor wa the modest real wage development , given the late industrialization and economic growth in portugal compared to the european core . another determinant wa the delayed [ capital ] formation .
the total fertility rate ( tfr ) wa estimated at 1.52 child born/woman , one of the lowest in the world , which is below the replacement rate of 2.1 , it remains considerably below the high of 5.02 child born per woman in 1911 . in 2016 , 52.8 % of birth were to unmarried woman .
like most western country , portugal ha to deal with low fertility level : the country ha experienced a sub-replacement fertility rate since the 1980s . portugal subsequently ha the 17th oldest population in the world , with the average age of 43.7 year .
the structure of portuguese society is characterized by a significant inequality which in 2016 placed the country in the lowest seventh of the social justice index for the european union .
portugal 's parliament in 2018 approved a budget plan for 2019 that includes tax break for returning emigrant in a bid to lure back those who left during the financial crisis of 20072008 . the expansionary 2019 budget , backed by a left-wing majority in parliament , also aim to boost the purchasing power of household while cutting the already low deficit even further . circular migration will be allowed to declare only half their taxable income for five year if they return , provided they lived abroad for at least three year . the `` return programme '' is to run for two year . around 500,000 resident left portugal between 2010 and 2015 after the great recession . although some 350,000 have since returned , lisbon want to tempt the rest to come home  in a similar scheme to the irish one . portugal ha approved a credit line for portuguese emigrant aiming to invest in the country on their return . furthermore , emigrant returning in 2019 and 2020 will see their tax halved a part of the stimulus to bring native portuguese back and revitalize the population and promote continued economic growth  a portugal struggle with a low birth rate and an ageing population . according to projection by the national statistic office , portugal 's population will fall to 7.7 million by 2080 from 10.3 million now and the population will continue to age .

<section_title_start> etymology <section_title_end>
the word tunisia is derived from tunis ; a central urban hub and the capital of modern-day tunisia . the present form of the name , with it latinate suffix , evolved from french tunisie , in turn generally associated with the berber language root  , transcribed tn , which mean `` to lay down '' or `` encampment '' . it is sometimes also associated with the punic goddess tanit tanith ( aka tunit ) , ancient city of tyne .
the french derivative tunisie wa adopted in some european language with slight modification , introducing a distinctive name to designate the country . other language remained untouched , such a the russian  ( ) and spanish tnez . in this case , the same name is used for both country and city , a with the arabic  rtl=yes , and only by context can one tell the difference .
before tunisia , the territory 's name wa ifriqiya or africa ( roman province ) , which gave the present-day name of the continent africa .
<section_title_start> history <section_title_end>
<section_title_start> antiquity <section_title_end>
farming method reached the nile from the fertile crescent region about 5000 bc , and spread to the maghreb by about 4000 bc . agricultural community in the humid coastal plain of central tunisia then were ancestor of today 's berber people tribe .
it wa believed in ancient time that africa wa originally populated by gaetulians and libyan , both nomadic people . according to the roman historian sallust , the demigod hercules died in spain and his polyglot eastern army wa left to settle the land , with some human migration to africa . persian went to the west and intermarried with the gaetulians and became the numidian . the medes settled and were known a mauri , later moor .
the numidian and moor belonged to the race from which the berber are descended . the translated meaning of numidian is nomad and indeed the people were semi-nomadic until the reign of masinissa of the massyli tribe .
at the beginning of recorded history , tunisia wa inhabited by berber people tribe . it coast wa settled by phoenician starting a early a the 12th century bc ( bizerte , utica , tunisia ) . the city of carthage wa founded in the 9th century bc by phoenician . legend say that dido ( queen of carthage ) from tyre , now in modern-day lebanon , founded the city in 814 bc , a retold by the greek writer timaeus ( historian ) . the settler of carthage brought their culture and religion from phoenicia , now present-day lebanon and adjacent area .
after the series of war with greek city-state of sicily in the 5th century bc , carthage rose to power and eventually became the dominant civilization in the western mediterranean . the people of carthage worshipped a pantheon of middle eastern god including baal and tanit . tanit 's symbol , a simple female figure with extended arm and long dress , is a popular icon found in ancient site . the founder of carthage also established a tophet , which wa altered in roman time .
a carthaginian invasion of italy led by hannibal during the second punic war , one of a series of war with roman republic , nearly crippled the rise of roman power . from the conclusion of the second punic war in 202 bc , carthage functioned a a client state of the roman republic for another 50 year .
following the battle of carthage ( c. 149 bc ) which began in 149 bc during the third punic war , carthage wa conquered by rome in 146 bc . following it conquest , the roman renamed carthage to africa ( roman province ) , incorporating it a a province .
during the roman period , the area of what is now tunisia enjoyed a huge development . the economy , mainly during the empire , boomed : the prosperity of the area depended on agriculture . called the granary of the empire , the area of actual tunisia and coastal tripolitania , according to one estimate , produced one million ton of cereal each year , one-quarter of which wa exported to the empire . additional crop included bean , fig , grape , and other fruit .
by the 2nd century , olive oil rivaled cereal a an export item . in addition to the cultivation and the capture and transporting of exotic wild animal from the western mountain , the principal production and export included the textile , marble , wine , timber , livestock , pottery such a african red slip , and wool .
there wa even a huge production of mosaic and ceramic , exported mainly to italy , in the central area of el djem ( where there wa the second biggest amphitheater in the roman empire ) .
berber bishop donatus magnus wa the founder of a christian group known a the donatist . during the 5th and 6th century ( from 430 to 533 ad ) , the germanic vandal invaded and ruled over a kingdom in northwest africa that included present-day tripoli . the region wa easily reconquered in 533534 ad , during the rule of emperor justinian i , by the byzantine empire led by general belisarius .
<section_title_start> middle ages <section_title_end>
sometime between the second half of the 7th century and the early part of the 8th century , arab muslim conquest of the maghreb . they founded the first islamic city in northwest africa , kairouan . it wa there in 670 ad that the mosque of uqba , or the great mosque of kairouan , wa constructed . this mosque is the oldest and most prestigious sanctuary in the muslim west with the oldest standing minaret in the world ; it is also considered a masterpiece of islamic art and architecture .
tunis wa taken in 695 , re-taken by the byzantine eastern roman in 697 , but lost permanently in 698 . the transition from a latin-speaking christian berber society to a muslim and mostly arabic-speaking society took over 400 year ( the equivalent process in egypt and the fertile crescent took 600 year ) and resulted in the final disappearance of christianity and latin in the 12th or 13th century . the majority of the population were not muslim until quite late in the 9th century ; a vast majority were during the 10th . also , some tunisian christian emigrated ; some richer member of society did so after the conquest in 698 and others were welcomed by norman ruler to sicily or italy in the 11th and 12th century  the logical destination because of the 1200 year close connection between the two region .
the arab governor of tunis founded the aghlabids , which ruled tunisia , tripolitania and eastern algeria from 800 to 909 . tunisia flourished under arab rule when extensive system were constructed to supply town with water for household use and irrigation that promoted agriculture ( especially olive production ) . this prosperity permitted luxurious court life and wa marked by the construction of new palace city such a al-abassiya ( 809 ) and raqadda ( 877 ) .
after conquering cairo , the fatimids abandoned tunisia and part of eastern algeria to the local zirids ( 9721148 ) . zirid tunisia flourished in many area : agriculture , industry , trade , and religious and secular learning . management by the later zirid emir wa neglectful though , and political instability wa connected to the decline of tunisian trade and agriculture .
the depredation of the tunisian campaign by the banu hilal , a warlike arab bedouin tribe encouraged by the fatimids of egypt to seize northwest africa , sent the region 's rural and urban economic life into further decline . consequently , the region underwent rapid urbanisation a famine depopulated the countryside and industry shifted from agriculture to manufacture . the arab historian ibn khaldun wrote that the land ravaged by banu hilal invader had become completely arid desert .
the main tunisian city were conquered by the norman of sicily under the kingdom of africa in the 12th century , but following the conquest of tunisia in 11591160 by the almohads the norman were evacuated to sicily . community of tunisian christian would still exist in nefzaoua up to the 14th century . the almohads initially ruled over tunisia through a governor , usually a near relative of the caliph . despite the prestige of the new master , the country wa still unruly , with continuous rioting and fighting between the townsfolk and wandering arab and turk , the latter being subject of the muslim armenian adventurer karakush . also , tunisia wa occupied by ayyubids between 1182 and 1183 and again between 1184 and 1187.
the greatest threat to almohad rule in tunisia wa the banu ghaniya , relative of the almoravid , who from their base in mallorca tried to restore almoravid rule over the maghreb . around 1200 they succeeded in extending their rule over the whole of tunisia until they were crushed by almohad troop in 1207 . after this success , the almohads installed walid abu hafs a the governor of tunisia . tunisia remained part of the almohad state , until 1230 when the son of abu hafs declared himself independent . during the reign of the hafsid dynasty , fruitful commercial relationship were established with several christian mediterranean state . in the late 16th century the coast became a pirate stronghold .
<section_title_start> ottoman tunisia <section_title_end>
in the last year of the hafsid dynasty , spain seized many of the coastal city , but these were recovered by the ottoman empire .
the conquest of tunis ( 1534 ) took place in 1534 under the command of hayreddin barbarossa , the younger brother of oru real , who wa the kapudan pasha of the ottoman navy during the reign of suleiman the magnificent . however , it wa not until the conquest of tunis ( 1574 ) in 1574 under kapudan pasha ulu ali real that the ottoman permanently acquired the former history of medieval tunisia # hafsid dynasty of tunis , retaining it until the french conquest of tunisia in 1881.
initially under turkish rule from algiers , soon the ottoman porte appointed directly for tunis a governor called the pasha supported by janissary force . before long , however , tunisia became in effect an autonomous province , under the local bey . under it turkish people governor , the bey , tunisia attained virtual independence . the husainid dynasty of bey , established in 1705 , lasted until 1957 . this evolution of status wa from time to time challenged without success by algiers . during this era the governing council controlling tunisia remained largely composed of a foreign elite who continued to conduct state business in the turkish language .
attack on european shipping were made by barbary corsair , primarily from algiers , but also from tunis and tripoli , yet after a long period of declining raid the growing power of the european state finally forced it termination . under the ottoman empire , the boundary of tunisia contracted ; it lost territory to the west ( constantine , algeria ) and to the east ( tripoli ) .
the second plague pandemic ravaged tunisia in 17841785 , 17961797 and 18181820 .
in the 19th century , the ruler of tunisia became aware of the ongoing effort at political and social tanzimat . the bey of tunis then , by his own light but informed by the turkish example , attempted to effect a modernizing reform of institution and the economy . tunisian international debt grew unmanageable . this wa the reason or pretext for french force to establish a history of french era tunisia in 1881.
<section_title_start> french tunisia ( 18811956 )  <section_title_end>
in 1869 , tunisia declared itself bankrupt and an international financial commission took control over it economy . in 1881 , using the pretext of a tunisian incursion into algeria , the french invaded with an army of about 36,000 and forced the bey to agree to the term of the 1881 treaty of bardo ( al qasr a sa'id ) . with this treaty , tunisia wa officially made a french occupation of tunisia , over the objection of italy . under french colonization , european settlement in the country were actively encouraged ; the number of french people colonist grew from 34,000 in 1906 to 144,000 in 1945 . in 1910 there were 105,000 italian tunisian .
during world war ii , french tunisia wa ruled by the collaborationist vichy france government located in metropolitan france . the antisemitic vichy anti-jewish legislation enacted by the vichy wa also implemented in vichy northwest africa and overseas french territory . thus , the persecution , and murder of the jew from 1940 to 1943 wa part of the the holocaust in france .
from november 1942 until may 1943 , vichy tunisia wa occupied by nazi germany . s commander walter rauff continued to implement the final solution there . from 19421943 , tunisia wa the scene of the tunisia campaign , a series of battle between the axis power and ally of world war ii force . the battle opened with initial success by the german and italian force , but the massive supply and numerical superiority of the ally led to the tunisian campaign on 13 may 1943.

<section_title_start>  pre-colonial era ( 15001800 )  <section_title_end>
in the 16th century , portuguese explorer were the first european to begin significant , direct trade with people of southern nigeria protectorate , at the port they named lagos and in calabar along the region slave coast of west africa . european traded good with people at the coast ; coastal trade with european also marked the beginning of the atlantic slave trade . the port of calabar on the historical bight of bonny ( now commonly referred to a the bight of bonny ) became one of the largest slave trading post in west africa in the era of the transatlantic slave trade . other major slaving port in nigeria were located in badagry , lagos on the bight of benin and on bonny island on the bight of biafra . the majority of those enslaved and taken to these port were captured in raid and war . usually the captive were taken back to the conqueror ' territory a forced labour ; after time , they were sometimes acculturated and absorbed into the conqueror ' society . a number of slave route were established throughout nigeria linking the hinterland area with the major coastal port . some of the more prolific slave trading kingdom who participated in the transatlantic history of slavery were linked with the edo 's benin empire in the south , oyo empire in the southwest , and the aro confederacy in the southeast . benin 's power lasted between the 15th and 19th century . their dominance reached a far a the city of eko ( an edo language name later changed to lagos by the portuguese empire ) and further . oyo , at it territorial zenith in the late 17th to early 18th century , extended it influence from western nigeria to modern-day togo . the edo 's benin empire is located in southwestern nigeria .
in the north , the incessant fighting amongst the hausa city-state and the decline of the bornu empire gave rise to the fulani people gaining headway into the region . until this point , the fulani a nomadic ethnic group primarily traversed the semi-arid climate semi-desert sahelian region , north of the sudan , with cattle and avoided trade and intermingling with the sudanic people . at the beginning of the 19th century , usman dan fodio led a successful fulani war against the hausa kingdom founding the centralised sokoto caliphate ( also known a the fulani empire ) . the empire with arabic a it official language grew rapidly under his rule and that of list of sultan of sokoto , who sent out fula jihad in every direction . the vast landlocked empire connected the east with the west sudan region and made inroad down south conquering part of the oyo empire ( modern-day kwara state ) , and advanced towards the yorubaland of ibadan , with the goal of reaching the atlantic ocean . the territory controlled by the empire included much of modern-day northern and central nigeria . the sultan sent out emir to establish a suzerainty over the conquered territory and promote islamic civilization , the emir in turn became increasingly rich and powerful through trade and slavery . by the 1890s , the largest slavery in africa in the world , about two million , wa concentrated in the territory of the sokoto caliphate . the use of slave labor wa extensive , especially in agriculture . by the time of it break-up in 1903 into various european colony , the sokoto caliphate wa one of the largest pre-colonial african state .

a changing legal imperative ( transatlantic slave trade outlawed by britain in 1807 ) and economic imperative ( a desire for political and social stability ) led most european power to support the widespread cultivation of agricultural product , such a the palm , for use in european industry . the atlantic slave trade wa engaged in by european company until it wa outlawed in 1807 . after that illegal smuggler purchased slave along the coast by native slaver . britain 's west africa squadron sought to intercept the smuggler at sea . the rescued slave were taken to freetown , a colony in west africa originally established for the resettlement of freed slave from britain . britain intervened in the lagos kingship power struggle by bombarding lagos in 1851 , deposing the slave trade friendly oba kosoko , helping to install the amenable oba akitoye , and signing the treaty between great britain and lagos , 1 january 1852 on 1january 1852 . united kingdom annexed lagos a a crown colony in august 1861 with the lagos treaty of cession . british missionary expanded their operation and traveled further inland . in 1864 , samuel ajayi crowther became the first african church of nigeria .
in 1885 , british claim to a west african sphere of influence received recognition from other european nation at the berlin conference . the following year , it chartered the royal niger company under the leadership of sir george taubman goldie . by the late 19th and early 20th century , the company had vastly succeeded in subjugating the independent southern kingdom along the niger river , the british conquered benin empire in 1897 , and , in the anglo-aro war ( 19011902 ) , defeated other opponent . the defeat of these state opened up the niger area to british rule . in 1900 , the company 's territory came under the direct control of the british government and established the southern nigeria protectorate a a british protectorate and part of the british empire , the foremost world power at the time .
by 1902 , the british had begun plan to move north into the sokoto caliphate . lord frederick lugard , 1st baron lugard a british general , wa tasked by the colonial office to implement the agenda . lugard used rivalry between many of the emir in the southern reach of the caliphate and the central sokoto administration to prevent any defense a he worked towards the capital . a the british approached the city of sokoto , the new sultan muhammadu attahiru i organized a quick defense of the city and fought the advancing british-led force . the british force quickly won , sending attahiru i and thousand of follower on a mahdist hijra ( islam ) . in the northeast , the decline of the kanembornu empire gave rise to the british-controlled borno emirate which established abubakar garbai of borno a the ruler .
in 1903 , the british-victory in the battle of kano ( 1903 ) gave them a logistical edge in battle of kwatarkwashi and part of the former bornu empire . on march 13 , 1903 , at the grand market square of sokoto , the last sokoto grand vizier officially conceded to british rule . the british appointed muhammadu attahiru ii a the new caliph . frederick lugard , 1st baron lugard abolished the caliphate , but retained the title sultan a a symbolic position in the newly organized northern nigeria protectorate . this remnant became known a `` sokoto sultanate council '' . in june 1903 , the british defeated the remaining force of attahirui and killed him ; by 1906 resistance to british rule had ended .
amalgamation
on 1 january 1914 , the british formally united the southern nigeria protectorate and the northern nigeria protectorate into the colonial nigeria . administratively , nigeria remained divided into the northern nigeria and southern nigeria protectorate protectorate and lagos colony . inhabitant of the southern region sustained more interaction , economic and cultural , with the british and other european owing to the coastal economy .
christian mission established western educational institution in the protectorate . under britain 's policy of indirect rule and validation of islamic tradition , the crown did not encourage the operation of christian mission in the northern , islamic part of the country . some child of the southern elite went to great britain to pursue higher education . by independence in 1960 , regional difference in modern educational access were marked . the legacy , though le pronounced , continues to the present day . imbalance between north and south were expressed in nigeria 's political life a well . for instance , northern nigeria did not outlaw african slave trade until 1936 whilst in other part of nigeria slavery wa abolished soon after colonialism .
following world war ii , in response to the growth of nigerian nationalism and demand for independence , successive constitution legislated by the british government moved nigeria toward self-government on a representative and increasingly federal basis . by the middle of the 20th century , a great decolonization of africa wa sweeping across africa . nigeria achieved independence in 1960.
<section_title_start>  independence and first republic ( 19601966 )  <section_title_end>
nigeria gained independence from the united kingdom on 1 october 1960 , a the federation of nigeria , while retaining the british monarch , elizabeth ii , a nominal head of state and queen of nigeria . independent nigeria 's founding government wa a coalition of conservative party : the northern people 's congress ( npc ) led by sir ahmadu bello , a party dominated by muslim northerner , and the igbo and christian-dominated national council of nigeria and the cameroon ( ncnc ) led by nnamdi azikiwe . azikiwe replaced the colonial governor-general in november 1960 . the opposition comprised the comparatively liberal action group ( nigeria ) ( ag ) , which wa largely dominated by the yoruba people and led by obafemi awolowo . at independence , the cultural and political difference were sharp among nigeria 's dominant ethnic group : the hausafulani ( 'northern region , nigeria ' ) , igbo people ( 'eastern region , nigeria ' ) and yoruba people ( 'western nigeria ' ) . an imbalance wa created in the polity by the result of the southern cameroon # trust territory . southern cameroon ( since renamed by separatist a ambazonia ) opted to join the the republic of cameroon while northern cameroon chose to join nigeria . the northern part of the country then became larger than the southern part . in 1963 , the nation established a federal republic , with azikiwe a it first president of nigeria . when election were held in 1965 , the nigerian national democratic party came to power in nigeria 's western region .
<section_title_start>  military rule and civil war ( 19661979 )  <section_title_end>
the disequilibrium and perceived corruption of the electoral and political process led , in 1966 , to back-to-back military coup . the 1966 nigerian coup d'tat and wa led mostly by igbo people soldier under major emmanuel ifeajuna and chukwuma kaduna nzeogwu . the coup plotter succeeded in assassinating sir ahmadu bello and abubakar tafawa balewa alongside prominent leader of the northern region , nigeria and also premier samuel akintola of the western region , nigeria , but the coup plotter struggled to form a central government . senate president nwafor orizu handed over government control to the nigerian army , then under the command of another igbo officer , general johnson aguiyi-ironsi . later , nigerian counter-coup of 1966 the counter-coup of 1966 , supported primarily by northern military officer , facilitated the rise yakubu gowon a military head of state . tension rose between north and south ; 1966 anti-igbo pogrom and many fled to the eastern region , nigeria .
in may 1967 , governor of the eastern region , nigeria lt . colonel emeka ojukwu declared the region independent from the federation a a state called the republic of biafra , under his leadership . this declaration precipitated the nigerian civil war , which began a the official nigerian government side attacked biafra on 6 july 1967 at garkem . the 30-month war , with a long siege of biafra and it isolation from trade and supply , ended in january 1970 . estimate of the list of war by death toll in the former eastern region during the 30-month civil war range from one to three million . france , egypt , the soviet union , britain , israel , and others were deeply involved in the civil war behind the scene . britain and the soviet union were the main military backer of the nigerian government ; with nigeria utilizing air support from egyptian pilot provided by gamal abdel nasser , while france and israel aided the biafrans . the democratic republic of the congo government , under president of the democratic republic of the congo mobutu sese seko joseph-dsir mobutu , took an early stand on the biafran secession , voicing strong support for the nigerian federal government and deploying thousand of troop to fight against the secessionist .
following the war , nigeria enjoyed the oil boom of the 1970s , during which the country joined opec and received huge oil revenue . despite these revenue , the military government did little to improve the standard of living of the population , help small and medium business , or invest in infrastructure . a oil revenue fueled the rise of federal subsidy to state , the federal government became the centre of political struggle and the threshold of power in the country . a oil production and revenue rose , the nigerian government became increasingly dependent on oil revenue and international commodity market for budgetary and economic concern . the 1975 nigerian coup d'tat , led by general shehu musa yar'adua and joseph garba ousted gowon , who fled to britain . the coup plotter wanted to replace gowon 's autocratic rule with a triumvirate of three brigadier general whose decision could be vetoed by a supreme military council of nigeria ( 19661979 ) . for this triumvirate , they convinced general murtala mohammad to become military head of state , with general olusegun obasanjo a his second-in-command , and general theophilus danjuma a the third . together , the triumvirate introduced austerity measure to stem inflation , established a corrupt practice investigation bureau , replaced all military governor with new officer , and launched `` operation deadwood '' through which they fired 11,000 official from the civil service .
colonel buka suka dimka launched the 1976 nigerian coup d'tat attempt february 1976 coup against nigeria 's government , during which general murtala mohammed wa assassinated . dimka lacked widespread support among the military and his coup failed , forcing him to flee . after the coup attempt , general olusegun obasanjo wa appointed military head of state . a head of state , obasanjo vowed to continue murtala 's policy . aware of the danger of alienating northern nigerian , obasanjo brought general shehu yar'adua a his replacement and second-in-command a vice president of nigeria chief of staff , supreme headquarters completing the military triumvirate , with obasanjo a head of state and general theophilus danjuma a chief of army staff ( nigeria ) , the three went on to re-establish control over the nigerian military junta of 196679 and 198399 and organized the military 's transfer of power programme : state of nigeria and national delimitation , local government area of nigeria and the constitution of nigeria # 1979 constitution ( second republic ) of the second nigerian republic .
<section_title_start>  civilian rule and second republic ( 19791983 )  <section_title_end>
in 1977 , a constituent assembly wa elected to draft a new constitution , which wa published on september 21 , 1978 , when the ban on political activity wa lifted . the military carefully planned the return to civilian rule putting in place measure to ensure that political party had broader support than witnessed during the first republic . in 1979 , five political party competed in a series of election in which alhaji shehu shagari of the national party of nigeria ( npn ) wa elected president . all five party won representation in the national assembly . on october 1 , 1979 , shehu shagari wa sworn in a the first president of nigeria president and commander-in-chief of the federal republic of nigeria . obasanjo peacefully transferred power to shagari , becoming the first head of state in nigerian history to willingly step down .
the shagari government became viewed a corrupt by virtually all sector of nigerian society . in 1983 the inspector of the state-owned nigerian national petroleum corporation ( nnpc ) began to notice `` the slow poisoning of the water of this country '' . in august 1983 shagari and the npn were returned to power in a landslide victory , with a majority of seat in the national assembly and control of 12 state government . but the election were marred by violence and allegation of widespread vote rigging and electoral malfeasance led to legal battle over the result . there were also uncertainty , such a in the first republic , that political leader may be unable to govern properly which would bring another batch of new military ruler .
<section_title_start>  military rule and third republic ( 19831999 )  <section_title_end>
the 1983 nigerian coup d'tat 1983 military coup d'tat took place on new year 's eve of that year . it wa coordinated by key officer of the nigerian military and led to the overthrow of the second nigerian republic and the installation of major general muhammadu buhari a head of state . the military coup of muhammadu buhari shortly after the regime 's re-election in 1984 wa generally viewed a a positive development . buhari promised major reform , but his government fared little better than it predecessor . his regime wa overthrown by another military coup in 1985.
general buhari wa overthrown in 1985 nigerian coup d'tat 1985 military coup d'tat led by general ibrahim babangida , who established the armed force ruling council ( nigeria ) and became military president and commander in chief of the armed force . in 1986 , he established the nigerian political bureau of 1986 which made recommendation for the transition to the third nigerian republic . in 1989 , babangida started making plan for the transition to the third nigerian republic . he legalized the formation of political party , and formed the two-party system with the social democratic party ( nigeria ) ( sdp ) and national republican convention ( nrc ) ahead of the 1992 nigerian parliamentary election . he urged all nigerian to join either of the party , which the late chief bola ige famously referred to a `` two leper hand . '' the two-party state had been a political bureau recommendation . in november 1991 , after a census wa conducted , the independent national electoral commission ( nec ) announced on 24 january 1992 that both 1992 nigerian parliamentary election to a bicameral national assembly ( nigeria ) and a presidential election would be held later that year . a process of voting wa adopted , referred to a option a4 . this process advocated that any candidate needed to pas through adoption for all elective position from the local government , state government and federal government .
babangida survived the 1990 nigerian coup d'tat attempt , then postponed a promised return to democracy to 1992 . the 1993 nigerian presidential election held on june 12 , the first since the military coup of 1983 . the result though not officially declared by the national electoral commission  showed the duo of moshood abiola and baba gana kingibe of the social democratic party ( nigeria ) ( sdp ) defeated bashir tofa and sylvester ugoh of the national republican convention ( nrc ) by over 2.3 ; million vote . however , babangida annulled the election , leading to massive civilian protest that effectively shut down the country for week . in august 1993 , babangida finally kept his promise to relinquish power to a civilian government , but not before appointing ernest shonekan head of the cabinet of ernest shonekan . babangida 's regime ha been considered the most corrupt , and responsible for creating a culture of corruption in nigeria .
in late 1993 , shonekan 's interim government , the shortest in the political history of the country wa overthrown in the 1993 military coup d'tat led by general sani abacha , who used military force on a wide scale to suppress the continuing civilian unrest . in 1995 the government hanged environmentalist ken saro-wiwa on trumped-up charge in the death of four ogoni elder . lawsuit under the american alien tort statute against royal dutch shell and brian anderson , the head of shell 's nigerian operation , settled out of court with shell continuing to deny liability . several hundred million dollar in account traced to abacha were discovered in 1999 . the regime came to an end in 1998 , when the dictator died in the villa . he looted money to offshore account in western european bank and defeated coup plot by arresting and bribing general and politician . his successor , general abdulsalami abubakar , adopted a new constitution on 5 may 1999 which provided for multiparty election .

on 29 may 1999 , abubakar transferred power to the winner of the 1999 nigerian presidential election , former military ruler general olusegun obasanjo a the second democratically elected civilian president of nigeria heralding the beginning of the fourth nigerian republic . this ended almost 33 year of nigerian military junta of 196679 and 198399 , excluding the short-lived second nigerian republic ( between 1979 and 1983 ) by military dictator who seized power in coup d'tat coup d'tat and counter-coups during the nigerian military junta of 196679 and 198399 nigerian military junta of 19661979 and 19831999 .
although the election that brought obasanjo to power in the 1999 nigerian presidential election and for a second term in the 2003 nigerian presidential election were condemned a unfree and unfair , nigeria ha shown marked improvement in attempt to tackle government corruption and hasten development . conflict in the niger delta ethnic violence for control over the oil-producing niger delta region and an boko haram insurgency insurgency in the north-east are some of the issue facing the country . umaru yar'adua of the people 's democratic party ( nigeria ) people 's democratic party came into power in the nigerian general election , 2007 . the international community , which had been observing nigerian election to encourage a free and fair process , condemned this one a being severely flawed . the then-president , olusegun obasanjo , acknowledged fraud and other electoral `` lapse '' but said the result reflected opinion poll . in a national television address in 2007 , he added that if nigerian did not like the victory of his handpicked successor , they would have an opportunity to vote again in four year . yar'adua died on 5 may 2010. ; goodluck jonathan wa sworn in a yar'adua 's successor , becoming the 14th head of state . goodluck jonathan served a acting president of nigeria until 16 april 2011 , when a new nigerian presidential election , 2011 wa conducted . he went on to win the election , with the international medium reporting the election a having run smoothly with relatively little violence or voter fraud , in contrast to previous election .

<section_title_start>  politics  <section_title_end>
nigeria is a federation republic presidential system , with executive power exercised by the president of nigeria . it is influenced by the westminster system model in the composition and management of the upper and lower house of the bicameral legislature . the president is both [ of state ] and head of government ; the leader is direct election to a maximum of two four-year term . the president 's power is checked by a nigerian senate and a house of representative of nigeria , which are combined in a bicameralism called the national assembly of nigeria . the senate is a 109-seat body with three member from each state and one from the capital region of abuja ; member are elected by popular vote to four-year term . the house contains 360 seat , with the number of seat per state determined by population .
ethnocentrism , tribalism , religious persecution , and prebendalism have plagued nigerian politics both prior and subsequent to independence in 1960 . all major party have practised vote-rigging and other mean of coercion to remain competitive . in the period before 1983 election , a report of expert prepared by the national institute of policy and strategic study showed that only the 1959 and 1979 election were held without systematic rigging . in 2012 , nigeria wa estimated to have lost over $ 400 ; billion to corruption in nigeria since independence . kin-selective altruism ha made it way into nigerian politics , resulting in tribalist effort to concentrate federal power to a particular region of their interest through .
hausa-fulani , yoruba people and igbo people are the three largest ethnic group in nigeria and have maintained historical preeminence in nigerian politics ; competition amongst these three group ha fueled animosity . following the bloody civil war , nationalism ha seen an increase in the southern part of the country leading to active secessionist movement such a the oodua people congress ( opc ) and the movement for the actualization of the sovereign state of biafra ( massob ) , though these group are largely small and not representative of the entire ethnic group .
because of the above issue , nigeria 's political party are pan-nationalism pan-national and secular in character ( though this doe not preclude the continuing preeminence of the dominant ethnicity ) . the two major political party are the people 's democratic party ( nigeria ) people 's democratic party of nigeria and the all progressive congress with twenty minor opposition party are registered . a in many other african society , prebendalism and high rate of corruption continue to constitute major challenge to nigeria .

upon gaining independence in 1960 , nigeria made african unity the centerpiece of it foreign policy and played a leading role in the fight against the apartheid government in south africa . one exception to the african focus wa nigeria 's close relationship developed with israel throughout the 1960s . the latter nation sponsored and oversaw the construction of nigeria 's parliament building .
nigeria 's foreign policy wa put to the test in the 1970s after the country emerged united from it own civil war . it supported movement against white minority government in the southern africa sub-region . nigeria backed the african national congress ( anc ) by taking a committed tough line with regard to the south african government and their military action in southern africa . nigeria wa also a founding member of the organisation for african unity ( now the african union ) , and ha tremendous influence in west africa and africa on the whole . nigeria ha additionally founded regional cooperative effort in west africa , functioning a standard-bearer for the economic community of west african state ( ecowas ) and ecomog , economic and military organization , respectively .
with this africa-centered stance , nigeria readily sent troop to the congo crisis at the behest of the united nation shortly after independence ( and ha maintained membership since that time ) . nigeria also supported several pan-african and pro-self government cause in the 1970s , including garnering support for angola 's popular movement for the liberation of angola , swapo in namibia , and aiding opposition to the minority government of mozambican war of independence , and rhodesian bush war .
nigeria retains membership in the non-aligned movement . in late november 2006 , it organised an africa-south america summit in abuja to promote what some attendee termed `` south-south '' linkage on a variety of front . nigeria is also a member of the international criminal court , and the commonwealth of nation . it wa temporarily expelled from the latter in 1995 when ruled by the sani abacha .
nigeria ha remained a key player in the petroleum industry since the 1970s , and maintains membership in organization of the petroleum exporting country ( opec ) , which it joined in july 1971 . it petroleum in nigeria figure prominently in it sometimes volatile international relation with developed country , notably the united state , and with developing country .
million of nigerian have emigrated during time of economic hardship , primarily to europe , north america and australia . it is estimated that over a million nigerian have emigrated to the united state and constitute the nigerian american populace . individual in many such diasporic community have joined the `` egbe omo yoruba '' society , a national association of yoruba descendant in north america .
in july 2019 , un ambassador of 37 country , including nigeria , have signed a joint letter to the unhrc defending china 's xinjiang re-education camp in the xinjiang region .
since 2000 , sino-nigerian relation sino-nigerian trade relation have risen exponentially . there ha been an increase in total trade of over 10,384 ; million dollar between the two nation from 2000 to 2016 . however the structure of the sino-nigerian trade relationship ha become a major political issue for the nigerian state . this is illustrated by the fact that chinese export account for around 80 percent of total bilateral trade volume . this ha resulted in a serious trade imbalance , with nigeria importing ten time more than it export to china . subsequently , nigeria 's economy is becoming over-reliant on cheap foreign import to sustain itself , resulting in a clear decline in nigerian industry under such arrangement .
continuing it africa-centered foreign policy , nigeria introduced the idea of a single currency for west africa known a the eco ( currency ) under the presumption that it would be led by the naira , but on december 21 , 2019 ; list of head of state of ivory coast alassane ouattara along with emmanuel macron multiple other economic community of west african state state , announced that they would merely rename the cfa franc ( the current currency of the uemoa state ) instead of completely replacing the currency a originally intended . this caused controversy ecowas , citing neocolonialism france co-opting african unity and if ratified , would lead to a loss of sovereignty . a of 2020 , the eco currency ha been delayed to 2025.
<section_title_start>  administrative division  <section_title_end>
nigeria is divided into state of nigeria thirty-six state and one federal capital territory , nigeria , which are further sub-divided into 774 local government area in nigeria . in some context , the list of nigerian state by population are aggregated into geopolitical zone of nigeria : north west ( nigeria ) , north east ( nigeria ) , north central , nigeria , south west ( nigeria ) , south east ( nigeria ) , and south south ( nigeria ) . the constituent state of the six geo-political zone are a follows :
south-west : lagos , ekiti , ogun , ondo , osun , oyo ;
south-south : akwa-ibom , bayelsa , cross river , delta , edo , river ;
south-east : abia , anambra , ebonyi , enugu , imo ;

nigeria ha five city with a population of over a million ( from largest to smallest ) : lagos , kano , ibadan , benin city and port harcourt . lagos is the list of most populous city in africa , with a population of over list of metropolitan area by population in it urban area .
<section_title_start>  geography  <section_title_end>
nigeria is located in western africa on the gulf of guinea and ha a total area of , making it the world 's list of country and dependency by area 32nd-largest country . it is comparable in size to venezuela , and is about twice the size of the u.s. state of california . it border span , and it share border with benin ( ) , niger ( ) , chad ( ) , and cameroon ( including the separatist ambazonia ) . it coastline is at least . nigeria lie between latitude 4th parallel north 4 and 14th parallel north 14n , and longitude 2nd meridian east 2 and 15th meridian east 15e .
the highest point in nigeria is chappal waddi at . the main river are the niger river and the benue river , which converge and empty into the niger delta . this is one of the world 's largest river delta , and the location of a large area of central african mangrove .
<section_title_start>  climate  <section_title_end>
nigeria ha a varied landscape . the far south is defined by it tropical rainforest climate , where annual rainfall is a year . in the southeast stand the obudu plateau . coastal plain are found in both the southwest and the southeast . this forest zone 's most southerly portion is defined a `` salt water swamp '' , also known a a mangrove swamp because of the large amount of mangrove in the area . north of this is fresh water swamp , containing different vegetation from the salt water swamp , and north of that is rainforest .
nigeria 's most expansive topographical region is that of the valley of the niger and benue river valley ( which merge and form a y-shape ) . to the southwest of the niger is `` rugged '' highland ( geography ) . to the southeast of the benue are hill and mountain , which form the mambilla plateau , the highest plateau in nigeria . this plateau extends through the border with cameroon , where the montane land is part of the bamenda highland of cameroon .
the area near the border with cameroon close to the coast is rich rainforest and part of the cross-sanaga-bioko coastal forest ecoregion , an important centre for biodiversity . it is habitat for the drill ( mammal ) , which is found in the wild only in this area and across the border in cameroon . the area surrounding calabar , cross river state , also in this forest , are believed to contain the world 's largest diversity of butterfly . the area of southern nigeria between the river niger and the cross river ( nigeria ) ha lost most of it forest because of development and harvesting by increased population , with it being replaced by grassland ( see cross-niger transition forest ) .
everything in between the far south and the far north is savannah ( insignificant tree cover , with grass and flower located between tree ) . rainfall is more limited , to between per year . the savannah zone 's three category are guinean forest-savanna mosaic , sudan savannah , and sahel savannah . guinean forest-savanna mosaic is plain of tall grass interrupted by tree . sudan savannah is similar but with shorter grass and shorter tree . sahel savannah consists of patch of grass and sand , found in the northeast . in the sahel region , rain is le than per year and the sahara desert is encroaching . in the dry northeast corner of the country lie lake chad , which nigeria share with niger , chad and cameroon .
<section_title_start>  plant ecology  <section_title_end>
nigeria is greatly endowed with numerous tree specie of which the majority of them are native while few are exotic . report show that high percentage of man-made forest in the country is dominated with exotic specie . this culminated from the assumption that exotic tree are fast-growing . however , study have also investigated the growth of indigenous tree in with that of exotic specie .
many country in africa are affected by invasive alien specie ( ia ) . in 2004 , the iucnworld conservation union identified 81 ia in south africa , 49 in mauritius , 37 in algeria and madagascar , 35 in kenya , 28 in egypt , 26 in ghana and zimbabwe , and 22 in ethiopia . however , very little is known about ia in nigeria , with most technical report and literature reporting fewer than 10 invasive plant in the country . aside from plant invader , black rat and avian influenza virus were also considered ia in nigeria . the initial entry of ia into nigeria wa mainly through exotic plant introduction by the colonial ruler either for forest tree plantation or for ornamental purpose . the entry of exotic plant into nigeria during the post-independence era wa encouraged by increasing economic activity , the commencement of commercial oil exploration , introduction through ship , and introduction of ornamental plant by commercial floriculturists .
due to overexploitation , the remaining natural ecosystem and primary forest in nigeria are restricted to the protected area which include one biosphere reserve , seven national park , one world heritage site , 12 strict nature reserve ( snrs ) , 32 game reserves/wildlife sanctuary , and hundred of forest reserve . these are in addition to several ex-situ conservation site such a arboretum , botanical garden , zoological garden , and gene bank managed by several tertiary and research institution
in the semi-arid and dry sub-humid savanna 's of west africa , including nigeria , numerous specie of herbaceous dicot especially from the genus crotalaria , alysicarpus , cassia and ipomoea are known to be widely used in livestock production . quite often they are plucked or cut , and fed either a fresh or conserved fodder . the utilization of these and many other herb growing naturally within the farm environment is opportunistic .
many other specie native to nigeria , including soybean and it variety , serve a an important source of oil and protein in this region . there are also many plant with medicinal purpose that are used to aid the therapy in many organ . some of these vegetation include , euphorbiaceae , that serve purposed to aid malaria , gastrointestinal disorder and many other infection . different stress factor such a drought , low soil nutrient and susceptibility to pest ha contributed to maize plantation being an integral part of agriculture in this region .
a industrialization ha increased , it ha also put specie of tree in the forest at risk to air pollution and study have shown that in certain part of nigeria , tree have shown tolerance and grow in area that have a significant amount air pollution
<section_title_start>  environmental issue  <section_title_end>
nigeria 's delta region , home of the large petroleum in nigeria , experience serious oil spill and other environmental problem , which ha caused conflict in the niger delta .
waste management including sewage treatment , the linked process of deforestation and soil degradation , and climate change or global warming are the major environmental problem in nigeria . waste management present problem in a mega city like lagos and other major nigerian city which are linked with economic development , population growth and the inability of municipal council to manage the resulting rise in industrial and domestic waste . this huge waste management problem is also attributable to unsustainable environmental management lifestyle of kubwa , abuja community in the federal capital territory , where there are habit of indiscriminate disposal of waste , dumping of waste along or into the canal , sewerage system that are channel for water flow , and the like .
haphazard industrial planning , increased urbanisation , poverty and lack of competence of the municipal government are seen a the major reason for high level of waste pollution in major city of the country . some of the 'solutions ' have been disastrous to the environment , resulting in untreated waste being dumped in place where it can pollute waterway and groundwater in nigeria .
in 2005 nigeria had the highest rate of deforestation in the world , according to the food and agriculture organization of the united nation ( fao ) . that year , 12.2 % , the equivalent of 11,089,000 hectare had been forested in the country . between 1990 and 2000 , nigeria lost an average of 409,700 hectare of forest every year equal to an average annual deforestation rate of 2.4 % . between 1990 and 2005 , in total nigeria lost 35.7 % of it forest cover , or around 6,145,000 hectare . nigeria had a 2019 forest landscape integrity index mean score of 6.2/10 , ranking it 82nd globally out of 172 country .
in 2010 , thousand of people were inadvertently exposed to lead-containing soil / ore from informal gold mining within the northern state of zamfara state lead poisoning epidemic . while estimate vary , it is thought that upwards of 400 child died of acute lead poisoning , making this perhaps the largest lead poisoning fatality epidemic ever encountered . a of 2016 , effort to manage the exposure are ongoing .
<section_title_start>  economy  <section_title_end>

nigeria wa ranked 21st in the world in term of list of country by gdp ( ppp ) gdp ( ppp ) in 2015 . nigeria is the united state ' largest trading partner in sub-saharan africa and supply a fifth of it oil ( 11 % of oil import ) . it ha the seventh-largest trade surplus with the u.s. of any country worldwide . nigeria is the 50th-largest export market for u.s. good and the 14th-largest exporter of good to the u.s . the united state is the country 's largest foreign investor . following the oil price collapse in 20142016 , combined with negative production shock , the gross domestic product ( gdp ) growth rate dropped to 2.7 % in 2015 . in 2016 during it first recession in 25 year , the economy contracted by 1.6 % . fiscal year 2016 wa characterized by currency depreciation and the attendant higher price of petroleum product , electricity , and imported food pushed inflation to 18.55 % in december 2016 from 9.55 % in december 2015.
in 2019 , the economy began to recover slightly with the nation 's real gdp growing by 2.3 % and the imf estimating another increase of 2.3 % in 2020.
economic development ha been hindered by year of military dictatorship , corruption , and mismanagement . the restoration of democracy and subsequent economic reform have successfully put nigeria back on track towards achieving it full economic potential . it is the largest economy in africa , having overtaken south africa . next to petrodollars , the second-biggest source of foreign exchange earnings for nigeria are remittance sent home by nigerian living abroad .
during the opec of the 1970s , nigeria accumulated a significant foreign debt to finance major infrastructural investment . with the fall of oil price during the 1980s oil glut nigeria struggled to keep up with it loan payment and eventually defaulted on it principal debt repayment , limiting repayment to the interest portion of the loan . arrears and penalty interest accumulated on the unpaid principal , which increased the size of the debt . after negotiation by the nigerian authority , in october 2005 nigeria and it paris club creditor reached an agreement under which nigeria repurchased it debt at a discount of approximately 60 % . nigeria used part of it oil profit to pay the residual 40 % , freeing up at least $ 1.15 ; billion annually for poverty reduction programme . nigeria made history in april 2006 by becoming the first african country to completely pay off it debt ( estimated $ 30 ; billion ) owed to the paris club .
nigeria is trying to reach the sustainable development goal 1 , which is to ending poverty in all it form everywhere in all it form by 2030.

prior to the nigerian civil war , nigeria wa self-sufficient in food . agriculture ha failed to keep pace with nigeria 's rapid population growth , and nigeria now relies upon food import to sustain itself . the nigerian government promoted the use of inorganic fertilizer in the 1970s . in august 2019 , nigeria closed it border with benin to stop rice smuggling into the country a part of effort to boost the local production .
<section_title_start>  petroleum and mining  <section_title_end>
nigeria is the 12th largest producer of petroleum in the world and the 8th largest exporter , and ha the 10th largest proven reserve . ( the country joined opec in 1971 . ) petroleum in nigeria play a large role in the nigerian economy , accounting for 40 % of gdp and 80 % of government earnings . however , agitation for better resource control in the niger delta , it main oil-producing region , ha led to disruption in oil production and prevents the country from exporting at 100 % capacity .
the niger delta nembe creek oil field wa discovered in 1973 and produce from middle miocene river delta sandstone-shale in an anticline structural trap at a depth of . in june 2013 , shell announced a strategic review of it operation in nigeria , hinting that asset could be divested . while many international oil company have operated there for decade , by 2014 most were making move to divest their interest , citing a range of issue including oil theft . in august 2014 , shell oil company said it wa finalising it interest in four nigerian oil field .
nigeria ha a total of 159 oil field and 1,481 oil well in operation according to the department of petroleum resource . the most productive region of the nation is the coastal niger delta field in the niger delta or `` south-south '' region which encompasses 78 of the 159 oil field . most of nigeria 's oil field are small and scattered , and a of 1990 , these small field accounted for 62.1 % of all nigerian production . this contrast with the sixteen largest field which produced 37.9 % of nigeria 's petroleum at that time .
in addition to it petroleum resource , nigeria also ha a wide array of underexploited mineral resource which include natural gas , coal , bauxite , tantalite , gold , tin , iron ore , limestone , niobium , lead and zinc . despite huge deposit of these natural resource , the mining industry in nigeria is still in it infancy .

<section_title_start> pre-columbian era <section_title_end>
before the arrival of the spanish , cuba wa inhabited by two distinct tribe of indigenous people of the america : the tano ( including the ciboney people ) , and the guanahatabey .
the ancestor of the tano migrated from the mainland of south america , with the earliest site dated to 5,000 before present .
the tano arrived from hispaniola sometime in the 3rd century a.d . when columbus arrived , they were the dominant culture in cuba , having an estimated population of 150,000 . it is unknown when or how the guanahatabey arrived in cuba , having both a different language and culture than the tano ; it is inferred that they were a relict ( biology ) of pre-tano settler of the greater antilles .
the tano were farmer , a well a fisher and [
<section_title_start> spanish colonization and rule ( 14921898 )  <section_title_end>
after first landing on an island then called guanahani ] , [ [ the bahamas , on 12 october 1492 , christopher columbus commanded his three ship : pinta ( ship ) , la nia and the santa mara ( ship ) , discovering cuba on 27 october 1492 , and landed in northeastern coast on october 28 . ( this wa near what is now bariay , holgun province . ) columbus claimed the island for the new habsburg spain and named it isla juana after john , prince of asturias .
in 1511 , the first spanish colonization of the america wa founded by diego velzquez de cullar at baracoa . other settlement soon followed , including havana , founded in 1515 , which later became the capital . the indigenous people of the america tano were forced to work under the encomienda system , which resembled the feudalism in medieval europe . within a century , the indigenous people were virtually wiped out due to multiple factor , primarily eurasian infection , to which they had no natural resistance ( immunity ) , aggravated by harsh condition of the repressive colonial subjugation . in 1529 , a measles outbreak in cuba killed two-thirds of those few native who had previously survived smallpox .
on 18 may 1539 , conquistador hernando de soto departed from havana with some 600 follower into a vast expedition through the southeastern united state , starting at what is now spanish florida , in search of gold , treasure , fame and power . on 1 september 1548 , dr. gonzalo perez de angulo wa appointed governor of cuba . he arrived in santiago , cuba , on 4 november 1549 , and immediately declared the liberty of all native . he became cuba 's first permanent governor to reside in havana instead of santiago , and he built havana 's first church made of masonry . after the kingdom of france captured havana in 1555 , the governor 's son , francisco de angulo , went to the new spain .
cuba developed slowly and , unlike the plantation island of the caribbean , had a diversified agriculture . most importantly , the colony developed a an urbanized society that primarily supported the spanish colonial empire . by the mid-18th century , there were 50,000 slave on the island , compared to 60,000 in barbados and 300,000 in colony of virginia ; a well a 450,000 in saint-domingue , all of which had large-scale sugarcane plantation .
the seven year ' war , which erupted in 1754 across three continent , eventually arrived in the spanish west indie # spanish caribbean . spain 's pacte de famille pitched them into anglo-spanish war ( 176263 ) with the kingdom of great britain , and in 1762 , siege of havana consisting of dozen of ship and thousand of troop set out from portsmouth to capture cuba . the british arrived on 6 june , and by august , had placed havana under siege . when havana surrendered , the admiral of the british fleet , george pocock and the commander of the land force george keppel , 3rd earl of albemarle , the 3rd earl of albemarle , entered the city , and took control of the western part of the island . the british immediately opened up trade with their british america and caribbean colony , causing a rapid transformation of cuban society .
though havana , which had become the third-largest city in the america , wa to enter an era of sustained development and increasing tie with north america during this period , the british occupation of the city proved short-lived . pressure from london to sugar merchant , fearing a decline in sugar price , forced negotiation with the spanish over the captured territory . le than a year after britain captured havana , it signed the treaty of paris ( 1763 ) together with france and spain , ending the seven year ' war . the treaty gave britain florida in exchange for cuba . the french had recommended this to spain , advising that declining to give up spanish florida could result in spain instead losing new spain and much of their colony on south american mainland in the future . many in britain were disappointed , believing that florida wa a poor return for cuba and great britain in the seven year ' war britain 's other gain in the war .
the largest factor for the growth of cuba 's commerce in the late eighteenth and early nineteenth century wa the haitian revolution . when the enslaved people of what had been the caribbean 's richest colony freed themselves through violent revolt , cuban planter perceived the region 's changing circumstance with both a sense of fear and opportunity . they were afraid because of the prospect that slave might revolt in cuba a well , and numerous prohibition during the 1790s on the sale of slave in cuba that had previously been slave in french colony underscored this anxiety . the planter saw opportunity , however , because they thought that they could exploit the situation by transforming cuba into the slave society and sugar-producing `` pearl of the antilles '' that haiti had been before the revolution . a the historian ada ferrer ha written , `` at a basic level , liberation in saint-domingue helped entrench it denial in cuba . a slavery and colonialism collapsed in the french colony , the spanish island underwent transformation that were almost the mirror image of haiti 's . '' estimate suggest that between 1790 and 1820 some 325,000 african were imported to cuba a slave , which wa four time the amount that had arrived between 1760 and 1790.
although a smaller proportion of the population of cuba wa enslaved , at time , slave arose in revolt . in 1812 , the aponte conspiracy took place , but it wa ultimately suppressed .
the population of cuba in 1817 wa 630,980 ( of which 291,021 were white , 115,691 were free people of color ( mixed-race ) , and 224,268 black slave ) . this wa a much higher proportion of free black to slave than in virginia , for instance , or the other caribbean island . historian such a magnus mrner , who have studied slavery in latin america , found that manumission increased when slave economy were in decline , a in 18th-century cuba and early 19th-century maryland in the united state .
in part due to cuban slave working primarily in urbanized setting , by the 19th century , the practice of coartacion had developed ( or `` buying oneself out of slavery '' , a `` uniquely cuban development '' ) , according to historian herbert s. klein . due to a shortage of white labor , black dominated urban industry `` to such an extent that when white in large number came to cuba in the middle of the nineteenth century , they were unable to displace negro worker . '' a system of diversified agriculture , with small farm and fewer slave , served to supply the city with produce and other good .
in the 1820s , when the rest of spain 's empire in latin america decolonization of the america , cuba remained loyal to spain . it economy wa based on serving the empire . by 1860 , cuba had 213,167 free people of color ( 39 % of it non-white population of 550,000 ) . by contrast , virginia , with about the same number of black , had only 58,042 or 11 % who were free ; the rest were enslaved .
<section_title_start> independence movements <section_title_end>
full independence from spain wa the goal of a rebellion in 1868 led by planter carlos manuel de cspedes . de cspedes , a sugar planter , freed his slave to fight with him for an independent cuba . on 27 december 1868 , he issued a decree condemning slavery in theory but accepting it in practice and declaring free any slave whose master present them for military service . the 1868 rebellion resulted in a prolonged conflict known a the ten year ' war . a great number of the rebel were volunteer from puerto rico , the dominican republic , mexico , and the united state , a well a numerous chinese cuban indentured servitude . a battalion of 500 chinese fought under the command of general mximo gmez in the 1874 battle of la guasimas . a monument in havana honor the cuban chinese who fell in the war .
a group of dominican exile , led by mximo gmez , luis marcano , and modesto daz , utilizing the experience they had gained in the dominican restoration war ( 186365 ) , became instructor of military strategy and tactic . with reinforcement and guidance from the dominican , the cuban defeated spanish detachment , cut railway line , and gained dominance over vast section of the eastern portion of the island . on 19 february 1874 , gmez and 700 other rebel marched westward from their eastern base and defeated 2,000 spanish troop at el naranjo . the spaniard lost 100 killed and 200 wounded and the rebel a total of 150 killed and wounded . the most significant rebel victory came at the battle of la guasimas , 1620 march 1874 , when 2,050 rebel , led by antonio maceo grajales and gmez , defeated 5,000 spanish troop with 6 cannon . the five-day battle cost the spanish 1,037 casualty and the rebel 174 casualty .
the united state declined to recognize the new cuban government , although many european and latin american nation did so . in 1878 , the pact of zanjn ended the conflict , with spain promising greater autonomy to cuba . spain sustained 200,000 casualty , mostly from disease ; the rebel sustained 100,000150,000 dead . in 187980 , cuban patriot calixto garca attempted to start another war known a the little war ( cuba ) but failed to receive enough support . slavery in cuba wa abolished in 1875 but the process wa completed only in 1886.
an exiled dissident named jos mart founded the cuban revolutionary party in new york city in 1892 . the aim of the party wa to achieve cuban independence from spain . in january 1895 mart traveled to san fernando de monte cristi and santo domingo in the dominican republic to join the effort of mximo gmez . mart recorded his political view in the manifesto of montecristi . fighting against the spanish army began in cuba on 24 february 1895 , but mart wa unable to reach cuba until 11 april 1895 . mart wa killed in the battle of do rio on 19 may 1895 . his death immortalized him a cuba 's national hero .
around 200,000 spanish troop outnumbered the much smaller rebel army , which relied mostly on guerilla warfare and sabotage tactic . the spaniard began a campaign of suppression . general valeriano weyler , the military governor of cuba , herded the rural population into what he called reconcentrados , described by international observer a `` fortified town '' . these are often considered the prototype for 20th-century internment . between 200,000 and 400,000 cuban civilian died from starvation and disease in the spanish concentration camp , number verified by the red cross and united state senate redfield proctor , a former united state secretary of war . american and european protest against spanish conduct on the island followed .
the u.s. pre-dreadnought battleship us maine ( 1889 ) wa sent to protect american interest , but soon after arrival , it exploded in havana harbor and sank quickly , killing nearly three-quarters of the crew . the cause and responsibility for the sinking of the ship remained unclear after a board of inquiry . popular opinion in the u.s. , fueled by an yellow press , concluded that the spanish were to blame and demanded action . spain and the united state declared war on each other in late april 1898 . over the previous decade , five u.s. presidentsjames k. polk , franklin pierce , james buchanan , ulysses s. grant , and william mckinleyhad tried to buy the island of cuba from spain .
the battle of santiago de cuba , on 3 july 1898 , wa the largest naval engagement during the spanishamerican war , and resulted in the destruction of the spanish caribbean squadron . resistance in santiago consolidated around fort canosa , while major battle between spaniard and american took place at battle of la guasimas on 24 june , and at battle of el caney and battle of san juan hill on 1 july , after which the american advance ground to a halt . the american lost 81 killed and 360 wounded in taking el caney , where the spanish defender lost 38 killed , 138 wounded and 160 captured . at san juan , the american lost 216 killed and 1,024 wounded ; spanish loss were 58 killed , 170 wounded and 39 captured . spanish troop successfully defended fort canosa , allowing them to stabilize their line and bar the entry to santiago . the american and cuban began a brutal siege of the city , which surrendered on 16 july after the defeat of the spanish caribbean squadron .
spain had sacrificed more of it son to hold on to cuba than she had in attempting to cling on to spanish american war of independence , and suffered over 62,000 dead in the cuban war of independence 189598 war .

<section_title_start>  first year ( 19021925 )  <section_title_end>
after the spanishamerican war , spain and the united state signed the treaty of paris ( 1898 ) , by which spain ceded puerto rico , the philippine , and guam to the united state for the sum of and cuba became a protectorate of the united state . cuba gained formal independence from the u.s. on 20 may 1902 , a the republic of cuba . under cuba 's new constitution , the u.s. retained the right to intervene in cuban affair and to supervise it finance and foreign relation . under the platt amendment , the u.s. leased the guantnamo bay naval base from cuba .
following disputed election in 1906 , the first president , tom estrada palma , faced an armed revolt by independence war veteran who defeated the meager government force . the u.s. intervened by occupying cuba and named charles edward magoon a governor for three year . cuban historian have characterized magoon 's governorship a having introduced political and social corruption . in 1908 , self-government wa restored when jos miguel gmez wa elected president , but the u.s. continued intervening in cuban affair . in 1912 , the partido independiente de color attempted to establish a separate black republic in oriente province , but wa suppressed by general monteagudo with considerable bloodshed .
in 1924 , gerardo machado wa elected president . during his administration , tourism increased markedly , and american-owned hotel and restaurant were built to accommodate the influx of tourist . the tourist boom led to increase in gambling and prostitution in cuba . the wall street crash of 1929 led to a collapse in the price of sugar , political unrest , and repression . protesting student , known a the generation of 1930 , turned to violence in opposition to the increasingly unpopular machado . a general strike ( in which the communist party sided with machado ) , uprising among sugar worker , and an army revolt forced machado into exile in august 1933 . he wa replaced by carlos manuel de cspedes y quesada .
<section_title_start>  revolution of 19331940 <section_title_end>
in september 1933 , the sergeant ' revolt , led by sergeant fulgencio batista , overthrew cspedes . a five-member executive committee ( the pentarchy of 1933 ) wa chosen to head a provisional government . ramn grau san martn wa then appointed a provisional president . grau resigned in 1934 , leaving the way clear for batista , who dominated cuban politics for the next 25 year , at first through a series of puppet-presidents . the period from 1933 to 1937 wa a time of `` virtually unremitting social and political warfare '' . on balance , during the period 19331940 cuba suffered from fragile politic structure , reflected in the fact that it saw three different president in two year ( 19351936 ) , and in the militaristic and repressive policy of batista a head of the army .
<section_title_start>  constitution of 1940  <section_title_end>
a 1940 constitution of cuba wa adopted in 1940 , which engineered radical progressive idea , including the right to labor and health care . batista wa elected president in the same year , holding the post until 1944 . he is so far the only non-white cuban to win the nation 's highest political office . his government carried out major social reform . several member of the communist party held office under his administration . cuban armed force were not greatly involved in combat during world war ; iithough president batista did suggest a joint u.s.-latin american assault on spanish state to overthrow it authoritarian regime . cuba lost 6 merchant ship during the war , and the cuban navy wa credited with sinking the .
batista adhered to the 1940 constitution 's stricture preventing his re-election . ramon grau san martin wa the winner of the next election , in 1944 . grau further corroded the base of the already teetering legitimacy of the cuban political system , in particular by undermining the deeply flawed , though not entirely ineffectual , congress and supreme court . carlos pro socarrs , a protg of grau , became president in 1948 . the two term of the autntico party brought an influx of investment , which fueled an economic boom , raised living standard for all segment of society , and created a middle class in most urban area .
after finishing his term in 1944 batista lived in florida , returning to cuba to run for president in 1952 . facing certain electoral defeat , he led a 1952 cuban coup d'tat that preempted the election . back in power , and receiving financial , military , and logistical support from the united state government , batista suspended the 1940 constitution and revoked most political liberty , including the right to strike . he then aligned with the wealthiest landowner who owned the largest sugar plantation , and presided over a stagnating economy that widened the gap between rich and poor cuban . batista outlawed the cuban communist party in 1952 . after the coup , cuba had latin america 's highest per caput consumption rate of meat , vegetable , cereal , automobile , telephone and radio , though about one-third of the population wa considered poor and enjoyed relatively little of this consumption .
in 1958 , cuba wa a relatively well-advanced country by latin american standard , and in some case by world standard . cuba wa also affected by perhaps the largest labor union privilege in latin america , including ban on dismissal and mechanization . they were obtained in large measure `` at the cost of the unemployed and the peasant '' , leading to disparity . between 1933 and 1958 , cuba extended economic regulation enormously , causing economic problem . unemployment became a problem a graduate entering the workforce could not find job . the middle class , which wa comparable to that of the united state , became increasingly dissatisfied with unemployment and political persecution . the labor union supported batista until the very end . batista stayed in power until he wa forced into exile in december 1958.
<section_title_start> revolution and communist party rule ( 1959present )  <section_title_end>
in the 1950s , various organization , including some advocating armed uprising , competed for public support in bringing about political change . in 1956 , fidel castro and about 80 supporter landed from the yacht granma ( yacht ) in an attempt to start a rebellion against the batista government . it wa not until 1958 that castro 's july 26th movement emerged a the leading revolutionary group .
by late 1958 the rebel had broken out of the sierra maestra and launched a general popular insurrection . after castro 's fighter captured santa clara , cuba , batista fled with his family to the dominican republic on 1 january 1959 . later he went into exile on the portuguese island of madeira and finally settled in estoril , near lisbon . fidel castro 's force entered the capital on 8 january 1959 . the liberal manuel urrutia lle became the provisional president .
dominican republic strongman ( politics ) rafael trujillo and castro both supported attempt to overthrow each other . on 14 june 1959 , a cuban-supported invasion force landed from an airplane at constanza , dominican republic , only to be immediately massacred . a week later , two yacht offloaded 186 invader onto chris-craft launch for a landing on the north coast . dominican air force pilot fired rocket from their de havilland vampire into the approaching launch , killing all but 30 men , who managed to make it to the beach at maimon and estero hondo . trujillo ordered his son , ramfis trujillo , to lead the hunt for the survivor , and soon they were captured . the leader of the invasion were taken aboard a dominican air force plane and then pushed out in mid-air , falling to their death . militant anti-castro group , funded by exile , by the central intelligence agency ( cia ) and by trujillo 's dominican government , carried out armed attack and set up guerrilla base in cuba 's mountainous region . this led to the six-year escambray rebellion ( 195965 ) , which lasted longer and involved more soldier than the cuban revolution .
the united state department of state ha estimated that 3,200 people were executed from 1959 to 1962 . according to amnesty international , official death sentence from 1959 to 1987 numbered 237 of which all but 21 were actually carried out . other estimate for the total number of political execution go up to a many a 4,000 . the vast majority of those executed directly following the 1959 revolution were policeman , politician , and informer of the batista regime accused of crime such a torture and murder , and their public trial and execution had widespread popular support among the cuban population .
the united state government initially reacted favorably to the cuban revolution , seeing it a part of a movement to bring democracy to latin america . castro 's legalization of the communist party and the hundred of execution of batista agent , policeman and soldier that followed caused a deterioration in the relationship between the two country . the promulgation of the agrarian reform law of cuba , expropriating thousand of acre of farmland ( including from large u.s. landholder ) , further worsened relation . in response , between 1960 and 1964 the u.s. imposed a range of sanction , eventually including a total ban on trade between the country and a freeze on all cuban-owned asset in the u.s . in february 1960 , castro signed a commercial agreement with soviet vice-premier anastas mikoyan .
in march 1960 , u.s. president dwight d. eisenhower gave his approval to a central intelligence agency plan to arm and train a group of cuban refugee to overthrow the castro regime . the invasion ( known a the bay of pig invasion ) took place on 14 april 1961 , during the term of president john f. kennedy . about 1,400 cuban exile disembarked at the bay of pig , but failed in their attempt to overthrow castro . in january 1962 , cuba wa suspended from the organization of american state ( oas ) , and later the same year the oas started to impose sanction against cuba of similar nature to the u.s. sanction . the cuban missile crisis ( october 1962 ) almost sparked world war iii # cuban missile crisis : 1528 october 1962 . by 1963 , cuba wa moving towards a full-fledged communist system modeled on the ussr .
in 1963 , cuba sent 686 troop together with 22 tank and other military equipment to support algeria in the sand war against morocco . in 1964 , cuba organized a meeting of latin american communist in havana and stoked a dominican civil war in 1965 that prompted the u.s. military to intervene there . che guevara engaged in guerrilla activity in democratic republic of the congo and wa killed in 1967 while attempting to start a revolution in bolivia . during the 1970s , fidel castro dispatched ten of thousand of troop in support of soviet-supported war in africa . he supported the popular movement for the liberation of angola in angola and mengistu haile mariam in ethiopia .
in november 1975 , cuba poured more than 65,000 troop and 400 soviet-made tank into angola in one of the fastest military mobilization in history . south africa developed nuclear weapon due to the threat to it security posed by the presence of large number of cuban troop in angola and mozambique . in 1976 and again in 1988 , the cuban defeated apartheid south african force in angola . an estimated 5,000 cuban were killed in action during the angolan civil war . in march 1978 , cuba sent 12,000 regular troop to ethiopia , assisted by mechanized soviet battalion , to help defeat a somali invasion ( see ogaden war ) . the cuban and the russian pushed the somali back to their original border . the presence of a substantial number of black and mulatto in the cuban force ( 4050 percent in angola ) helped give teeth to castro 's campaign against racism and related prejudice like xenophobia .

<section_title_start> prehistory of anatolia and eastern thrace <section_title_end>
the anatolian peninsula , comprising most of modern turkey , is one of the oldest permanently settled region in the world . various ancient anatolian population have lived in anatolia , from at least the neolithic until the hellenistic civilization . many of these people spoke the anatolian language , a branch of the larger indo-european language family : and , given the antiquity of the indo-european hittite language and luwian language language , some scholar have proposed anatolian hypothesis anatolia a the hypothetical centre from which the indo-european language radiated . the european part of turkey , called eastern thrace , ha also been inhabited since at least forty thousand year ago , and is known to have been in the neolithic era by about 6000 bc .
gbekli tepe is the site of the oldest known man-made religious structure , a temple dating to circa 10,000 bc , while atalhyk is a very large neolithic and chalcolithic settlement in southern anatolia , which existed from approximately 7500 bc to 5700 bc . it is the largest and best-preserved neolithic site found to date and is a unesco world heritage site . the settlement of troy started in the neolithic age and continued into the iron age .
the earliest recorded inhabitant of anatolia were the hattians and hurrians , non-indo-european people who inhabited central and eastern anatolia , respectively , a early a c. 2300 bc . indo-european hittite came to anatolia and gradually absorbed the hattians and hurrians c. 20001700 bc . the first major empire in the area wa founded by the hittite , from the 18th through the 13th century bc . the assyrian conquered and settled part of southeastern turkey a early a 1950 bc until the year 612 bc , although they assyrian continuity in the region , namely in hakkari , rnak province and mardin province .
urartu re-emerged in assyrian inscription in the 9th century bc a a powerful northern rival of assyria . following the collapse of the hittite empire c. 1180 bc , the phrygian , an indo-european people , achieved ascendancy in anatolia until their kingdom wa destroyed by the cimmerians in the 7th century bc . starting from 714 bc , urartu shared the same fate and dissolved in 590 bc , when it wa conquered by the medes . the most powerful of phrygia 's successor state were lydia , caria and lycia .
<section_title_start> antiquity <section_title_end>
starting around 1200 bc , the coast of anatolia wa heavily settled by aeolian and ionian ancient greece . numerous important city were founded by these colonist , such a miletus , ephesus , smyrna ( now izmir ) and byzantium ( now istanbul ) , the latter founded by greek colonist from megara in 657 bc . the first state that wa called armenia by neighbouring people wa the state of the armenian orontid dynasty , which included part of eastern turkey beginning in the 6th century bc . in northwest turkey , the most significant tribal group in thrace wa the odrysian kingdom , founded by teres i.
all of modern-day turkey wa conquered by the persian achaemenid empire during the 6th century bc . the greco-persian war started when the greek city state on the coast of anatolia rebelled against persian rule in 499 bc . the territory of turkey later fell to alexander the great in 334 bc , which led to increasing cultural homogeneity and hellenization in the area .
following alexander 's death in 323 bc , anatolia wa subsequently divided into a number of small hellenistic kingdom , all of which became part of the roman republic by the mid-1st century bc . the process of hellenization that began with alexander 's conquest accelerated under roman rule , and by the early century of the christian era , the local anatolian language and culture had become extinct , being largely replaced by ancient greek language and culture . from the 1st century bc up to the 3rd century ce , large part of modern-day turkey were contested between the roman empire and neighbouring parthian empire through the frequent roman-parthian war .
<section_title_start> early christian and byzantine period <section_title_end>
according to act of apostle 11 , antioch ( now antakya ) , a city in southern turkey , is the birthplace of the early christianity .
in 324 , constantine i chose byzantium to be the new capital of the roman empire , renaming it new rome . following the death of theodosius i in 395 and the permanent division of the roman empire between his two son , the city , which would popularly come to be known a constantinople , became the capital of the eastern roman empire . this empire , which would later be branded by historian a the byzantine empire , ruled most of the territory of present-day turkey until the late middle age ; although the eastern region remained firmly in sasanian hand up to the first half of the seventh century . the frequent byzantine-sassanid war , a part of the century long-lasting roman-persian war , fought between the neighbouring rivalling byzantine and sasanians , took place in various part of present-day turkey and decided much of the latter 's history from the fourth century up to the first half of the seventh century .

<section_title_start> seljuks and the ottoman empire <section_title_end>
the seljuq dynasty originated from the knk ( tribe ) branch of the oghuz turk who resided on the periphery of the muslim history # abbasids - `` islamic golden age '' , in the oghuz yabgu state of the ouz confederacy , to the north of the caspian sea and aral sea , in the 9th century . in the 10th century , the seljuk started migrating from their ancestral homeland into persia , which became the administrative core of the seljuk empire , after it foundation by tughril .
in the latter half of the 11th century , the seljuk turk began penetrating into medieval armenia and the eastern region of anatolia . in 1071 , the seljuk defeated the byzantine at the battle of manzikert , starting the turkification process in the area ; the turkish language and islam were introduced to armenia and anatolia , gradually spreading throughout the region . the slow transition from a predominantly christian and greek language-speaking anatolia to a predominantly muslim and turkish-speaking one wa underway . the mevlevi order of dervish , which wa established in konya during the 13th century by sufi poet celaleddin rumi , played a significant role in the islamization of the diverse people of anatolia who had previously been hellenized . thus , alongside the turkification of the territory , the persianate society seljuk set the basis for a turko-persian tradition turko-persian principal culture in anatolia , which their eventual successor , culture of the ottoman empire , would take over .
in 1243 , the seljuk army were defeated by the mongol empire at the battle of kse da , causing the seljuk empire 's power to slowly disintegrate . in it wake , one of the anatolian beyliks governed by osman i would evolve over the next 200 year into the ottoman empire . the ottoman completed their conquest of the byzantine empire by fall of constantinople capturing it capital , constantinople , in 1453 : their commander thenceforth being known a mehmed the conqueror .
in 1514 , sultan selim i ( 15121520 ) successfully expanded the empire 's southern and eastern border by defeating shah ismail i of the safavid dynasty in the battle of chaldiran . in 1517 , selim i expanded ottoman rule into ottoman algeria and ottomanmamluk war ( 15161517 ) , and created a naval presence in the red sea . subsequently , a contest started between the ottoman and portuguese empire empire to become the dominant sea power in the indian ocean , with ottoman naval expedition in the indian ocean in the red sea , the arabian sea and the persian gulf . the portuguese presence in the indian ocean wa perceived a a threat to the ottoman monopoly over the silk road between east asia and western europe . despite the increasingly prominent european presence , the ottoman empire 's trade with the east continued to flourish until the second half of the 18th century .
the ottoman empire 's power and prestige peaked in the 16th and 17th century , particularly during the reign of suleiman the magnificent , who personally instituted major legislative change relating to society , education , taxation and criminal law . the empire wa often at odds with the holy roman empire in it steady advance towards central europe through the balkan and the southern part of the polishlithuanian commonwealth . the ottoman navy contended with several holy league , such a those in holy league ( 1538 ) , holy league ( 1571 ) , holy league ( 1684 ) and holy league ( 1717 ) ( composed primarily of habsburg spain , the republic of genoa , the republic of venice , the knight hospitaller knight of st. john , the papal state , the grand duchy of tuscany and the duchy of savoy ) , for the control of the mediterranean sea . in the east , the ottoman were often at war with safavid persia over conflict stemming from territorial dispute or religious difference between the 16th and 18th century . the ottoman-persian war continued a the zand dynasty , afsharid dynasty , and qajar dynasty dynasty succeeded the safavids in iran , until the ottomanpersian war ( 18211823 ) . even further east , there wa an extension of the habsburg-ottoman conflict , in that the ottoman also had to ottoman expedition to aceh to their farthest and easternmost vassal and territory , the aceh sultanate in southeast asia , to defend it from european colonizer a well a the juan de salcedo who had crossed from latin america and had christianized the formerly muslim-dominated islam in the philippine . from the 16th to the early 20th century , the ottoman empire also russo-turkish war with the tsardom of russia and russian empire . these were initially about ottoman territorial expansion and consolidation in southeastern and eastern europe ; but starting from the russo-turkish war ( 17681774 ) , they became more about the survival of the ottoman empire , which had begun to lose it strategic territory on the northern black sea coast to the advancing russian .
from the second half of the 18th century onwards , the decline of the ottoman empire . the tanzimat reform , initiated by mahmud ii just before his death in 1839 , aimed to modernise the ottoman state in line with the progress that had been made in western europe . the effort of midhat pasha during the late tanzimat era led the ottoman ottoman constitution of 1876 , which introduced the first constitutional era , but these effort proved to be inadequate in most field , and failed to stop the dissolution of the ottoman empire . a the empire gradually shrank in size , military power and wealth ; especially after the great eastern crisis in 1875 which led to uprising in the balkan province that culminated in the russo-turkish war ( 18771878 ) ; many balkan muslim migrated to the empire 's heartland in anatolia , along with the circassian fleeing the russiancircassian war of the russian conquest of the caucasus . the decline of the ottoman empire led to a rise of nationalism under the ottoman empire , leading to increased ethnic tension which occasionally burst into violence , such a the hamidian massacre of armenian .
the loss of rumelia ( ottoman territory in europe ) with the first balkan war ( 19121913 ) wa followed by the arrival of million of muslim refugee ( muhacir ) to istanbul and anatolia . historically , the rumelia eyalet and anatolia eyalet had formed the administrative division of the ottoman empire core of the ottoman empire , with their governor titled beylerbeyi participating in the sultan 's imperial council ( ottoman empire ) , so the loss of all balkan province beyond the kyky-enez border line according to the london conference of 191213 and the treaty of london ( 1913 ) wa a major shock for the ottoman society and led to the 1913 ottoman coup d'tat . in the second balkan war ( 1913 ) the ottoman managed to recover their former capital edirne ( adrianople ) and it surrounding area in east thrace , which wa formalised with the treaty of constantinople ( 1913 ) . the 1913 coup d'tat effectively put the country under the control of the three pasha , making sultan mehmed v and mehmed vi largely symbolic figurehead with no real political power .
the ottoman empire entered world war i on the side of the central power and wa ultimately defeated . the ottoman successfully defended the dardanelles strait during the gallipoli campaign ( 19151916 ) and achieved initial victory against british force in the first two year of the mesopotamian campaign , such a the siege of kut ( 19151916 ) ; but the arab revolt ( 19161918 ) turned the tide against the ottoman in the middle east . in the caucasus campaign , however , the russian force had the upper hand from the beginning , especially after the battle of sarikamish ( 19141915 ) . russian force advanced into northeastern anatolia and controlled the major city there until retreating from world war i with the treaty of brest-litovsk following the russian revolution ( 1917 ) . during the war , the empire 's armenian were tehcir law to syria a part of the armenian genocide . a a result , an estimated 800,000 to 1,500,000 armenian were killed . the turkish government ha armenian genocide denial the event a genocide and state that armenian were only population transfer from the eastern war zone . genocidal campaign were also committed against the empire 's other minority group such a the assyrian genocide and greek genocide . following the armistice of mudros on 30 october 1918 , the victorious ally of world war i sought to partitioning of the ottoman empire through the 1920 treaty of svres .

<section_title_start> history <section_title_end>
the first people known to have inhabited central asia were scythian who came from the northern grassland of what is now uzbekistan , sometime in the first millennium bc ; when these nomad settled in the region they built an extensive irrigation system along the river . at this time , city such a bukhoro ( bukhara ) and samarqand ( samarkand ) emerged a centre of government and high culture . by the fifth century bc , the bactrian , soghdian , and yuezhi state dominated the region .
a east asian country began to develop it silk trade with the west , persian city took advantage of this commerce by becoming centre of trade . using an extensive network of city and rural settlement in the province of transoxiana , and further east in what is today china 's xinjiang uygur autonomous region , the sogdian intermediary became the wealthiest of these iranian merchant . a a result of this trade on what became known a the silk route , bukhara and samarkand eventually became extremely wealthy city , and at time transoxiana ( mawarannahr ) wa one of the most influential and powerful persian province of antiquity .
in 327 bc macedonian ruler alexander the great conquered the achaemenid empire province of sogdiana and bactria , which contained the territory of modern uzbekistan . a conquest wa supposedly of little help to alexander a popular resistance wa fierce , causing alexander 's army to be bogged down in the region that became the northern part of the macedonian greco-bactrian kingdom . the kingdom wa replaced with the yuezhi dominated kushan empire in the 1st century bc . for many century the region of uzbekistan wa ruled by the persian empire , including the parthian empire and sassanid empire , a well a by other empire , for example those formed by the turko-persian hephthalite and turkic gokturk people .
in the 8th century , transoxiana , the territory between the amu darya and syr darya river , wa conquered by the arab ( ali ibn sattor ) becoming a focal point soon after of the islamic golden age . many notable scientist lived there and contributed to it development after the conquest . among the achievement of the scholar during this period were the development of trigonometry into it modern form ( simplifying it practical application to calculate the phase of the moon ) , advance in optic , in astronomy , a well a in poetry , philosophy , art , calligraphy and many others , which set the foundation for the muslim renaissance .
in the 9th and 10th century , transoxiana wa included into the samanid state . later , transoxiana saw the incursion of the turkic-ruled karakhanids , a well a the seljuk ( sultan sanjar ) and kara-khitans .
the mongol empire conquest under genghis khan during the 13th century would bring about a change to the region . the mongol invasion of central asia led to the displacement of some of the iranian-speaking people of the region , their culture and heritage being superseded by that of the mongols-turkic people who came thereafter . the invasion of bukhara , samarkand , knergen and others resulted in destruction under the mongol empire and unprecedented destruction , such a portion of khwarazmian empire being completely razed .
following the death of genghis khan in 1227 , his empire wa divided among his four son and his family member . despite the potential for serious fragmentation , the mongol law of the mongol empire maintained orderly succession for several more generation , and control of most of transoxiana stayed in the hand of the direct descendant of chagatai khan , the second son of genghis khan . orderly succession , prosperity , and internal peace prevailed in the chaghatai land , and the mongol empire a a whole remained a strong and united kingdom ( ulus batiy , sattarkhan ) .
during this period , most of present uzbekistan wa part of the chagatai khanate except khwarezm wa part of the golden horde . after the decline of the golden horde , khwarezm wa briefly ruled by the sufi dynasty till timur 's conquest of it in 1388 . sufids rule khwarezm a vassal of alternatively timurids , golden horde and khanate of bukhara till persian occupation in 1510.
in the early 14th century , however , a the empire began to break up into it constituent part , the chaghatai territory wa disrupted a the prince of various tribal group competed for influence . one tribal chieftain , timur ( tamerlane ) , emerged from these struggle in the 1380s a the dominant force in transoxiana . although , he wa not a descendant of genghis khan , timur became the de facto ruler of transoxiana and proceeded to conquer all of western central asia , iran , the caucasus , mesopotamia , asia minor , and the southern steppe region north of the aral sea . he also invaded russia before dying during an invasion of ming dynasty in 1405.
timur wa known for his extreme brutality and his conquest were accompanied by genocidal massacre in the city he occupied .
timur initiated the last flowering of transoxiana by gathering together numerous artisan and scholar from the vast land he had conquered into his capital , samarqand . by supporting such people , he imbued his empire with a rich perso-islamic culture . during his reign and the reign of his immediate descendant , a wide range of religious and palatial construction masterpiece were undertaken in samarqand and other population centre . amir timur initiated an exchange of medical discovery and patronised physician , scientist and artist from the neighbouring region such a india ; his grandson ulugh beg wa one of the world 's first great astronomer . it wa during the timurid dynasty that turkic , in the form of the chagatai language dialect , became a literary language in it own right in transoxiana , although the timurids were persianate in nature . the greatest chaghataid writer , ali-shir nava ' i , wa active in the city of herat ( now in northwestern afghanistan ) in the second half of the 15th century .
the timurid state quickly split in half after the death of timur . the chronic internal fighting of the timurids attracted the attention of the uzbek nomadic tribe living to the north of the aral sea . in 1501 the uzbek force began a wholesale invasion of transoxiana . the slave trade in the emirate of bukhara became prominent and wa firmly established . before the arrival of the russian , present uzbekistan wa divided between emirate of bukhara and khanate of khanate of khiva and khanate of kokand .
in the 19th century , the russian empire began to expand and spread into central asia . there were 210,306 russian living in uzbekistan in 1912 . the `` great game '' period is generally regarded a running from approximately 1813 to the anglo-russian convention of 1907 . a second , le intensive phase followed the october revolution of 1917 . at the start of the 19th century , there were some separating british india and the outlying region of imperial russia . much of the land between wa unmapped .
by the beginning of 1920 , central asia wa firmly in the hand of russia and , despite some early resistance to the bolshevik , uzbekistan and the rest of the central asia became a part of the soviet union . on 27 october 1924 the uzbek soviet socialist republic wa created . from 1941 to 1945 , during world war ii , 1,433,230 people from uzbekistan fought in the red army against nazi germany . a number also ostlegionen . a many a 263,005 uzbek soldier died in the battlefield of the eastern front ( world war ii ) , and 32,670 went missing in action .
on 20 june 1990 , uzbekistan declared it state sovereignty . on 31 august 1991 , uzbekistan declared independence after the 1991 soviet coup d'tat attempt in moscow . 1 september wa proclaimed the national independence day . the soviet union wa dissolution of the soviet union on 26 december of that year .

uzbekistan improved marginally in the 2020 ease of doing business ranking by the world bank .
the largest corporation involved in uzbekistan 's energy sector are the china national petroleum corporation ( cnpc ) , petronas , the korea national oil corporation , gazprom , lukoil , and uzbekneftegas .
along with many commonwealth of independent state or ci economy , uzbekistan 's economy declined during the first year of transition and then recovered after 1995 , a the cumulative effect of policy reform began to be felt . it ha shown robust growth , rising by 4 % per year between 1998 and 2003 and accelerating thereafter to 7 % 8 % per year . according to imf estimate , the gdp in 2008 will be almost double it value in 1995 ( in constant price ) . since 2003 annual inflation rate varied , reaching almost 40 % in 2010 and le than 20 % in 2019.
uzbekistan ha gni per caput of u $ 2,020 in current dollar in 2018 , giving a purchasing power parity equivalent of u $ 7,230 . economic production is concentrated in commodity . in 2011 , uzbekistan wa the world 's seventh-largest producer and fifth-largest exporter of cotton a well a the seventh-largest world producer of gold . it is also a regionally significant producer of natural gas , coal , copper , oil , silver and uranium .
agriculture in uzbekistan employ 27 % of uzbekistan 's labour force and contributes 17.4 % of it gdp ( 2012 data ) . cultivable land is 4.4 million hectare , or about 10 % of uzbekistan 's total area . while official unemployment is very low , underemployment  especially in rural area  is estimated to be at least 20 % . cotton production in uzbekistan is important to the national economy of the country . uzbek cotton is even used to make banknote in south korea . the country ha a considerable production of carrot a well . the use of child labour in uzbekistan ha led several company , including tesco , c & a , mark & spencer , gap , and h & m , to boycott uzbek cotton .
facing a multitude of economic challenge upon acquiring independence , the government adopted an evolutionary reform strategy , with an emphasis on state control , reduction of import and self-sufficiency in energy . since 1994 , the state-controlled medium have repeatedly proclaimed the success of this `` uzbekistan economic model '' and suggested that it is a unique example of a smooth transition to the market economy while avoiding shock , pauperism and stagnation . a of 2019 , uzbekistan 's economy is one of the most diversified in central asia what make the country an attractive economic partner for china .
the gradualist reform strategy ha involved postponing significant macroeconomic and structural reform . the state in the hand of the new class ha remained a dominant influence in the economy . corruption permeates the society and grows more rampant over time : uzbekistan 's 2005 corruption perception index wa 137 out of 159 country , whereas in 2007 uzbekistan wa 175th out of 179 country . a february 2006 report on the country by the international crisis group suggests that revenue earned from key export , especially cotton , gold , corn and increasingly gas , are distributed among a very small circle of the ruling elite , with little or no benefit for the populace at large . the recent high-profile corruption scandal involving government contract and large international company , notably telecom corruption scandal , have shown that business are particularly vulnerable to corruption when operating in uzbekistan .

the economic policy have repelled foreign investment , which is the lowest per caput in the ci . for year , the largest barrier to foreign company entering the uzbekistan market ha been the difficulty of converting currency . in 2003 the government accepted the obligation of article viii under the international monetary fund ( imf ) providing for full currency convertibility . however , strict currency control and the tightening of border have lessened the effect of this measure .
uzbekistan experienced rampant inflation of around 1000 % per year immediately after independence ( 19921994 ) . stabilisation effort implemented with guidance from the imf paid off . the inflation rate were brought down to 50 % in 1997 and then to 22 % in 2002 . since 2003 annual inflation rate averaged le than 10 % . tight economic policy in 2004 resulted in a drastic reduction of inflation to 3.8 % ( although alternative estimate based on the price of a true market basket put it at 15 % ) . the inflation rate moved up to 6.9 % in 2006 and 7.6 % in 2007 but have remained in the single-digit range .
the government of uzbekistan restricts foreign import in many way , including high import duty . excise tax are applied in a highly discriminatory manner to protect locally produced good , although the excise tax were removed in for foreign car in 2020 . official tariff are combined with unofficial , discriminatory charge resulting in total charge amounting to a much a 100 to 150 % of the actual value of the product , making imported product virtually unaffordable . import substitution is an officially declared policy and the government proudly report a reduction by a factor of two in the volume of consumer good imported . a number of ci country are officially exempt from uzbekistan import duty . uzbekistan ha a bilateral investment treaty with fifty other country .
the tashkent stock exchange ( rse ) opened in 1994 . the stock of all uzbek joint stock company ( around 1,250 ) are traded on rse . the number of listed company a of january 2013 exceeds 110 . security market volume reached 2 trillion in 2012 , and the number is rapidly growing due to the rising interest by company of attracting necessary resource through the capital market . according to central depository a of january 2013 par value of outstanding share of uzbek emitter exceeded nine trillion .
thanks in part to the recovery of world market price of gold and cotton ( the country 's key export commodity ) , expanded natural gas and some manufacturing export , and increasing labour migrant transfer , the current account turned into a large surplus ( between 9 % and 11 % of gdp from 2003 to 2005 ) . in 2018 , foreign exchange reserve , including gold , totalled around u $ 25 billion .
foreign exchange reserve amounted in 2010 to u $ 13 billion .

<section_title_start> religion <section_title_end>
uzbekistan is a secular country and article 61 of it constitution state that religious organization and association shall be separated from the state and equal before law . the state shall not interfere in the activity of religious association . islam is the dominant religion in uzbekistan , although soviet power ( 19241991 ) discouraged the expression of religious belief , and it wa repressed during it existence a a soviet union . the cia factbook estimate that muslim constitute 88 % of the population ( mostly sunni ) while 9 % of the population follow russian orthodox , 4 % other religious and non-religious . while a 2010 pew research center report stated that uzbekistan 's population is 96.5 % muslim . russian orthodox comprised 2.3 % of the population in 2010 . an estimated 93,000 jew lived in the country in the early 1990s .

despite the predominance of islam and it rich history in the country , the practice of the faith is far from monolithic . uzbek have practised many version of islam . the conflict of islamic tradition with various agenda of reform movement or secularisation throughout the 20th century ha left a wide variety of islamic practice in central asia . 96.3 % are sunni muslim and rest secular or non-believers ; 1 % are shia .
the end of soviet control in uzbekistan in 1991 did not bring an immediate upsurge of religion-associated fundamentalism , a many had predicted , but rather a gradual re-acquaintance with the precept of the islamic faith and a gradual resiurgence of islam in the country . however , since 2015 there ha been a slight increase in islamism activity , with small organisation such a the islamic movement of uzbekistan declaring allegiance to isil and contributing fighter abroad , although the terror threat in uzbekistan itself remains low . ( see terrorism in uzbekistan ) .

<section_title_start> military <section_title_end>
with close to 65,000 serviceman , uzbekistan posse the largest armed force in central asia . the military structure is largely inherited from the turkestan military district of the soviet army , although it is going through a reform to be based mainly on motorised infantry with some light and special force . the uzbek armed force ' equipment is standard , mostly consisting those of post-soviet inheritance and newly crafted russian and some american equipment .
the government ha accepted the arm control obligation of the former soviet union , acceded to the nuclear non-proliferation treaty ( a a non-nuclear state ) , and supported an active program by the u.s. defense threat reduction agency ( dtra ) in western uzbekistan ( nukus and vozrozhdeniye island ) . the government of uzbekistan spends about 3.7 % of gdp on the military but ha received a growing infusion of foreign military financing ( fmf ) and other security assistance fund since 1998.
following 11 september 2001 terrorist attack in the u.s. , uzbekistan approved the u.s. central command 's request for access to an air base , the karshi-khanabad airfield , in southern uzbekistan . however , uzbekistan demanded that the u.s. withdraw from the airbases after the andijan massacre and the u.s. reaction to this massacre . the last u troop left uzbekistan in november 2005 . in 2020 , it wa revealed that the former u base wa contaminated with radioactive material which may have resulted in unusually high cancer rate in u personnel stationed there .
on 23 june 2006 , uzbekistan became a full participant in the collective security treaty organization ( csto ) , but informed the csto to suspend it membership in june 2012.
<section_title_start> foreign relations <section_title_end>
uzbekistan joined the commonwealth of independent state in december 1991 . however , it is opposed to reintegration and withdrew from the ci collective security arrangement in 1999 . since that time , uzbekistan ha participated in the ci peacekeeping force in tajikistan and in un-organized group to help resolve the tajikistan and afghanistan conflict , both of which it see a posing threat to it own stability .
previously close to washington ( which gave uzbekistan half a billion dollar in aid in 2004 , about a quarter of it military budget ) , the government of uzbekistan ha recently restricted american military use of the airbase at karshi-khanabad for air operation in neighbouring afghanistan . uzbekistan wa an active supporter of u.s. effort against worldwide terrorism and joined the coalition that have dealt with both afghanistan and iraq .
the relationship between uzbekistan and the united state began to deteriorate after the so-called `` colour revolution '' in georgia ( country ) and ukraine ( and to a lesser extent kyrgyzstan ) . when the u.s. joined in a call for an independent international investigation of the bloody event at andijan massacre , the relationship further declined , and president islam karimov changed the political alignment of the country to bring it closer to russia and china .
in late july 2005 , the government of uzbekistan ordered the united state to vacate an air base in karshi-kanabad ( near uzbekistan 's border with afghanistan ) within 180 day . karimov had offered use of the base to the u.s. shortly after 9/11 . it is also believed by some uzbek that the protest in andijan were brought about by the uk and u.s. influence in the area of andijan . this is another reason for the hostility between uzbekistan and the west .
uzbekistan is a member of the united nation ( un ) ( since 2 march 1992 ) , the euro-atlantic partnership council ( eapc ) , partnership for peace ( pfp ) , and the organization for security and co-operation in europe ( osce ) . it belongs to the organisation of islamic cooperation ( oic ) and the economic cooperation organization ( eco ) ( comprising the five central asian country , azerbaijan , iran , turkey , afghanistan , and pakistan ) . in 1999 , uzbekistan joined the guam alliance ( georgia , ukraine , azerbaijan and moldova ) , which wa formed in 1997 ( making it guuam ) , but pulled out of the organisation in 2005.
uzbekistan is also a member of the shanghai cooperation organisation ( sco ) and host the sco 's regional anti-terrorist structure ( rat ) in tashkent . uzbekistan joined the new central asian cooperation organisation ( caco ) in 2002 . the caco consists of uzbekistan , tajikistan , kazakhstan and kyrgyzstan . it is a founding member of , and remains involved in , the central asian union , formed with kazakhstan and kyrgyzstan , and joined in march 1998 by tajikistan .
in september 2006 , unesco presented islam karimov an award for uzbekistan 's preservation of it rich culture and tradition . despite criticism , this seems to be a sign of improving relationship between uzbekistan and the west .
the month of october 2006 also saw a decrease in the isolation of uzbekistan from the west . the european union announced that it wa planning to send a delegation to uzbekistan to talk about human right and liberty , after a long period of hostile relation between the two . although it is equivocal about whether the official or unofficial version of the andijan massacre is true , the eu is evidently willing to ease it economic sanction against uzbekistan . nevertheless , it is generally assumed among uzbekistan 's population that the government will stand firm in maintaining it close tie with the russian federation and in it theory that the 20042005 protest in uzbekistan were promoted by the u and uk .
in january 2008 , lola karimova-tillyaeva wa appointed to her current role a uzbekistan 's ambassador to unesco . karimova-tillyaeva and her team have been instrumental in promoting inter-cultural dialogue by increasing european society 's awareness of uzbekistan 's cultural and historical heritage .
<section_title_start> culture <section_title_end>
uzbekistan ha a wide mix of ethnic group and culture , with the uzbek being the majority group . in 1995 about 71 % of uzbekistan 's population wa uzbek . the chief minority group were russian ( 8 % ) , tjik people ( 34.7 % ) , kazakh ( 4 % ) , tatar ( 2.5 % ) and karakalpak ( 2 % ) . it is said , however , that non-uzbeks decline a russian and other minority group slowly leave and uzbek return from other part of the former soviet union .
when uzbekistan gained independence in 1991 , there wa concern that muslim fundamentalism would spread across the region . the expectation wa that a country long denied freedom of religious practice would undergo a very rapid increase in the expression of it dominant faith . a of 1994 , over half of uzbekistan 's population wa said to be muslim , and increasing , though in an official survey few had any real knowledge of the religion or knew it detailed teaching .
<section_title_start> music <section_title_end>
central asian classical music is called shashmaqam , which arose in bukhara in the late 16th century when that city wa a regional capital . shashmaqam is closely related to azerbaijani mugam and uyghur muqam . the name , which translates a six maqams refers to the structure of the music , which contains six section in six different musical mode , similar to classical persian traditional music . interlude of spoken sufi poetry interrupt the music , typically beginning at a lower register and gradually ascending to a climax before calming back down to the beginning tone .
<section_title_start> education <section_title_end>
uzbekistan ha a high literacy rate , with 99.9 % of adult above the age of 15 being able to read and write . however , with only 76 % of the under-15 population currently enrolled in education ( and only 20 % of the 36 year old attending pre-school ) , this figure may drop in the future . student attend school monday through saturday during the school year , and education officially concludes at the end of the 12th grade . there are two international school operating in uzbekistan , both in tashkent : the british school catering for elementary student only , and tashkent international school , a k-12 international curriculum school .
uzbekistan ha encountered severe budget shortfall in it education program . the education law of 1992 began the process of theoretical reform , but the physical base ha deteriorated and curriculum revision ha been slow . a large contributor to this decline is the low level of wage received by teacher and the lack of spending on infrastructure , building and resource on behalf of the government . corruption within the education system is also rampant , with student from wealthier family routinely bribing teacher and school executive to achieve high grade without attending school , or undertaking official examination .
uzbekistan 's university create almost 600,000 graduate annually , though the general standard of university graduate , and the overall level of education within the tertiary system , is low . several university , including westminster international university in tashkent , turin university , management development institute of singapore in tashkent , bucheon university in tashkent , team university tashkent and inha university tashkent maintain a campus in tashkent offering english language course across several discipline . the russian-language high education is provided by most national university , including foreign moscow state university and gubkin russian state university of oil and gas , maintaining campus in tashkent . a of 2019 , webster university , in partnership with the ministry of education , ha opened a graduate school offering an mba in project management and a ma in teaching english a a second language ( tesl ) .

<section_title_start>  early history  <section_title_end>
neanderthal settlement in ukraine is seen in the molodova archaeological site ( 43,00045,000 bc ) which include a mammoth bone dwelling . the territory is also considered to be the likely location for the human domestication of the horse .
modern human settlement in ukraine and it vicinity date back to 32,000 bc , with evidence of the gravettian culture in the crimean mountain . by 4,500 bc , the neolithic cucutenitrypillia culture flourished in wide area of modern ukraine including trypillia and the entire dnieper-dniester region . during the iron age , the land wa inhabited by cimmerians , scythian , and sarmatians . between 700 ; bc and 200 ; bc it wa part of the scythian kingdom , or scythia .
beginning in the sixth century bc , colony of ancient greece , ancient rome , and the byzantine empire , such a tyras , olbia , ukraine , and chersonesus , were founded on the northeastern shore of the black sea . these colony thrived well into the sixth ; century ad . the goth stayed in the area , but came under the sway of the hun from the 370s ad . in the seventh ; century ad , the territory that is now eastern ukraine wa the centre of old great bulgaria . at the end of the century , the majority of bulgar tribe migrated in different direction , and the khazars took over much of the land .

<section_title_start>  golden age of kyiv  <section_title_end>
kievan ru ' wa founded in the territory of the polans ( eastern ) , who lived among the river ro river , rosava river , and dnieper . russian historian boris rybakov came from studying the linguistics of russian chronicle to the conclusion that the polans union of clan of the mid-dnieper region called itself by the name of one of it clan , `` ro '' , that joined the union and wa known at least since the 6th century far beyond the slavic world . the origin of the kyiv princedom is of a big debate and there exist at least three version depending on interpretation of the chronicle . in general it is believed that kievan ru ' included the central , western and northern part of modern ukraine , belarus , and the far eastern strip of poland . according to the primary chronicle the ru ' elite initially consisted of varangians from scandinavia .
during the 10th and 11th ; century , it became the largest and most powerful state in europe . it laid the foundation for the national identity of ukrainian and russian . kyiv , the capital of modern ukraine , became the most important city of the ru ' . in 12th13th century on effort of yuri the long armed , in area of zalesye were founded several city similar in name a in kievan ru ' such a vladimir , russia/vladimir of zalesye ( volodymyr-volynsky ) , galich , russia ( halych ) , pereslavl-zalessky ( pereyaslav-khmelnytskyi ) , ryazan .
the varangians later assimilated into the slavic population and became part of the first ru ' dynasty , the rurik dynasty . kievan ru ' wa composed of several principality ruled by the interrelated rurikid knyazes ( `` prince '' ) , who often fought each other for possession of kyiv .
the golden age of kievan ru ' began with the reign of vladimir the great ( 9801015 ) , who christianization of kievan ru ' turned ru ' toward byzantine christianity . during the reign of his son , yaroslav the wise ( 10191054 ) , kievan ru ' reached the zenith of it cultural development and military power . the state soon fragmented a the relative importance of regional power rose again . after a final resurgence under the rule of vladimir ii monomakh ( 11131125 ) and his son mstislav i of kiev ( 11251132 ) , kievan ru ' finally disintegrated into separate principality following mstislav 's death .
the 13th-century mongol invasion of ru ' devastated kievan ru ' . kyiv wa totally siege of kyiv ( 1240 ) . on today 's ukrainian territory , the principality of principality of halych and volhynia volodymyr-volynskyi arose , and were merged into the state of kingdom of galicia-volhynia galicia-volhynia .
daniel of galicia ( daniel i of galicia or danylo halytskyi ) son of roman the great , re-united all of south-western ru ' , including volhynia , galicia and ru ' ancient capital of kyiv . danylo wa crowned by the pope archbishop in drohiczyn 1253 a the first monarch of all ru ' . under danylo 's reign , the kingdom of galiciavolhynia wa one of the most powerful state in east central europe .
<section_title_start>  foreign domination  <section_title_end>
in the mid-14th ; century , upon the death of bolesaw jerzy ii of mazovia , king casimir iii of poland initiated campaign ( 13401366 ) to take galicia-volhynia . meanwhile , the heartland of ru ' , including kyiv , became the territory of the grand duchy of lithuania , ruled by gediminas and his successor , after the battle on the irpen ' river . following the 1386 union of krewo , a dynastic union between poland and lithuania , much of what became northern ukraine wa ruled by the increasingly slavicised local lithuanian noble a part of the grand duchy of lithuania . by 1392 the so-called galiciavolhynia war ended . polish coloniser of depopulated land in northern and central ukraine founded or re-founded many town .
in the black sea city of modern-day ukraine , the republic of genoa founded numerous colony , from the mid-13th century to the late 15th century , including the city of bilhorod-dnistrovskyi ( `` moncastro '' ) and kiliya ( `` licostomo '' ) , the colony used to be large commercial center in the region , and were headed by a consul ( a representative of the republic ) .
in 1430 podolia wa incorporated under the crown of the kingdom of poland a podolian voivodeship . in 1441 , in the southern ukraine , especially crimea and surrounding steppe , genghisid prince haci i giray founded the crimean khanate .
in 1569 the union of lublin established the polishlithuanian commonwealth , and much ukrainian territory wa transferred from lithuania to the crown of the kingdom of poland , becoming polish territory de jure . under the demographic , cultural and political pressure of polonisation , which began in the late 14th century , many landed gentry of polish ruthenia ( another name for the land of ru ) converted to catholicism and became indistinguishable from the polish nobility . deprived of native protector among ru nobility , the commoner ( peasant and townspeople ) began turning for protection to the emerging zaporozhian cossack , who by the 17th century became devoutly eastern orthodox church . the cossack did not shy from taking up arm against those they perceived a enemy , including the polish state and it local representative .
formed from golden horde territory conquered after the mongol invasion # european vassal the crimean khanate wa one of the strongest power in eastern europe until the 18th century ; in 1571 it even russo-crimean war ( 1571 ) . the borderland suffered annual crimean-nogai raid into east slavic land . from the beginning of the 16th century until the end of the 17th century , crimean tatar slave raiding band exported about two million slave from russia and ukraine . according to orest subtelny , `` from 1450 to 1586 , eighty-six tatar invasion were recorded , and from 1600 to 1647 , seventy . '' in 1688 , tatar captured a record number of 60,000 ukrainian . the tatar raid took a heavy toll , discouraging settlement in more southerly region where the soil wa better and the growing season wa longer . the last remnant of the crimean khanate wa finally conquered by the russian empire in 1783.
in the mid-17th ; century , a cossack military quasi-state , the zaporozhian host , wa formed by dnieper cossack and by ruthenian peasant who had fled polish serfdom . poland exercised little real control over this population , but found the cossack to be a useful opposing force to the ottoman empire and crimean khanate , and at time the two were ally in ottoman war in europe . however the continued harsh serf of peasantry by polish nobility and especially the suppression of the orthodox church alienated the cossack .
the cossack sought representation in the polish sejm generalny , recognition of orthodox tradition , and the gradual expansion of the registered cossack . these were rejected by the polish nobility , who dominated the sejm .
<section_title_start>  cossack hetmanate  <section_title_end>
in 1648 , bohdan khmelnytsky and petro doroshenko led the khmelnytsky uprising against the commonwealth and the polish king . after khmelnytsky made an entry into kyiv in 1648 , where he wa hailed liberator of the people from polish captivity , he founded the cossack hetmanate , which existed until 1764 ( some source claim until 1782 ) .
khmelnytsky , deserted by his tatar ally , suffered a crushing deafeat at the battle of berestechko in 1651 , and turned to the russian tsar for help . in 1654 , khmelnytsky wa subject to the pereyaslav council , forming a military and political alliance with russia that acknowledged loyalty to the russian tsar .
in 16571686 came `` the ruin ( ukrainian history ) '' , a devastating 30-year war amongst russia , poland , the crimean khanate , the ottoman empire , and cossack for control of ukraine , which occurred at about the same time a the deluge ( history ) of poland . the war escalated in intensity with hundred of thousand of death . the `` treaty of perpetual peace ( 1686 ) '' between russia and poland in 1686 divided the land of the cossack hetmanate between them , reducing the portion over which poland had claimed sovereignty .
in 1709 , cossack hetman ivan mazepa ( 16391709 ) defected to sweden against russia in the great northern war ( 17001721 ) . eventually tsar peter the great recognized that to consolidate and modernize russia 's political and economic power it wa necessary to do away with the cossack hetmanate and ukrainian and cossack aspiration to autonomy . mazepa died in exile after fleeing from the battle of poltava ( 1709 ) , in which the swede and their cossack ally suffered a catastrophic defeat .
the constitution of pylyp orlyk or pact and constitution of right and freedom of the zaporizhian host wa a 1710 constitutional document written by hetman pylyp orlyk , a cossack of ukraine , then within the polishlithuanian commonwealth . it established a standard for the separation of power in government between the legislative , executive , and judiciary branch , well before the publication of montesquieu 's the spirit of the law . the constitution limited the executive authority of the hetman , and established a democratically elected cossack parliament called the general council . the constitution of pylyp orlyk wa unique for it period , and wa one of the first state constitution in europe .
the hetmanate wa abolished in 1764 ; the zaporozhian sich wa abolished in 1775 , a russia centralised control over it land . a part of the partition of poland in 1772 , 1793 and 1795 , the ukrainian land west of the dnieper were divided between russia and austria . from 1737 to 1834 , expansion into the northern black sea littoral and the eastern danube valley wa a cornerstone of russian foreign policy .
lithuanian and pole controlled vast estate in ukraine , and were a law unto themselves . judicial ruling from krakw were routinely flouted , while peasant were heavily taxed and practically tied to the land a serfdom . occasionally the landowner battled each other using army of ukrainian peasant . the pole and lithuanian were roman catholic and tried with some success to convert the orthodox lesser nobility . in 1596 , they set up the `` greek-catholic '' or ukrainian greek catholic church ; it dominates western ukraine to this day . religious differentiation left the ukrainian orthodox peasant leaderless , a they were reluctant to follow the ukrainian noble .
cossack led an uprising , called koliyivshchyna , starting in the ukrainian borderland of the polishlithuanian commonwealth in 1768 . ethnicity wa one root cause of this revolt , which included the massacre of uman that killed ten of thousand of pole and jew . religious warfare also broke out among ukrainian group . increasing conflict between uniate and orthodox parish along the newly reinforced polish-russian border on the dnieper in the time of catherine the great set the stage for the uprising . a uniate religious practice had become more latinized , orthodoxy in this region drew even closer into dependence on the russian orthodox church . confessional tension also reflected opposing polish and russian political allegiance .
after the annexation of crimea by the russian empire in 1783 , novorossiya wa settled by ukrainian and russian . despite promise in the treaty of pereyaslav , the ukrainian elite and the cossack never received the freedom and the autonomy they had expected . however , within the empire , ukrainian rose to the highest russian state and church office . in a later period , tsarist autocracy established a policy of russification , suppressing the use of the ukrainian language in print and in public .
<section_title_start>  19th century , world war i and revolution  <section_title_end>
in the eighteenth and nineteenth century , the territory of today 's ukraine wa included in the governorate ( russia ) of chernigov governorate chernihiv ( chernigov in russian ) , kharkov governorate kharkiv ( kharkov ) , kiev governorate ( 17081764 ) kyiv 17081764 , and little russia governorate ( 17641781 ) little russia 17641781 , podolian governorate podillia ( podolie ) , and volhynian governorate ( volhynia ) with all but the first two informally grouped into the southwestern krai .
after the russo-turkish war ( 17681774 ) , catherine the great and her immediate successor encouraged german immigration into ukraine and especially crimea german , to thin the previously dominant turk population and encourage agriculture . numerous ukrainian , russian , german , bulgarian in ukraine , serb in ukraine and greek in ukraine moved into the northern ponticcaspian steppe formerly known a the `` wild field '' .
with growing urbanization and modernization , and a cultural trend toward romantic nationalism , a ukrainian intelligentsia committed to national rebirth and social justice emerged . the serf-turned-national-poet tara shevchenko ( 18141861 ) and the political theorist mykhailo drahomanov ( 18411895 ) led the growing nationalist movement .
beginning in the 19th century , there wa migration from ukraine to distant area of the russian empire . according to the 1897 census , there were 223,000 ethnic ukrainian in siberia and 102,000 in central asia . an additional 1.6 million emigrated to the east in the ten year after the opening of the trans-siberian railway in 1906 . russian far east area with an ethnic ukrainian population became known a green ukraine .
nationalist and socialist party developed in the late 19th century . austrian galicia ( eastern europe ) , under the relatively lenient rule of the habsburg , became the centre of the nationalist movement .
ukrainian entered world war i on the side of both the central power , under austria , and the triple entente , under russia . 3.5 million ukrainian fought with the military history of imperial russia , while 250,000 fought for the austro-hungarian army . austria-hungary austro-hungarian authority established the ukrainian legion to fight against the russian empire . this became the ukrainian galician army that fought against the bolshevik and pole in the post-world war i period ( 191923 ) . those suspected of russophile sentiment in austria were treated harshly .
world war i destroyed both empire . the russian revolution of 1917 led to the founding of the soviet union under the bolshevik , and subsequent civil war in russia . a ukrainian national movement for self-determination emerged , with heavy communist and socialist influence . several ukrainian state briefly emerged : the internationally recognized ukrainian people 's republic ( unr , the predecessor of modern ukraine , wa declared on 23 june 1917 proclaimed at first a a part of the russian republic ; after the bolshevik revolution , the ukrainian people 's republic proclaimed it independence on 25 january 1918 ) , the ukrainian state , the directorate of ukraine and the pro-bolshevik ukrainian soviet socialist republic ( or soviet ukraine ) successively established territory in the former russian empire ; while the west ukrainian people 's republic and the hutsul republic emerged briefly in the ukrainian land of former austro-hungarian territory .
the short lived act zluky ( unification act ) wa an agreement signed on 22 january 1919 by the ukrainian people 's republic and the west ukrainian people 's republic on the saint sophia cathedral in kyiv st. sophia square in kyiv . this led to civil war , and an anarchism movement called the black guard ( later renamed to the revolutionary insurrectionary army of ukraine ) developed in southern ukraine under the command of the anarchist nestor makhno during the russian civil war . they protected the operation of `` soviet ( council ) '' and libertarian socialism commune in the free territory , an attempt to form a stateless society anarchism society from 1918 to 1921 during the ukrainian war of independence , fighting both the tsarist armed force of south russia under anton denikin and later the red army under leon trotsky , before being defeated by the latter in august 1921.
poland defeated western ukraine in the polish-ukrainian war , but failed against the bolshevik in kyiv offensive ( 1920 ) . according to the peace of riga , western ukraine wa incorporated into poland , which in turn recognised the ukrainian soviet socialist republic in march 1919 . with establishment of the soviet power , ukraine lost half of it territory , while moldavian autonomy wa established on the left bank of the dniester river . ukraine became a founding member of the union of soviet socialist republic in december 1922.
<section_title_start>  western ukraine , carpathian ruthenia and bukovina  <section_title_end>
the war in ukraine continued for another two year ; by 1921 , however , most of ukraine had been taken over by the soviet union , while galicia and volhynia ( mostly today 's west ukraine ) were incorporated into the second polish republic . modern-day bukovina wa annexed by romania and carpathian ruthenia wa admitted to the first czechoslovak republic a an autonomy .
a powerful underground ukrainian nationalist movement arose in eastern poland in the 1920s and 1930s , which wa formed by ukrainian veteran of the ukrainian-soviet war ( including yevhen konovalets , andriy atanasovych melnyk , and yuriy tyutyunyk ) and wa transformed into the ukrainian military organization and later the organization of ukrainian nationalist organisation of ukrainian nationalist ( oun ) . the movement attracted a militant following among student . hostility between polish state authority and the popular movement led to a substantial number of fatality , and the autonomy which had been promised wa never implemented . the pre-war polish government also exercised anti-ukrainian sentiment ; it restricted right of people who declared ukrainian nationality , belonged to the eastern orthodox church and inhabited the eastern borderland . the ukrainian language wa restricted in every field possible , especially in governmental institution , and the term `` ruthenian '' wa enforced in an attempt to ban the use of the term `` ukrainian '' . despite this , a number of ukrainian party , the ukrainian catholic church , an active press , and a business sector existed in poland . economic condition improved in the 1920s , but the region suffered from the great depression in the early 1930s .

the russian civil war devastated the whole russian empire including ukraine . it left over 1.5 million people dead and hundred of thousand homeless in the former russian empire territory . soviet ukraine also faced the russian famine of 1921 ( primarily affecting the russian volga region-ural ( region ) region ) . during the 1920s , under the ukrainisation policy pursued by the national communist leadership of mykola skrypnyk , soviet leadership encouraged a national renaissance in the culture of ukraine and ukrainian language . ukrainisation wa part of the soviet-wide policy of korenisation ( literally indigenisation ) . the bolshevik were also committed to universal health care , education and social-security benefit , a well a the right to work and housing . woman 's right were greatly increased through new law . most of these policy were sharply reversed by the early 1930s after joseph stalin became the de facto communist party leader .
starting from the late 1920s with a first five-year plan , ukraine wa involved in industrialization in the ussr and the republic 's industrial output quadrupled during the 1930s . the peasantry suffered from the collectivisation in the ussr of agriculture which began during and wa part of the first five-year plan and wa enforced by regular troop and cheka . those who resisted were population transfer in the soviet union and agricultural productivity greatly declined . a member of the collective farm were sometimes not allowed to receive any grain until unrealistic quota were met , million starved to death in a drought and famine in russia and the soviet union known a the holodomor or the `` great famine '' .
scholar are divided a to whether this famine fit the definition of genocide , but the ukrainian parliament and the government of other country have acknowledged it a such .
the communist leadership perceived famine a a mean of class struggle and used starvation a a punishment tool to force peasant into collective farm .
largely the same group were responsible for the mass killing operation during the civil war , collectivisation , and the great purge . these group were associated with yefim yevdokimov ( 18911939 ) and operated in the secret operational division within general state political administration ( state political directorate ) in 192931 . yevdokimov transferred into communist party administration in 1934 , when he became party secretary for north caucasus krai . he appears to have continued advising joseph stalin and nikolai yezhov on security matter , and the latter relied on yevdokimov 's former colleague to carry out the mass killing operation that are known a the great terror in 193738 .
on 13 january 2010 , kyiv appellate court posthumously found stalin , lazar kaganovich and other soviet communist party functionary guilty of genocide against ukrainian during the holodomor famine .
<section_title_start>  world war ii  <section_title_end>
following the invasion of poland in september 1939 , nazi germany and soviet army troop divided the territory of poland . thus , eastern galicia ( eastern europe ) and volhynia with their ukrainian population became part of ukraine . for the first time in history , the nation wa united .
in 1940 , the soviet annexed bessarabia and northern bukovina . the ukrainian ssr incorporated the northern and southern district of bessarabia , northern bukovina , and the hertsa region . but it ceded the western part of the moldavian autonomous soviet socialist republic to the newly created moldavian soviet socialist republic . these territorial gain of the ussr were internationally recognized by the paris peace treaty , 1947.
wehrmacht operation barbarossa on 22 june 1941 , initiating nearly four year of total war . the axis power initially advanced against desperate but unsuccessful effort of the red army . in the encirclement battle of kyiv ( 1941 ) , the city wa acclaimed a a `` hero city '' , because of it fierce battle of kyiv ( 1941 ) . more than 600,000 soviet soldier ( or one-quarter of the soviet western front ) were killed or taken captive there , with many suffering german mistreatment of soviet prisoner of war .
although the majority of ukrainian fought in or alongside the red army and soviet partisan , in western ukraine an independent ukrainian insurgent army movement arose ( upa , 1942 ) . created a armed force of the underground ( organization of ukrainian nationalist , oun ) which had developed in second polish republic a a reactionary nationalist organization . during the interwar period , the history of the ukrainian minority in poland # policy of jzef pisudski and the `` volhynia experiment '' polish government 's policy towards the ukrainian minority were initially very accommodating , however by the late 1930s they became increasingly harsh due to civil unrest . both organization , oun and upa supported the goal of an declaration of ukrainian independence , 1941 on the territory with a ukrainian ethnic majority . although this brought conflict with nazi germany , at time the andriy atanasovych melnyk wing of the oun allied with the nazi force . also , upa division carried out massacre of pole in volhynia and eastern galicia , killing around 100,000 polish civilian , which brought reprisal . after the war , the upa continued to fight the ussr until the 1950s . at the same time , the ukrainian liberation army , another nationalist movement , fought alongside the nazi .
in total , the number of ethnic ukrainian who fought in the rank of the soviet army is estimated from 4.5 ; million to 7 ; million . the soviet partisan pro-soviet partisan guerrilla resistance in ukraine is estimated to number at 47,800 from the start of occupation to 500,000 at it peak in 1944 , with about 50 % being ethnic ukrainian . generally , the ukrainian insurgent army 's figure are unreliable , with figure ranging anywhere from 15,000 to a many a 100,000 fighter .
most of the ukrainian ssr wa organised within the reichskommissariat ukraine , with the intention of exploiting it resource and eventual german settlement . some western ukrainian , who had only joined the soviet union in 1939 , hailed the german a liberator . brutal german rule eventually turned their supporter against the nazi administrator , who made little attempt to exploit dissatisfaction with stalinist policy . instead , the nazi preserved the collective-farm system , carried out mass graf in the soviet union against history of the jew in ukraine , ost-arbeiter , and began a depopulation program to prepare for german colonisation . they blockaded the transport of food on the kyiv river .
the vast majority of the fighting in world war ii took place on the eastern front ( world war ii ) . by some estimate , 93 % of all german casualty took place there . the world war ii casualty of the soviet union inflicted upon the ukrainian population during the war are estimated at about 6 million , including an estimated one and a half million jew killed by the einsatzgruppen , sometimes with the help of local collaborator . of the estimated 8.6 million soviet troop loss , 1.4 ; million were ethnic ukrainian . victory day ( eastern front ) is celebrated a one of ten ukrainian national holiday .

soviet ukraine soon became a european leader in industrial production , and an important centre of the soviet arm industry and high-tech research . such an important role resulted in a major influence of the local elite . many member of the soviet leadership came from ukraine , most notably leonid brezhnev . he later ousted khrushchev and became the soviet leader from 1964 to 1982 . many prominent soviet sport player , scientist , and artist came from ukraine .
on 26 april 1986 , a reactor in the chernobyl nuclear power plant exploded , resulting in the chernobyl disaster , the worst nuclear reactor accident in history . this wa the only accident to receive the highest possible rating of 7 by the international nuclear event scale , indicating a `` major accident '' , until the fukushima daiichi nuclear disaster in march 2011 . at the time of the accident , 7 million people lived in the contaminated territory , including 2.2 million in ukraine .

the landscape of ukraine consists mostly of fertile plain ( or steppe ) and plateau , crossed by river such a the dnieper river ( dnipro ) , seversky donets , dniester and the southern bug a they flow south into the black sea and the smaller sea of azov . to the southwest , the danube delta of the danube form the border with romania . ukraine 's various region have diverse geographic feature ranging from the highland to the lowland . the country 's only mountain are the carpathian mountain in the west , of which the highest is the hora hoverla at , and the crimean mountain on crimea , in the extreme south along the coast . however ukraine also ha a number of highland region such a the volhynian-podolian upland volyn-podillia upland ( in the west ) and the near-dnipro upland ( on the right bank of dnieper ) ; to the east there are the south-western spur of the central russian upland over which run the border with the russian federation . near the sea of azov can be found the donets ridge and the near azov upland . the snow melt from the mountain feed the river , and natural change in altitude form sudden drop in elevation and give rise to waterfall of ukraine .

from northwest to southeast the soil of ukraine may be divided into three major aggregation :
* a zone of sandy podzolized soil
* a central belt consisting of the extremely fertile ukrainian black earth ( chornozem )
* a zone of chestnut and soil salinity
a much a two-thirds of the country 's surface land consists of the so-called black earth , a resource that ha made ukraine one of the most fertile region in the world and well known a a `` breadbasket '' . these soil may be divided into three broad group :
* in the north a belt of the so-called deep chernozems , about thick and rich in humus
* south and east of the former , a zone of prairie , or ordinary , chernozems , which are equally rich in humus but only about thick
* the southernmost belt , which is even thinner and ha still le humus
interspersed in various upland and along the northern and western perimeter of the deep chernozems are mixture of gray forest soil and podzolized black-earth soil , which together occupy much of ukraine 's remaining area . all these soil are very fertile when sufficient water is available . however , their intensive cultivation , especially on steep slope , ha led to widespread soil erosion and gullying .
the smallest proportion of the soil cover consists of the chestnut soil of the southern and eastern region . they become increasingly salinized to the south a they approach the black sea .
<section_title_start>  climate  <section_title_end>

the ruling on the 2004 constitutional amendment became a major topic of political discourse . much of the concern wa based on the fact that neither the constitution of 1996 nor the constitution of 2004 provided the ability to `` undo the constitution '' , a the decision of the constitutional court would have it , even though the 2004 constitution arguably ha an exhaustive list of possible procedure for constitutional amendment ( article 154159 ) . in any case , the current constitution could be modified by a vote in parliament .
on 21 february 2014 an agreement between president viktor yanukovych and opposition leader saw the country return to the 2004 constitution . the historic agreement , brokered by the european union , followed protest that began in late november 2013 and culminated in a week of violent clash in which score of protester were killed . in addition to returning the country to the 2004 constitution , the deal provided for the formation of a coalition government , the calling of early election , and the release of former prime minister yulia tymoshenko from prison . a day after the agreement wa reached the ukraine parliament dismissed yanukovych and installed it speaker oleksandr turchynov a interim president and arseniy yatsenyuk a the prime minister of ukraine .

<section_title_start>  literature  <section_title_end>
the history of ukrainian literature date back to the 11th ; century , following the christianisation of kievan ru ' . the writing of the time were mainly liturgical and were written in old church slavonic . historical account of the time were referred to a chronicle , the most significant of which wa the primary chronicle . literary activity faced a sudden decline during the mongol invasion of ru ' .
ukrainian literature again began to develop in the 14th ; century , and wa advanced significantly in the 16th ; century with the introduction of printing and with the beginning of the cossack era , under both russian and polish dominance . the cossack established an independent society and popularized a duma ( epic ) of epic poem , which marked a high point of ukrainian oral literature . these advance were then set back in the 17th and early 18th ; century , when publishing in the ukrainian language wa outlawed and prohibited . nonetheless , by the late 18th ; century modern literary ukrainian finally emerged .
the 19th ; century initiated a vernacular period in ukraine , led by ivan kotliarevsky 's work eneyida , the first publication written in modern ukrainian . by the 1830s , ukrainian romanticism began to develop , and the nation 's most renowned cultural figure , romanticist poet-painter tara shevchenko emerged . where ivan kotliarevsky is considered to be the father of literature in the ukrainian vernacular ; shevchenko is the father of a national revival .
then , in 1863 , use of the ukrainian language in print wa effectively em ukaz by the russian empire . this severely curtailed literary activity in the area , and ukrainian writer were forced to either publish their work in russian or release them in austrian controlled galicia ( central europe ) . the ban wa never officially lifted , but it became obsolete after the revolution and the bolshevik ' coming to power .
ukrainian literature continued to flourish in the early soviet year , when nearly all literary trend were approved ( the most important literary figure of that time were mykola khvylovy , valerian pidmohylny , mykola kulish , mykhayl semenko and some others ) . these policy faced a steep decline in the 1930s , when prominent representative a well a many others were killed by nkvd a part of the great purge . in general around 223 writer were repressed by what wa known a the executed renaissance . these repression were part of stalin 's implemented policy of socialist realism . the doctrine did not necessarily repress the use of the ukrainian language , but it required that writer follow a certain style in their work .
in post-stalinist time literary activity continued to be somewhat limited under the communist party . the most famous figure of ukrainian post-war soviet literature were lina kostenko , dmytro pavlychko , borys oliynyk ( poet ) , ivan drach , oles honchar , vasyl stus , vasyl symonenko .
literary freedom grew in the late 1980s and early 1990s alongside the decline and collapse of the ussr and the reestablishment of ukrainian independence in 1991.
<section_title_start>  architecture  <section_title_end>
ukrainian architecture includes the motif and style that are found in structure built in modern ukraine , and by ukrainian worldwide .
these include initial root which were established in the eastern slav state of kievan ru ' . since the christianization of kievan ru ' for several age ukrainian architecture wa influenced by the byzantine architecture . after the mongol invasion of ru , the distinct architectural history continued in the principality of galicia-volhynia . during the epoch of the zaporozhian cossack , a new style unique to ukraine wa developed under the western influence of the polishlithuanian commonwealth . after the union with the tsardom of russia , many structure in the larger eastern , russian-ruled area were built in the style of russian architecture of that period , whilst the western galicia ( central europe ) wa developed under architecture of austria austro-hungarian architectural influence . ukrainian national motif would finally be used during the period of the soviet union and in modern independent ukraine .
the great architecture of kievan ru ' church of the ru ' , built after the baptism of kievan ru ' in 988 , were the first example of monumental architecture in the east slavic land . the architectural style of the kyivan state wa strongly influenced by the byzantine architecture . early eastern orthodox church were mainly made of wood , with the simplest form of church becoming known a a cell church . major cathedral often featured score of small dome , which led some art historian to take this a an indication of the appearance of pre-christian pagan slavic temple .
several example of these church survive ; however , during the 16th , 17th and 18th century , many were externally rebuilt in the ukrainian baroque style ( see below ) . example include the grand saint sophia 's cathedral , kyiv st. sophia of kyiv ;  the year 1017 is the earliest record of foundation laid , church of the saviour at berestove  built from 1113 to 1125 and st. cyril 's monastery , kyiv st. cyril 's church , circa 12th-century . all can still be found in the ukrainian capital . several building were reconstructed during the late-19th century , including the : file : wladimirwolynsk uspenski cathedral.jpeg in volodymyr-volynskyi , built in 1160 and reconstructed in 18961900 , the : file : ax chernigiv pyatnitska church.jpg , built in 1201 with reconstruction done in the late 1940s , and the golden gate , kyiv , built in 1037 and reconstructed in 1982 . the latter 's reconstruction wa criticised by some art and architecture historian a a revivalist fantasy . unfortunately little secular or vernacular architecture of kievan ru ' ha survived .
a ukraine became increasingly integrated into the russian empire , russian architect had the opportunity to realise their project in the picturesque landscape that many ukrainian city and region offered . st andrew 's church , kyiv st. andrew 's church of kyiv ( 17471754 ) , built by bartolomeo rastrelli , is a notable example of baroque architecture , and it location on top of the kyivan mountain made it a recognisable monument of the city . an equally notable contribution of rasetrelli wa the mariyinsky palace , which wa built to be a summer residence to russian empress elizabeth of russia . during the reign of the last hetmans of ukrainian cossack , kirill razumovsky , many of the cossack hetmanate 's town such a hlukhiv , baturyn and koselets had grandiose project built by andrey kvasov . russia eventually conquered the south of ukraine and crimea , and renamed them a new russia . new city such a mykolayiv , odessa , kherson and sevastopol were founded . these would contain notable example of imperial russian architecture .
in 1934 , the capital of soviet ukraine moved from kharkiv to kyiv . previously , the city wa seen a only a regional centre , hence received little attention . all of that wa to change , at great price . the first example of stalinist architecture were already showing , and , in light of the official policy , a new city wa to be built on top of the old one . this meant that much-admired example such a the st. michael 's golden-domed monastery were destroyed . even the st. sophia cathedral wa under threat . also , the second world war contributed to the wreckage . after the war , a new project for the reconstruction of central kyiv transformed khreshchatyk avenue into a notable example of stalinism in architecture . however , by 1955 , the new politics of architecture once again stopped the project from fully being realised .
the task for modern ukrainian architecture is diverse application of modern aesthetic , the search for an architect 's own artistic style and inclusion of the existing historico-cultural environment . an example of modern ukrainian architecture is the reconstruction and renewal of the maidan nezalezhnosti in central kyiv . despite the limit set by narrow space within the plaza , the engineer were able to blend together the uneven landscape , and use underground space for a new shopping centre .
a major project , which may take up most of the 21st century , is the construction of the kyiv city-centre on the rybalskyi peninsula , which , when finished , will include a dense skyscraper park amid the picturesque landscape of the dnieper river .

belarus , officially the republic of belarus , is a landlocked country in eastern europe . it is bordered by russia to the east and northeast , ukraine to the south , poland to the west , and lithuania and latvia to the northwest . belarus cover an area of , with a population of 9.4 million , and is the list of european country by area thirteenth-largest and the list of european country by population twentieth-most populous country in europe . the country is administratively divided into region of belarus , and is one of the world 's most urbanization by country , with over 40 % of it total land area forested . minsk is the country 's capital and largest city .
until the 20th century , different state at various time controlled the land of modern-day belarus , including kievan ru ' , the principality of polotsk , the grand duchy of lithuania , the polishlithuanian commonwealth , and the russian empire . in the aftermath of the russian revolution in 1917 , different state arose competing for legitimacy amidst the russian civil war , ultimately ending in the rise of the byelorussian soviet socialist republic , which became a founding republic of the soviet union of the soviet union in 1922 . after the polish-soviet war , belarus lost almost half of it territory to poland . much of the border of belarus took their modern shape in 1939 , when some land of the second polish republic were reintegrated into it after the soviet invasion of poland , and were finalized after world war ; ii . during wwii , military operation devastated belarus , which lost about a quarter of it population and half of it economic resource . the republic wa redeveloped in the post-war year . in 1945 , the byelorussian ssr became a founding member of the united nation , along with the soviet union .
the parliament of the republic proclaimed the sovereignty of belarus on 1990 , and during the dissolution of the soviet union , belarus declared independence on 1991 . following the adoption of a new constitution of belarus in 1994 , alexander lukashenko wa elected belarus 's first president in the country 's first and only free 1994 belarusian presidential election post-independence , serving a president ever since . lukashenko openly acknowledges his style of governance a authoritarianism and human right group consider human right in belarus in the country to be poor . belarus is the only country in europe officially using the capital punishment in belarus . lukashenko continued a number of soviet-era policy , such a state ownership of large section of the economy of belarus . in 2000 , belarus and russia signed a treaty for greater cooperation , forming the union state .
belarus is a developing country ranking very high in the human development index . it ha been a member of the united nation since it founding ; and a member of the commonwealth of independent state , the collective security treaty organization , the eurasian economic union , and the non-aligned movement , it ha shown no aspiration for joining the european union but nevertheless maintains a belaruseuropean union relation , and likewise participates in two eu project : the eastern partnership and the baku initiative .
<section_title_start> etymology <section_title_end>
the name belarus is closely related with the term belaya ru ' , i.e. , white ru ' . there are several claim to the origin of the name white ru ' . an ethno-religious theory suggests that the name used to describe the part of old ruthenian land within the grand duchy of lithuania that had been populated mostly by slav who had been christianized early , a opposed to black ruthenia , which wa predominantly inhabited by pagan balts . an alternative explanation for the name comment on the white clothing worn by the local slavic population . a third theory suggests that the old ru ' land that were not conquered by the tatar ( i.e. , polotsk , vitebsk and mogilev ) had been referred to a white ru .
the name ru is often conflated with it latin form russia and ruthenia , thus belarus is often referred to a white russia or white ruthenia . the name first appeared in middle high german literature and medieval latin literature medieval literature ; the chronicle of jan of czarnkw mention the imprisonment of lithuanian grand duke jogaila and his mother at `` albae russiae , poloczk dicto '' in 1381 . the first known use of white russia to refer to belarus wa in the late-16th century by englishman sir jerome horsey , who wa known for his close contact with the russian royal court . during the 17th century , the russian tsar used white ru to describe the land added from the grand duchy of lithuania .
the term belorussia ( link=no  , the latter part similar but spelled and stressed differently from  , russia ) first rose in the day of the russian empire , and the russian tsar wa usually styled `` the tsar of all the russia '' , a russia or the russian empire wa formed by three part of russiathe great russia , little russia , and white ruthenia . this asserted that the territory are all russian and all the people are also russian ; in the case of the belarusian , they were variant of the russian people .
after the bolshevik revolution in 1917 , the term white russia caused some confusion , a it wa also the name of the military force that opposed the red bolshevik . during the period of the byelorussian ssr , the term byelorussia wa embraced a part of a national consciousness . in western belarus under polish control , byelorussia became commonly used in the region of biaystok and grodno during the interwar period .
the term byelorussia ( it name in other language such a english being based on the russian form ) wa only used officially until 1991 . officially , the full name of the country is republic of belarus (   ,   , respublika belarus ) . in russia , the usage of belorussia still is very common . in lithuanian , besides baltarusija ( white russia ) , belarus is also called gudija .
<section_title_start> history <section_title_end>
<section_title_start> early history <section_title_end>
from 5000 to 2000 bc , bandkeramik culture predominated . in addition , remains from the dnieper-donets culture were found in belarus and part of ukraine . cimmerians and other pastoralists roamed through the area by 1,000 bc , and by 500 ad , slav had taken up residence , which wa circumscribed by the scythian who roamed it outskirt . invader from asia , among whom were the hun and avars ( carpathians ) , swept through c. 400600 ad , but were unable to dislodge the slavic presence .
the region that is now belarus wa first settled by baltic people tribe in the 3rd century . around the 5th century , the area wa taken over by slavic tribe . the takeover wa partially due to the lack of military coordination of the balts but the gradual assimilation of the balts into slavic culture wa peaceful in nature .
<section_title_start> kievan rus' <section_title_end>
in the 9th century the territory of modern belarus became part of kievan ru ' , a vast east slavic state ruled by the rurikid dynasty . upon the death of kievan ru ' ruler yaroslav i the wise , the state split into independent principality . many early ru ' principality were virtually razed or severely affected by a major mongol invasion of ru ' in the 13th century , but the land of modern belarus avoided the brunt of the invasion and eventually joined the grand duchy of lithuania . there are no source of military seizure , but the annals affirm the alliance and united foreign policy of principality of polotsk and lithuania for decade . trying to avoid the tatar yoke , the principality of minsk sought protection from lithuanian prince further north and in 1242 , principality of minsk became a part of the expanding grand duchy of lithuania .
incorporation into the grand duchy of lithuania resulted in an economic , political and ethno-cultural unification of belarusian land . of the principality held by the duchy , nine of them were settled by a population that would eventually become belarusian people . during this time , the duchy wa involved in several military campaign , including fighting on the side of poland against the teutonic knight at the battle of grunwald in 1410 ; the joint victory allowed the duchy to control the northwestern borderland of eastern europe .
the grand duchy of moscow , led by ivan iii of russia , began military campaign in 1486 in an attempt to incorporate the former land of kievan ru ' , specifically the territory of modern belarus , russia and ukraine .
<section_title_start> polishlithuanian commonwealth <section_title_end>
on 2 february 1386 , the grand duchy of lithuania and the kingdom of poland ( 10251385 ) were joined in a personal union through a union of krewo . this union set in motion the development that eventually resulted in the formation of the polishlithuanian commonwealth , created in 1569 by the union of lublin .
the lithuanian noble were forced to go for rapprochement because of the threat coming from muscovy .
to strengthen the independence in the format of the union , three edition of the statute of lithuania were issued in the 16th century .
the third article of the statute establishes that all land of the grand duchy of lithuania will be eternally in the grand duchy of lithuania and never enter a a part of other state . it allowed the right to own land within the grand duchy of lithuania to only it own family . anyone from outside the duchy gaining right to a property would actually own it only after swearing allegiance to the grand duke of lithuania . these article were aimed to defend the right of the nobility of the grand duchy of lithuania nobility against polish , prussian and other aristocracy of polishlithuanian commonwealth .
in the year following the union , the process of gradual polonization of both lithuanian and ruthenians gained steady momentum . in culture and social life , both the polish language and catholicism became dominant , and in 1696 , polish replaced ruthenian a the official languagewith the ruthenian language being banned from administrative use . however , the ruthenian peasant continued to speak their own language and remained faithful to the belarusian greek catholic church . statute were initially issued in the ruthenian language alone and later also in polish . around 1840 the statute were banned by the russian tsar following the november uprising . modern ukrainian land used it until 1860s .
<section_title_start> russian empire <section_title_end>
the union between poland and lithuania ended in 1795 with the third partition of poland by imperial russia , prussia , and habsburg monarchy . the belarusian territory acquired by the russian empire under the reign of catherine ii of russia catherine ; ii were included into the belarusian governorate (  - ) in 1796 and held until their occupation by the german empire during world war i.
under nicholas i of russia and alexander iii of russia the national culture were repressed . policy of polonization changed by russification , which included the return to eastern orthodox church of belorusian union of brest . belarusian language wa banned in school while in neighboring samogitia primary school education with samogitian dialect literacy wa allowed .
in a russification drive in the 1840s , nicholas i of russia prohibited use of the belarusian language in public school , campaigned against belarusian publication and tried to pressure those who had converted to catholicism under the pole to reconvert to the orthodox faith . in 1863 , economic and cultural pressure exploded in a january uprising , led by konstanty kalinowski . after the failed revolt , the russian government reintroduced the use of cyrillic script to belarusian in 1864 and no document in belarusian were permitted by the russian government until 1905.
during the negotiation of the treaty of brest-litovsk ( russiacentral power ) treaty of brest-litovsk , belarus first declared independence under german occupation on 1918 , forming the belarusian people 's republic . immediately afterwards , the polishsoviet war ignited , and the territory of belarus wa divided between poland and soviet russia . the rada of the belarusian democratic republic exists a a government in exile ever since then ; in fact , it is currently the world 's longest serving government in exile .
<section_title_start> early state and interwar period <section_title_end>
the belarusian people 's republic wa the first attempt to create an independent belarusian state under name `` belarus '' . despite significant effort the state ceased to exist , primarily because the territory wa continually dominated by the german imperial army and the imperial russian army in world war i , and then the bolshevik red army . it existed from only 1918 to 1919 but created prerequisite for the formation of the state idea around the name `` belarus '' . the choice of the name wa probably based on the fact that the educated core of the newly formed government wa educated in the tsardom university , with a corresponding education around the ideology of west-russianism .
the republic of central lithuania wa a short-lived political entity , which wa the last attempt to restore lithuania in the historical confederacy state ( it wa also supposed to create lithuania upper and lithuania lower ) . the republic wa created in 1920 following eligowski 's mutiny of soldier of the 1st lithuanianbelarusian division of the polish army under lucjan eligowski . centered on the historical capital of the grand duchy of lithuania , vilna ( vilnius , wilno ) , for 18 month the entity served a a buffer state between poland , upon which it depended , and lithuania , which claimed the area . after a variety of delay , 1922 republic of central lithuania general election took place on 8 january 1922 , and the territory wa annexed to poland . eligowski later in his memoir which wa published in london in 1943 condemned the annexation of the republic by poland , a well a the policy of closing belarusian school and general disregard of marshal jzef pisudski 's confederation plan by polish ally . year earlier interrogation report of 19-year-old revolutionary jzef pisudski of 10 march 1887 indicated that he called himself a `` belarusian nobleman '' .
in 1919 a part of belarus under russian rule emerged a the byelorussian soviet socialist republic ( byelorussian ssr ) . soon thereafter it merged to form the lithuanianbelorussian soviet socialist republic lithuanian-byelorussian ssr . the contested land were divided between poland and the soviet union after the war ended in 1921 , and the byelorussian ssr became a founding member of the union of soviet socialist republic in 1922 . in the 1920s and 1930s , soviet agricultural and economic policy , including collectivization and five-year plan for the national economy of the soviet union five-year plan for the national economy , led to famine and political repression .
the western belorussia remained part of the second polish republic . after an early period of liberalization , tension between increasingly nationalistic polish government and various increasingly separatist ethnic minority started to grow , and the belarusian minority in poland wa no exception . the polonization drive wa inspired and influenced by the polish national democracy , led by roman dmowski , who advocated refusing belarusian and ukrainian the right for a free national development . a belarusian organization , the belarusian peasant ' and worker ' union , wa banned in 1927 , and opposition to polish government wa met with state repression . nonetheless compared to the ( larger ) ukrainian minority in poland , belarusian were much le politically aware and active , and thus suffered fewer repression than the ukrainian . in 1935 , after the death of jzef pisudski , a new wave of repression wa released upon the minority , with many eastern orthodox church church and belarusian school being closed . use of the belarusian language wa discouraged . belarusian leadership wa sent to bereza kartuska prison .
<section_title_start> second world war and later soviet period <section_title_end>
in 1939 , nazi germany and the soviet union invaded and occupied poland , marking the beginning of world war ii . the soviet invaded and annexed much of eastern poland , which had been part of the country since the peace of riga two decade earlier . much of the northern section of this area wa added to the byelorussian ssr , and now constitutes west belarus . the soviet-controlled byelorussian people 's council officially took control of the territory , whose population consisted of a mixture of pole , ukrainian , belarusian and jew , on 28 october 1939 in biaystok . nazi germany operation barbarossa in 1941 . the defense of brest fortress of brest fortress wa the first major battle of operation barbarossa .
statistically , the byelorussian ssr wa the hardest-hit soviet republic in world war ii ; it occupation of belarus by nazi germany until 1944 . during that time , germany destroyed 209 out of 290 city in the republic , 85 % of the republic 's industry , and more than one million building . the german generalplan ost called for the extermination , expulsion , or enslavement of most or all belarusian for the purpose of providing more lebensraum in the drang nach osten for german . most of western belorussia became part of the reichskommissariat ostland in 1941 , but in 1943 the german authority allowed local byelorussian collaboration with nazi germany to set up a client state , the belarusian central rada .
the german occupation in 19411944 and war on the eastern front ( world war ii ) devastated belarus . more than 1.6 million civilian and 620,000 belarusian red army soldier died , and the country world war ii casualty of the soviet union lost about 25 % of it population . the history of the jew in belarus wa devastated during the holocaust and never recovered . the population of belarus did not regain it pre-war level until 1971.
after the war , belarus wa among the 51 founding member state of the united nation charter and a such it wa allowed an additional vote at the un , on top of the soviet union 's vote . vigorous postwar reconstruction promptly followed the end of the war and the byelorussian ssr became a major center of manufacturing in the western ussr , creating job and attracting ethnic russian . the border of the byelorussian ssr and poland were redrawn , in accord with the 1919-proposed curzon line .
joseph stalin implemented a policy of sovietization to isolate the byelorussian ssr from western world . this policy involved sending russian from various part of the soviet union and placing them in key position in the byelorussian ssr government . after stalin 's death in 1953 , nikita khrushchev continued his predecessor 's cultural hegemony program , stating , `` the sooner we all start speaking russian , the faster we shall build communism . ''
soviet people belarusian communist politician andrei gromyko , who served a soviet foreign minister ( 19571985 ) and a list of head of state of the soviet union of the presidium of the supreme soviet ( 19851988 ) , wa responsible for many top decision on soviet foreign policy until he wa replaced by eduard shevardnadze . in 1986 , the byelorussian ssr wa contaminated with most ( 70 % ) of the nuclear fallout from the explosion at the chernobyl disaster power plant located 16 ; km beyond the border in the neighboring ukrainian soviet socialist republic .
in june 1988 , the archaeologist and leader of the conservative christian party  bpf zyanon paznyak discovered mass graf of victim executed in 193741 at kurapaty , near minsk . some nationalist contend that this discovery is proof that the soviet government wa trying to erase the belarusian people , causing belarusian nationalist to seek independence .
<section_title_start> independence <section_title_end>
in march 1990 , election for seat in the supreme soviet of the byelorussian ssr took place . though the pro-independence belarusian popular front took only 10 % of the seat , the populace wa content with the selection of the delegate . belarus declared itself sovereign on 1990 by issuing the declaration of state sovereignty of the belarusian soviet socialist republic .
with the support of the communist party , the country 's name wa changed to the republic of belarus on 1991 . stanislau shushkevich , the chairman of the supreme soviet of belarus , met with boris yeltsin of russia and leonid kravchuk of ukraine on 1991 in biaowiea forest to formally declare the dissolution of the soviet union and the formation of the commonwealth of independent state .
a constitution of belarus wa adopted in march 1994 in which the function of prime minister were given to the president of belarus . two-round election for the presidency on ( 1994 and 1994 ) catapulted the formerly unknown alexander lukashenko into national prominence . he garnered 45 % of the vote in the first round and 80 % in the second , defeating vyachaslau kebich who received 14 % of the vote . lukashenko wa re-elected 2001 belarusian presidential election , 2006 belarusian presidential election , 2010 belarusian presidential election and again 2015 belarusian presidential election . western government , amnesty international , and human right watch have criticized lukashenko 's authoritarian style of government .
since 2014 , following year of embrace of russian influence in the country , lukashenko ha pressed a revival of belarusian identity . for the first time , he delivered a speech in belarusian language ( rather than russian , which most belarusian speak a their primary language ) , in which he said , `` we are not russianwe are belarusian '' , and later encouraged the use of belarusian . trade dispute , a border dispute , and a much relaxed official attitude to dissident voice are all part of a weakening of the longtime warm relationship with russia .
in 2019 , lukashenko had bilateral talk in sochi with russian president vladimir putin and declared that their two country `` could unite tomorrow , no problem . '' an idea backed by putin for year , observer have labeled the potential plan a scheme by putin to remain in power beyond 2024 . however , political scientist mikhail vinogradov explained that `` lukashenko will play tough to the public while trying to look weak in front of putin , '' and the carnegie moscow center 's artyom shraibman suggested that `` moscow will most likely fail to find it base among belarusian . ''
202021 belarusian protest erupted across the country following the disputed 2020 belarusian presidential election , in which lukashenko sought a sixth term in office . russian and eu leader warned of any external interference in belarus 's internal affair . the polish government ha allotted a residence for main opposition candidate sviatlana tsikhanouskaya and other member of the belarusian opposition in warsaw , poland . following the disputed election , lukashenko is not recognized by the european union and united state a the legitimate president of belarus . the european union and the united state recently imposed sanction against belarus because of the rigged election and political oppression during to the ongoing protest in the country .

the official portuguese name of the land , in original portuguese record , wa the `` land of the holy cross '' ( terra da santa cruz ) , but european sailor and merchant commonly called it simply the `` land of brazil '' ( terra do brasil ) because of the brazilwood trade . the popular appellation eclipsed and eventually supplanted the official portuguese name . some early sailor called it the `` land of parrot '' .
in the guarani language , an official language of paraguay , brazil is called `` pindorama '' . this wa the name the indigenous population gave to the region , meaning `` land of the palm tree '' .
<section_title_start> history <section_title_end>
<section_title_start> pre-cabraline era <section_title_end>
some of the earliest human remains found in the america , luzia woman , were found in the area of pedro leopoldo , mina gerais and provide evidence of human habitation going back at least 11,000 year .
the earliest pottery ever found in the western hemisphere wa excavated in the amazon basin of brazil and radiocarbon dating to 8,000 year ago ( 6000 bc ) . the pottery wa found near santarm , par and provides evidence that the tropical forest region supported a complex prehistoric culture . the marajoara culture flourished on maraj in the amazon delta from 400 ce to 1400 ce , developing sophisticated pottery , social stratification , large population , mound building , and complex social formation such a chiefdoms .
around the time of the portuguese arrival , the territory of current day brazil had an estimated indigenous population of 7 million people , mostly semi-nomadic , who subsisted on hunting , fishing , gathering , and migrant agriculture . the indigenous population of brazil comprised several large indigenous ethnic group ( e.g . the tup people , guaran people , g people and arawak people ) . the tup people were subdivided into the tupiniquim people and tupinamb people , and there were also many subdivision of the other group .
before the arrival of the european , the boundary between these group and their subgroup were marked by war that arose from difference in culture , language and moral belief . these war also involved large-scale military action on land and water , with cannibalism ritual on prisoner of war . while heredity had some weight , leadership status wa more subdued over time , than allocated in succession ceremony and convention . slavery among the indian had a different meaning than it had for european , since it originated from a diverse socioeconomic organization , in which asymmetry were translated into kinship relation .
<section_title_start> portuguese colonization <section_title_end>
the land now called brazil wa claimed for the portuguese empire on 22 april 1500 , with the arrival of the portuguese fleet commanded by pedro lvares cabral . the portuguese encountered indigenous people divided into several tribe , most of whom spoke language of the tupiguarani family , and fought among themselves . though the first settlement wa founded in 1532 , colonization effectively began in 1534 , when king john iii of portugal john ; iii of portugal divided the territory into the fifteen private and autonomous captaincy of brazil .
however , the decentralized and unorganized tendency of the captaincy colony proved problematic , and in 1549 the portuguese king restructured them into the governorate general of brazil in the city of salvador , bahia , which became the capital of a single and centralized portuguese colony in south america . in the first two century of colonization , indigenous and european group lived in constant war , establishing opportunistic alliance in order to gain advantage against each other . by the mid-16th century , sugar # sugarcane had become brazil 's most important export , and slave purchased in sub-saharan africa , in the slavery in africa # atlantic slave trade ( not only those from portuguese ally of their colony in portuguese angola and portuguese mozambique ) , had become it largest import , to cope with plantation economy of sugarcane , due to increasing international demand for brazilian sugar . portuguese brazil received more than 2.8 million slave from africa between the year of 1500 to 1800.
by the end of the 17th century , sugarcane export began to decline , and the discovery of gold by bandeirantes in the 1690s would become the new backbone of the colony 's economy , fostering a brazilian gold rush which attracted thousand of new settler colonialism to brazil from portugal and all portuguese colony around the world . this increased level of immigration in turn caused war of the emboabas between newcomer and old settler .
portuguese expedition known a bandeirantes gradually advanced the portugal colonial treaty of tordesillas in south america to approximately the current brazilian border . in this era other european power tried to colonize part of brazil , in incursion that the portuguese had to fight , notably the french france antarctique , equinoctial france , and the dutch brazil , during the dutchportuguese war , after the end of iberian union .
the portuguese colonial administration in brazil had two objective that would ensure colonial order and the monopoly of portugal 's wealthiest and largest colony : to keep under control and eradicate all form of slave rebellion and resistance , such a the palmares ( quilombo ) , and to repress all movement for autonomous administrative division or independence , such a the inconfidncia mineira .

in late 1807 , spanish and napoleonic force threatened the security of continental portugal , causing john vi of portugal , in the name of maria i of portugal , to move the royal court from lisbon to transfer of the portuguese court to brazil . there they established some of brazil 's first financial institution , such a it local stock exchange , and it banco do brasil , additionally ending the portuguese monopoly on brazilian trade and opening brazil to other nation . in 1809 , in retaliation for being forced into exile , the prince regent ordered the portuguese conquest of french guiana .
with the end of the peninsular war in 1814 , the court of europe demanded that queen maria i and prince regent joo return to portugal , deeming it unfit for the head of an ancient european monarchy to reside in a colony . in 1815 , to justify continuing to live in brazil , where the royal court had thrived for six year , the crown established the united kingdom of portugal , brazil , and the algarves , thus creating a pluricontinental transatlantic monarchic state . however , the leadership in portugal , resentful of the new status of it larger colony , continued to demand the return of the court to lisbon ( v. liberal revolution of 1820 ) . in 1821 , acceding to the demand of revolutionary who had taken the city of porto , d. joo vi departed for lisbon . there he swore an oath to the new constitution , leaving his son , pedro i of brazil , a regent of the kingdom of brazil .
<section_title_start> independent empire <section_title_end>
tension between portuguese and brazilian increased , and the portuguese cortes , guided by the new political regime imposed by the 1820 liberal revolution , tried to re-establish brazil a a colony . the brazilian refused to yield , and prince pedro decided to stand with them , brazilian declaration of independence declaring the country 's independence from portugal on 7 september 1822 . a month later , prince pedro wa declared the first emperor of brazil , with the royal title of dom pedro i of brazil pedro ; i , resulting in the foundation of the empire of brazil .
the brazilian war of independence , which had already begun along this process , spread through the northern , northeastern region and in cisplatina province . the last portuguese soldier surrendered on 8 march 1824 ; portugal officially recognized brazil on 29 august 1825.
on 7 april 1831 , worn down by year of administrative turmoil and political dissent with both liberal and conservative side of politics , including an attempt of confederation of the equator , and unreconciled to the way that absolutist in portugal had given in the succession of king john vi , pedro ; i went to portugal to liberal war reclaim his daughter 's crown , abdicating the brazilian throne in favor of his five-year-old son and heir ( who thus became the empire 's second monarch , with the royal title of dom pedro ii of brazil pedro ; ii ) .
a the new emperor could not exert his constitutional power until he came of age , a regency ( government ) wa set up by the national assembly . in the absence of a charismatic figure who could represent a moderate face of power , during this period a series of localized rebellion took place , such a the cabanagem in gro-par province , the mal revolt in salvador da bahia , the balaiada ( maranho ) , the sabinada ( bahia ) , and the ragamuffin war , which began in rio grande do sul and wa supported by giuseppe garibaldi . these emerged from the dissatisfaction of the province with the central power , coupled with old and latent social tension peculiar to a vast , slaveholding and newly independent nation state . this period of internal political and social upheaval , which included the praieira revolt in pernambuco , wa overcome only at the end of the 1840s , year after the end of the regency , which occurred with the dom pedro ii # early coronation in 1841.
during the last phase of the monarchy , internal political debate centered on the issue of slavery . the atlantic slave trade wa abandoned in 1850 , a a result of the united kingdom of great britain and ireland aberdeen act , but only in lei urea after a long process of internal mobilization and debate for an ethical and legal dismantling of slavery in brazil , wa the institution formally abolished .
the foreign-affairs policy of the monarchy dealt with issue with the country of the southern cone with whom brazil had border . long after the cisplatine war that resulted in independence for uruguay , brazil won three international war during the 58-year reign of pedro ; ii . these were the platine war , the uruguayan war and the devastating paraguayan war , the largest war effort in brazilian history .
although there wa no desire among the majority of brazilian to change the country 's form of government , on 15 november 1889 , in disagreement with the majority of imperial brazilian army officer , a well a with rural and financial elite ( for different reason ) , the monarchy wa overthrown by a military coup . 15 november is now republic day , a national holiday .
<section_title_start> early republic <section_title_end>
the early republican government wa nothing more than a military dictatorship , with army dominating affair both in rio de janeiro and in the state . freedom of the press disappeared and election were controlled by those in power . not until 1894 , following encilhamento crisis and revolta da armada , did civilian take power , remaining there until october 1930.
if in relation to it foreign policy , the country in this first republican period maintained a relative balance characterized by a success in resolving border dispute with neighboring country , only broken by the acre war ( 18991902 ) and brazil during world war i in world war i ( 19141918 ) , followed by a failed attempt to exert a prominent role in the league of nation ; internally , from the crisis of encilhamento and the revolta da armada , a prolonged cycle of financial , political and social instability began until the 1920s , keeping the country besieged by various rebellion , both civilian and military .
little by little , rebellion and revolution in brazil # 1st republican period ( 1889-1930 ) sparked by these crisis undermined the regime to such an extent that in the wake of the murder of his running mate , the defeated opposition presidential candidate getlio vargas , supported by most of the military , successfully led the brazilian revolution of 1930 . vargas and the military were supposed to assume power temporarily , but instead closed the congress , extinguished the constitution , ruled with emergency power and replaced the state ' governor with their own supporter .
in the 1930s , three failed attempt to remove vargas and his supporter from power occurred . the first wa the constitutionalist revolution in 1932 , led by the so paulo ( state ) oligarchy . the second wa a brazilian uprising of 1935 in november 1935 , and the last one a putsch attempt by brazilian integralism in may 1938 . the 1935 uprising created a security crisis in which the congress transferred more power to the executive . the 1937 coup d'tat resulted in the cancellation of the 1938 election , formalized vargas a dictator , beginning the estado novo ( brazil ) era , which wa noted for government brutality and censorship of the press .
foreign policy during the vargas year wa marked by the antecedent and world war ii . brazil remained neutral until august 1942 , when the country entered on the ally of world war ii , after suffering submarine warfare # atlantic ocean by nazi germany and kingdom of italy # fascist regime ( 19221943 ) , in a strategic dispute over the south atlantic . in addition to battle of the atlantic # south atlantic ( may 1942  september 1943 ) , brazil also sent an brazilian expeditionary force to fight in the italian campaign ( world war ii ) .
with the allied victory in 1945 and the end of the nazi-fascist regime in europe , vargas 's position became unsustainable and he wa swiftly overthrown in another military coup , with democracy `` reinstated '' by the same army that had ended it 15 year earlier . vargas committed suicide in august 1954 amid a political crisis , after having returned to power by election in 1950.
<section_title_start> contemporary era <section_title_end>
several brief interim government followed vargas 's suicide . juscelino kubitschek became president in 1956 and assumed a conciliatory posture towards the opposition ( politics ) that allowed him to govern without major crisis . the economy and industrial sector grew remarkably , but his greatest achievement wa the construction of the new capital city of braslia , inaugurated in 1960.
kubitschek 's successor , jnio quadros , resigned in 1961 le than a year after taking office . his vice-president , joo goulart , assumed the presidency , but aroused strong political opposition and wa 1964 brazilian coup d'tat by a coup that resulted in a brazilian military government .
the new regime wa intended to be transitory but gradually closed in on itself and became a full dictatorship with the promulgation of the ai-5 in 1968 . oppression wa not limited to those who resorted to guerrilla tactic to fight the regime , but also reached institutional opponent , artist , journalist and other member of civil society , inside and outside the country through the infamous `` operation condor '' . despite it brutality , like other authoritarianism , due to an economic boom , known a an `` economic miracle '' , the regime reached a peak in popularity in the early 1970s .
slowly , however , the wear and tear of year of dictatorial power that had not slowed the repression , even after the defeat of the leftist guerrilla , plus the inability to deal with the economic crisis of the period and popular pressure , made an opening policy inevitable , which from the regime side wa led by general ernesto geisel and golbery do couto e silva . with the enactment of the amnesty law # brazil in 1979 , brazil began a slow return to democracy , which wa completed during the 1980s .
civilian returned to power in 1985 when jos sarney assumed the presidency . he became unpopular during his tenure through failure to control the economic crisis and [ he inherited from the military regime . sarney 's unsuccessful government led to the brazilian presidential election , 1989 election in 1989 ] of the almost-unknown [ [ fernando collor de mello , subsequently impeached by the national congress in 1992.
collor wa succeeded by his vice-president , itamar franco , who appointed fernando henrique cardoso minister of finance . in 1994 , cardoso produced a highly successful plano real , that , after decade of failed economic plan made by previous government attempting to curb hyperinflation , finally stabilized the brazilian economy . cardoso won the brazilian presidential election , 1994 , and brazilian presidential election , 1998.
the peaceful transition of power from cardoso to his main opposition leader , luiz incio lula da silva ( brazilian presidential election , 2002 and brazilian presidential election , 2006 re-elected in 2006 ) , wa seen a proof that brazil had achieved a long-sought political stability . however , sparked by indignation and frustration accumulated over decade from corruption , police brutality , inefficiency of the political the establishment and public service , 2013 protest in brazil erupted in brazil from the middle of first term of dilma rousseff , who had succeeded lula after winning election brazilian presidential election , 2010.
rousseff impeachment of dilma rousseff by the brazilian congress in 2016 . large street 201516 protest in brazil took place during the impeachment process . the charge against her were fueled by political and economic crisis along with evidence of involvement with politician ( from all the primary political party ) in several bribery and tax evasion scheme . in 2017 , the supreme court requested the investigation of 71 brazilian lawmaker and nine minister of president michel temer 's cabinet who were allegedly linked to the operation car wash. president temer himself wa also accused of corruption in brazil . according to a 2018 poll , 62 % of the population said that corruption wa brazil 's biggest problem .
starting in 2013 , there is a total change in brazilian politics , with the overthrow of the left-wing politics and the rise of conservatism in right-wing politics . with the discovery that the worker ' party ( brazil ) government have practically gone bankrupt in petrobras , correios and many other state company , through a great diversion of public fund and the use of their fund to bribe the national congress of brazil , the brazilian senate and judiciary , in addition to the indiscriminate use of national bank for economic and social development to finance socialist dictatorship in cuba , venezuela , latin america , africa and the middle east ( with lula and dilma openly supporting controversial figure such a hugo chvez , nicols maduro , mahmoud ahmadinejad , evo morale , vladimir putin , kim jong-un and the chinese communist party , among others ) , also counting on the attempt of dilma roussef to install `` popular council '' to replace the power of the federal deputy , jair bolsonaro , former captain of the army and candidate of the right , is elected . through the operation car wash , the federal police of brazil ha since acted on the deviation and corruption of the pt and allied party at that time . in the 2018 brazilian general election , candidate jair bolsonaro of the social liberal party ( brazil ) ( psl ) wa elected president , who won in the second round fernando haddad , of the worker ' party ( brazil ) ( pt ) , with the support of 55.13 % of the valid vote .

an equatorial climate characterizes much of northern brazil . there is no real dry season , but there are some variation in the period of the year when most rain fall . temperature average , with more significant temperature variation between night and day than between season .
over central brazil rainfall is more seasonal , characteristic of a savanna climate . this region is a extensive a the amazon basin but ha a very different climate a it lie farther south at a higher altitude . in the interior northeast , seasonal rainfall is even more extreme .

in 1908 , france organized french equatorial africa ( aef ) , comprising the middle congo , french gabon , french chad , and oubangui-chari ( the modern central african republic ) . the french designated brazzaville a the federal capital . economic development during the first 50 year of colonial rule in congo centered on natural-resource extraction . the method were often brutal : construction of the congo-ocean railway following world war i ha been estimated to have cost at least 14,000 life .
during the nazi occupation of france during world war ii , brazzaville functioned a the symbolic capital of free france between 1940 and 1943 . the brazzaville conference of 1944 heralded a period of major reform in french colonial policy . congo benefited from the postwar expansion of colonial administrative and infrastructure spending a a result of it central geographic location within aef and the federal capital at brazzaville . it also had a local legislature after the adoption of the 1946 constitution that established the french fourth republic .
following the revision of the constitution of france that established the french fifth republic in 1958 , the aef dissolved into it constituent part , each of which became an autonomous colony within the french community . during these reform , middle congo became known a the republic of the congo in 1958 and published it first constitution in 1959 . antagonism between the mbochis ( who favored jacques opangault ) and the lari people ( congo ) s and kongo people ( who favored fulbert youlou , the first black mayor elected in french equatorial africa ) resulted in a series of riot in brazzaville in february 1959 , which the french army subdued .
new election took place in april 1959 . by the time the congo became independent in august 1960 , opangault , the former opponent of youlou , agreed to serve under him . youlou became the first president of the republic of the congo . since the political tension wa so high in pointe-noire , youlou moved the capital to brazzaville .
<section_title_start> post-independence era <section_title_end>
the republic of the congo became fully independent from france on 15 august 1960 . youlou ruled a the country 's first president until labour element and rival political party instigated a trois glorieuses ( 1963 ) three-day uprising that ousted him . the congolese military briefly took over the country , and installed a civilian provisional government headed by alphonse massamba-dbat .
under the 1963 constitution , massamba-dbat wa elected president for a five-year term . during alphonse massamba-dbat # congo under massamba-dbat ( 1963-1968 ) massamba-dbat 's term in office the regime adopted `` scientific socialism '' a the country 's constitutional ideology . in 1965 , congo established relation with the soviet union , the china people 's republic of china , north korea and north vietnam . on the night of february 14 to 15 , 1965 , three prominent public official of the republic of the congo were kidnapped : lazare matsocota ( prosecutor of the republic ) , joseph pouabou ( president of the supreme court ) and massoum anselme ( director of the congolese information agency ) . the body of two of these men were later found , mutilated , by the congo river . massamba-dbat 's regime also invited several hundred cuban army troop into the country to train his party 's militia unit and these troop helped his government survive a 1966 republic of the congo coup d'tat attempt coup d'tat in 1966 led by paratrooper loyal to future president marien ngouabi . nevertheless , massamba-dbat wa unable to reconcile various institutional , tribal and ideological faction within the country and his regime ended abruptly with a bloodless 1968 republic of the congo coup d'tat .
marie ngouabi , who had participated in the coup , assumed the presidency on 31 december 1968 . one year later , ngouabi proclaimed the congo africa 's first `` people 's republic '' , the people 's republic of the congo , and announced the decision of the national revolutionary movement to change it name to the congolese party of labour ( pct ) . he survived an 1972 republic of the congo coup d'tat attempt but wa assassinated on 16 march1977 . an 11-member military committee of the party ( cmp ) wa then named to head an interim government , with joachim yhombi-opango serving a president . two year later , yhombi-opango wa forced from power and denis sassou nguesso become the new president .

sassou also won the following republic of the congo presidential election , 2009 . according to the congolese observatory of human right , a non-governmental organization , the election wa marked by `` very low '' turnout and `` fraud and irregularity '' . in march 2015 sassou announced that he wanted to run for yet another term in office and a republic of the congo constitutional referendum , 2015 in october resulted in a changed constitution which allowed him to run during the republic of the congo presidential election , 2016 . he won the election believed by many to be fraudulent . after violent protest in the capital , sassou attacked the pool region , where the ninja ( militia ) s of the civil war used to be based , in what wa believed to be a distraction . this led to a revival of the ninja rebel who launched attack against the army in april 2016 , leading 80,000 people to flee their home . a ceasefire deal wa signed in december 2017.
